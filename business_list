Va decent italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus, flat breads, salads, soups, and pasta. outdoor seating is available in nice weather, and the service is friendly. overall, not a bad place, but not super exciting either - pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  point brugge cafe. it also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation, and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people.

Vi wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at point brugge cafe.  while my friends and i were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  i'm glad he did!  the menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular pointe brugge up the street: mussels and fries.\u000a\u000ait happened to be lasagna night.  because i am used to the home cooked variety, i had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  i selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  both were very good.  the gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  didn't get a chance to try dessert.\u000a\u000aboth items i had were rather tasty, and i would easily come back here for a great meal.

Vi made it back here about two weeks ago.  i must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of july.  whether or not it was an off night i do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  i should have just waited it out at point brugge.  i won't becoming back anytime soon.

Vi've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  we literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.

Vi often have lunch at the nearby point brugge cafe, but i decided to give pino's a try today for a change of pace.  bad idea.  my lady friend and i started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "italian frites."  the latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  the greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 freakin' dollars for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  talk about a profit margin!\u000a\u000aas a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  it was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the fm radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant?  classless.\u000a\u000aconclusion: i'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at point brugge than be seated immediately at pino's.

Vit's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. i discovered pino's after deciding that the wait for point brugge simply wasn't worth it.\u000a\u000athe brunch was very good, i enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the "missing" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.\u000a\u000amy sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition.

Vi must admit that the first time i went to pino's (about 6 months ago), i was not a fan for several reasons.  however, after coming home from brunch, the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind, but to keep me coming back.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend had the scallops and i have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  my boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  his eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  he said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.\u000amy dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.  \u000a\u000aoverall, i am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  we'll definitely be back for brunch.

Vpino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. a relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in point breeze would be to enjoy the amazing point brugge cafe just down the street. as a previous reviewer mentioned, i stopped in simply because the brugge was full, but i unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.

Vwhat a disappointment!! evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \u000awe had reservations for 5 people at 7pm this past saturday. two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. she was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. when the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), i informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  she told me it would be awhile. huh? when asked what "awhile" was, she said 20min.  but then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which i take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\u000a\u000afood was a let down. potato latkes were greasy and blah.  fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  others had the same sentiments.\u000a\u000aservice was rough.  long waits and lack of attentiveness. noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\u000anot sure pino's will get a repeat visit.  disappointment:(

Vin similar fashion to joseph s. i, too, decided to give pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby point brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. it was a relatively nice evening, and i thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. we were immediately greeted by jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. i made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that i found to be very interesting. \u000a\u000ai really loved the bistro burger. i requested it to be prepared "medium", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times i've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. we also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. i thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. we really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. i was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. my partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which i found to have that "homemade" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado i was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. \u000a\u000aoverall we loved our experience and will be back! we were told about pino's legendary sunday brunches, and i look forward to trying one myself the next sunday i have off from work.

Vas a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), i desperately missed home-style chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. things turned around for me once i got a car (or made friends with cars), but i was seriously hurting for a while.\u000a\u000atasty was one of the places we found. back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning chinese family. they had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. if they were in nyc, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. the food was pretty good, and if you order in chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because "your parents teach you good to talk chineees". \u000a\u000ai'm pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now. the food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. it's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. the customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\u000a\u000athe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. the food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. don't expect grandma's cooking, though. order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. they have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for orient kitchen. try things, and share your thoughts.\u000a\u000atasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\u000a\u000a- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Vpretty solid chinese takeout.  they have a $10 minimum on campus food and delivered in less time than expected.  the szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all, but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, corn, carrots, etc.).  the vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - i don't know that i would order them again.\u000a\u000aoverall, i'm pretty pleased.  i already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says "tasty" on the storefront.   (this is how i'm going to refer to it - ie, "do you want some takeout from tasty?")  i also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice, soup & an egg roll for $2.95!  i will almost definitely order from here again.

Vfood: there are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  we've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  the general tso's tofu and the moo shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  the eggplant was soggy and not great.  the portions are large.  nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\u000a\u000aprice: tasty is cheap.  \u000a\u000adrinks: n/a\u000a\u000aatmosphere: typical chinese takeout place.  a photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  located in the plaza next to pizza parma.  decent location for that end of shadyside.\u000a\u000aservice: the employees speak poor english but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  the food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\u000a\u000a(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\u000a\u000a(-): food is nothing to write home about\u000a\u000awould i go back again? if i'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.

Vthis place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall chinese restaurant. there's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. i decided to give tasty a try because it's conveniently located on highland avenue and has easy parking.\u000a\u000ai ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon. sadly, they prepared kung pao beef instead. it's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. it's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. while it wasn't what i ordered, the food was good...but there is better chinese food out there.

Vnote: tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\u000a\u000atasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. before i continue, i will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(as was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(i assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  however, i will chalk some of it up to my mistake because i thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. so, tasty, you get a pass on the rice\u000a\u000aanyhow, i ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(i've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). i ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. i want surface area, and i don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. i will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\u000a\u000athe eggroll, as i said, was tough.. it tasted good, but it was tough, and small... this probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum i do need to order something else with my tofu... i hope the soup is good.\u000a\u000athe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when i ordered. portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, i'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.

Vmy wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  this is our go-to chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  i have never had a bad meal here, and i will forever love their beef chow fun!  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days, and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  these are great folks, and i wish them the best of success in the future.  remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at tasty!

Vtasty is pittsburgh's best kept secret for cantonese cuisine. if you're chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! the service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! did i mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?\u000a\u000adon't order the american standards of general tso's and moo goo gai pan , unless you really want to. this is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. \u000a\u000aif you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). and they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. the owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. if you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. they do not serve alcohol, its a byob place. the best part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  \u000a\u000amy husband and i have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  the owners are really nice and the food is great!

Vordered the lunch special with sesame bean curd + steamed rice + veggie egg roll.  the food was great, and you get a lot for $5.65.  my friend got general tso's chicken with fried rice, and she enjoyed her meal as well.\u000a\u000athe lady at the counter was very friendly and refilled our waters often during lunch.  when we were done eating, she gave us little japanese mango gummy candies on our way at the door.\u000a\u000ai would definitely come back for lunch here--it's nothing fancy, but very reasonably priced and, well, tasty. :)

Vhome of the italian army.\u000a\u000avento's is located in the east liberty section of pittsburgh right next to home depot. they have been in business forever! they are a pizza and hoagie shop. they are famous for their italian army hoagie. i have friends that as soon as they land in pittsburgh they come straight to vento's for the pizza! it is sicilian style pizza and it is delicious! everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. it's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\u000a\u000athey have tables and booths for seating. you can even play the pa lottery there. \u000a\u000ano debit or credit cards. cash only!\u000a\u000a(f.y.i. there is a generic atm that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)

Vi had heard lots of good things about vento's. unfortunately i did not get to experience these things. the service was slow and lukewarm. the pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. also, no credit or debit cards here.  you're directed to the atm in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   i ordered ahead and although i had to wait for my pizza when i got there i received it cold and it just was not that good.  i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.

Vventos is an east end tradition.   the sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   it is more of a traditional working-clasd pittsburgh style crust-square, and bread like.  sicilian pizza comes in square cuts by the way,  if you like the doughy (dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust, or brick oven designer pizza you might not like vento's pizza.  but i happen to love vento's pizza!!!   they also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  this is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  everything i've had from here is good.

Vwe were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. found this place, read reviews on yelp which were ok, and decided to ordered two slices. hum...sorry not slices. more like two squares of cheesy bread. when we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. we obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! they also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\u000ait also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. since i was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. definitely never going there if we come to visit again!

Vhorrible food don't waste your money\u000a\u000athis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had, i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\u000a\u000aloudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \u000a\u000ai looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.

Vwhat a wonderful hidden gem!\u000amy boyfriend and i have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  the service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful.  the food isn't 5 star, but it is really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!\u000asure the pizza may not be cut into "pizza shape," but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  everything i have ever had here is wonderful and i will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business.

Voh i love this place. their pizzas are square/rectangle! a single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. it is in the strangest location (home depot's parking lot)!! the picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. love this place!

Von my recent road trip from dallas to new haven, ct, randy s. and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms. this, i must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, "there's nothing *in* pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" \u000a\u000atazza d'oro is the answer to that question. especially if you like coffee. this is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the mississippi, and i've been to a lot of them. so, what's so good about it?\u000a\u000alet's go in order of importance:\u000a\u000acoffee - it is really, really good. they use batdorf and bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in olympia. believe me when i tell you that b&b is good. it's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good i always get a latte. why? this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. i got a latte. they have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one i got. it was fantastic. they did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \u000a\u000athe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) i had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. it was always superior. \u000a\u000athis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \u000a\u000apastries - they all looked amazing. i had a plain donut while i waited in line. normally i don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\u000a\u000aatmosphere - this place has it exactly right. it's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. very friendly employees. just a complete home run. \u000a\u000aobviously i loved it. behind me in line for my re-up, i heard a girl behind me in line complain, "we could just go to starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. that's fine. everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, i don't blame people for being set that way. but the beautiful thing about tazza d'oro (cup of gold in italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloween.\u000a\u000atazza d'oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to pittsburgh.

Vthis place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. it offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. still ha that neighborhood feel though. i have never had food there though they offer paninis. great desserts. good espressos and okay coffee.outdoor seating. good place to study. plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.

Vthis is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. it took me far too long to come around and love tazza d'oro. a horrible ex of mine loved this place and i admit that this soured me. i regret the time i wasted not going here. the dark wood inside comforts me. the small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \u000a\u000atazza d'oro brews batdorf and bronson beans (amazing), provides enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs i've ever met (amazing). everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \u000a\u000athey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but i have never actually eaten it. the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia, wa. i talked about this with one of the barristas at td'o and they were offended - "we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different." sorry, tazza d'oro, you are better. \u000a\u000athe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. there's a sense of community nestled here, just off the "main drag" of highland park, between bryant st. and the reservoir. this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. the percentage of students is low. like the rest of pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally i see people i like and miss, which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me.

Vdo you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  i am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  i am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  it is 11:30 on a monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.\u000a\u000ait is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.\u000a\u000aenrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.\u000a\u000aother reasons to love this place (i know some of the other reviews highlighted these but i thought they were worth repeating).\u000a\u000a- free wifi\u000a- outside tables\u000a- tasty treats\u000a- they have a blog!\u000a- really great coffee\u000a- the staff are coffee experts

Vtazza d'oro has a generally european decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. the espresso is, bar none, the best i've had - including my admittedly limited travels in italy. it's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\u000a\u000athe coffee is also terrific, and tazza d'oro uses batdorf & bronson beans - the best i've ever had for home grinding. they have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\u000a\u000ain addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; i'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends i've tried were all memorably flavorful.\u000a\u000aall that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. no one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.

Vbest independent coffeeshop i've ever had the pleasure to visit.\u000a\u000abest americano i've ever had.  some of the best espresso i've ever had.  great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  good food.  the employees are awesome.\u000a\u000athe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  the shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.

Vone of my favorite coffee places in pittsburgh. they also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good.

Vthe coffee here is amazing (i love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). the baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. while there are a number of tables, enrico's was busy even on a friday night...i would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.

Vdelicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste, but really tasty flavors and spices. we went for all-you-can-eat wings night but sadly i could barely finish my first dozen. beer selection is much improved since  turadg a.'s post; they have about 30 or so available to choose from.

Vthe main reasons to go to buffalo blues would be for their all you can eat ribs night every tuesday for $21 and their all you can eat wings night every wednesday for $9.  make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  you have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  i once went to ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a buffalo chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\u000a\u000aanyways.  the food itself.  the ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  i tend to just go medium, b/c i find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when i eat ribs i care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  the ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  the most i've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because i didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\u000a\u000apersonally i prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  they have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are buffalo blue, old yeller, and red hot parm.  buffalo blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, old yeller is a carolina mustard based sauce, and red hot parm is a traditional buffalo sauce (frank's red hot + butter) then topped with parmesan cheese.  their cool ranch, garlic parm, and spicy garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, i kind of like their spicy garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  their gold rush and death row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but i prefer buffalo blue to both of them.\u000a\u000afor their spicy flavors, there's red hot, which is just a traditional buffalo, there's howlin' wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's hotter than hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  personally i find howlin' wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  i tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so i'm not big on hotter than hell.\u000a\u000aif i have a big appetite i eat from 24-30 wings.  if its just a regular day i'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\u000a\u000anote: these wings are huge.  they aren't your typical wingzone or quaker steak and lube sized wings.  these are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\u000a\u000athe rest of the menu is just typical american restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\u000a\u000ahighly highly recommended.

Vliving down the street of buffalo blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  the huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  for any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good.\u000a\u000athe bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  it's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  but, while they have a good number of hd tvs, only two are broadcast in hd so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.

Vin the last week i've been here twice, partially because i don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! it's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\u000a\u000ai tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than sharp edge's. the sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. to wash it down i had loose cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\u000a\u000aour waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. who makes a new girl work on a friday night! she seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because i wasn't hungry anymore so i didn't care.\u000a\u000athe beer was pricy - tuesday night i had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...

Vthe front serves as a good pittsburgh sports bar. it's a particularly great place to watch the penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. there are lots of hdtv's and there is a good selection of beer. \u000a\u000athe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. i would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.

Vi've been here quite a few times, and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt. they have a ton of nice hdtvs.\u000a\u000aeverytime i go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that i get. i was just there for the pitt/oakland game and got a redhook. i drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\u000a\u000athe food is hit or miss. i got the french onion soup last time. it was good. nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. i've had the pork nachos and they were blah.

Vi found buffalo blues to be merely ok.  i thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  i actually liked the wing sauces i tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \u000a\u000ai would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  for $10 i would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was ok.\u000a\u000asurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  a vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

Vtried this place to get my charred meat on before a steelers game, and was not disappointed.  boneless buffalo wings are my loovveeeeeeeee so i'm pretty easy to please there, and i was super happy that they allow you to order them in a small portion (5 wings).  i tried a medium spicy sauce (instead of jumping right to hotter 'n hell) because i was sick with anticipation for the steelers game, and it was nice and sweet and not bland.  \u000a\u000apredicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, i had a salad.  i expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!  the lettuce was not all nearly white grossness, the other veggies were nice and crisp, and the toppings were great!  i loovveeed the shredded chicken that didn't have a bunch of gross grease all over it.

Vwednesday is wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. for ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. if you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\u000a\u000ai've mostly had the wings at blues & i like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (especially if her name is meg).

Vthis is a great place for happy hour, to catch the game, or to have a small-ish private party. definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials, but mon-fri from 5-7pm they have \u000a$1 off all drafts\u000a1/2 priced blues booze\u000a$5 nachos and quesadillas\u000a$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)\u000a\u000aeast end beers are $3 all day, every day.\u000a\u000athe food here is not spectacular, but i've always enjoyed what i've gotten. being from the south, i wouldn't think to order the bbq or catfish here, so i can't vouch for those. the spicy wings, cheese sticks, salads, and grilled cheese are all good. the regulars and servers are pretty nice people. we watched the saint/steelers game here (with our saints attire on!), and easily made friends the whole night. they also have a small "loft" area that you can reserve for free for a private party, and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. finally, they deliver! i love having another delivery option besides chinese and pizza. now i can be lazy and eat a big salad!

Vmy coworkers and i had lunch here on a friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "meh" experience for me.  we were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that i didn't even know existed, so apparently buffalo blues is bigger than i thought.  it's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\u000a\u000ai went for the hot veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  the sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  the sandwich left something to be desired.  it wasn't hot, first of all - i'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  the hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  there wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  it was just belly-filler, really.  i guess that's what i get for trying to order healthy here.  \u000a\u000ai just wasn't much interested in it, and i don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  i better have a darn good sandwich if i'm paying $8.  also, it was relatively small in size - i don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  but i guess i think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that i can take half home.  buffalo blues was neither.\u000a\u000anot particularly interested in returning for any reason.

Vchina garden appears to be your run of the mill chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but i was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  we had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  i'd easily say this is the best chinese takeout place i've found since i've been in pittsburgh (about a year).  highly recommend it.

Vi've said it before, and i'll say it again, i love me a buffet.\u000a\u000aan excellent price for some good food never hurts.  all the usual chinese fare is on the buffet with that american flare added for some spice...i suppose it would be to spice it up...  anyway  i got to taste all my favorite chinese foods from general tso's to cheese won tons.  just in case i didn't want to overdose on chinese i decided to try some of the mac n' cheese and fried potatoes (although i admit i added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).  \u000a\u000aservers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.  \u000a\u000ai would have given five stars, but as my friend pointed out while we were there, our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  next time i'll go with the soda i suppose.

Vthis is my go-to place for curing a hangover. i don't know what it is about chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. i also like to come here before i go grocery shopping at the nearby trader joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\u000a\u000aall of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, i haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. another thing i miss is creamed spinach... i have yet to see this dish on a pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among chines buffets.\u000a\u000aanother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.

Vthe hot and sour soup was ok. everything else was basically inedible. water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. more than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be "krab", considering the price of the buffet. no pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.

Vthe food here is good but it is not exceptional. \u000a\u000a i've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. there is the typical asian fare such as general tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. there is also american macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \u000a\u000awhen i go to china garden, i always request a carry out container as i find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. one thing for sure is that china garden gets plenty of customers.\u000a\u000adefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!

Vjust ate there, right next to gamestop & google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. at the end of the meal i was just eating onions with rice, though i hear this is healthy for you. counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, "have a nice day" #awkward. i know that english isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (i usually get this feeling eating asian). this is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (side note: food is very clean. brushed my teeth an hour before w/ tom's of maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)

Vthe location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food. i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon. they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. i won't go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok. they didn't give any sauce. you have to ask for it. that sucks.

Vthis is my 2nd time here and i thought that i attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact i was sooooo hungry. well my 2nd time and for a chinese buffet, this place is fantastic. the restaurant itself is very clean. the buffet is also very clean and even though i showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. the amount of choice is less than just about all the chinese buffets that i have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. all the patrons here are american, so this isn't the asian place where the asians eat. it's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. i would certainly return. giving it 7.5 knuckles out of 11.

Vthis is an average chinese buffet. the food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap american food. the food was a little too greasy even by american chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after i left that place. to me, that's a no-go signal.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.

Vi think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... the chicken is quality meat and its lightly sauted but the sauce is to blah. it's a nice place to sit down and have chinese food if you have no other local options.  \u000a\u000ait's my last resort for chinese food in the area. prices are absurd!!!

Vi ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  the pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy, sauce was good.  i should have ordered the large instead of the medium. i would definitely order from here again.

Vprovolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. the pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. i had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay.

Vworst pizza i've had in pittsburgh. i ordered from here last weekend. the pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. the buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily i had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \u000a\u000amaybe it was one bad night, and i can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, i can't recommend this place to anyone.

Vahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 pm, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. i got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. the pizza was decent. there was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. i felt sick before i got halfway through it. that reminds me - the slices are huge, and are $2. the onion rings were extremely basic - i gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\u000aone irritating thing i overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like "we don't have those anymore" or "no, we can't cook wings dry." sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.

Vi had some pizza from pizza parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  a colleague brought it in, so i didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  i had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  it was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  i was starving so i really enjoyed it, but i think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, i'd say go for it.  just don't have very high expectations.

Vpizza parma has many of the characteristics i like in a pizza joint. \u000a1) they deliver when they say they will, \u000a2) diverse menu and toppings, \u000a3) coupons, \u000a4) online ordering, and \u000a5) take credit cards. \u000a\u000ai think pizza parma shines with their specialty pizzas. artichoke, buffalo chicken, spinach & feta, and greek pies are all delicious. i've also had some of their pasta dishes, and i can't complain. it's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. pizza parma fails on wings, though. the texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. desserts are also not worth the buy.

Vi've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  i also should have known that i shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\u000a\u000ai figured i'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  i opted for the popcorn chicken salad.  sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \u000a\u000ai have to say that even though i was saying yes, my body was saying, 'oh hell no!'\u000a\u000ai'm regretting this decision now as i am sitting here in discomfort.  not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  but i'm not liking the effect i'm getting right now.  could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\u000a\u000ai'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.

Vjimmy tsang's chinese restaurant is one of the old "traditional" pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always "being there."  my parents feel the same way about it.  it is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \u000a\u000ai don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed i prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that i've always wanted to try--sau la gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  perhaps i've never noticed, but i don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  it was good, but hoo-boy did i have to pace myself while eating it.  and have plenty of water nearby!  sau la gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and i doubt i'll have it again.\u000a\u000amy friend maryann tried  ching za gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  i sampled it and perhaps i will order that for myself next time.  i'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \u000a\u000amore to my tastes however are the garden chicken, chicken with broccoli, or beef with pea pods.  seafood dishes include sweet and sour shrimp and  sauteed shrimp szechaun style.  yeah, i'm a little unimaginative when it comes to chinese food, but i know what i like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\u000a\u000ajimmy tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  the place also does korean barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.

Vyou can see their second bar through the front windows.  i always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\u000a\u000ain other words, this place is *huge* inside.  the place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; i like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \u000a\u000achinese and korean food, at or above my expectations.  the stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.

Vi happen to stumble upon jimmy tsang's while up in pittsburgh visiting. i must say, the food is really good. the service was great - but i only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out. we liked it so much, we got take out for my family 2 nights later. \u000a\u000athe woman that runs the front is very nice / sociable and likes to talk about each dish. she has great suggestions for your taste. her husband is the chef (they are both from korea) and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years. if you like chinese food, you will love this place. it also has two cool bars inside. \u000a\u000ai highly recommend this place. the reason why i give it 4 stars is because we got take out - not sure how table service is, but i'm sure it would be good with the nice people working there.... \u000a\u000aa must try! i bet it would be a cool first date kind of place....

Vwalking into jimmy tsang's was like walking into the chinese restaurant that was on hawaii five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\u000a\u000ahot & sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\u000awonton soup was a very large portion and good.\u000a\u000aegg rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\u000acheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\u000achinese flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\u000aflaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\u000a\u000atea tasted like american lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\u000a\u000athe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.

Vi really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  first, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  i'm writing this review after going there twice.  the first time my husband and i went, the dinner was good.  we thought this place has the potential to be our go-to chinese restaurant in pgh.  today i remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  the won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  the entree was fine.  \u000a\u000awhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  the smell wouldn't leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as i could) to get rid of the smell.  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \u000a\u000a[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]

Vhey, jimmy! cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! the early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\u000ai had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). i'm going to avoid this place until i get a craving to drink tobacco.

Vi was expecting a lot more from jt but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way. it merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. the idea was cute. they even have typical chinese lunch specials.\u000a\u000athe deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. \u000a\u000ai had a craving for comfort food and ordered jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. the tea and water was served as i sat down. i went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. the calamari came out promptly and the jajangmyeon took a little longer. the portions were huge! \u000a\u000awhat took the longest and annoyed me the most (i was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes? they never came the clear the table or walked by so that i could signal that i needed the check. i should have just walked out. the food was okay but i seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn't help with. you may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break.

Vthis place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  now...  not so much.  well, during hh, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  selection by the glass is limited.  \u000a\u000aas for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  i haven't really been disappointed yet!  the appetizers/small plates all pretty good, i really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  the salads are good and although i haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, i hear great things from my friends.  the entrees are always excellent - i usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  the signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  the desserts are ok, personally, i feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \u000a\u000aoh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  and it is nice that you can order veuve cliquot by the glass ($16).\u000a\u000aprices are a bit high for what you'd expect for pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, i would recommend it.\u000a\u000ap.s. i have heard that they have a great brunch on sundays. i personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments i hear, it's probably worth the try!\u000a\u000a-------------------------\u000aupdate 12/9/07:  went to the brunch.  what a great deal!  for $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  they have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  the smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  the truffled potato was yummy.  the arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  and for entree, we both got the casbah benedict.  i have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  i think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!

Vwell it's official shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  damn you big burrito group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  i was here last night and on a monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  the space itself is beautiful.  you  enter from s. highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  there is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  the design is contemporary.  the bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  the one thing i dislike about the bar area is that the "stools" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your "neighbor" is pre-determined.  i also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  the wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  the hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  the server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  we ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and i guess in line with what others charge.  we were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta i think.  the tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but i guess it's what i should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  the bread was great.  it was warm really hearty bread that was wheat i think, definitely not white.  it was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  really good start.  we then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  i'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  it also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  the only thing i was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  however, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  we also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  the pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  the sauce and lamb were amazing.  this would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  the only detraction i'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  we also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  by the time we got to this i think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  this is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  but, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  i tried the elysian fields lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  this was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  i actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  the bartenders are good, especially fionaoverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.

Vthe food here is pretty good.  comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  the lamb is definitely good.  and it is definitely a good date restaurant.  i would rather give it 3.5 stars since i've definitely eaten at better restaurants. but for pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.

Vi went to casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. they use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. i had the house made granola which was just amazing! toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. after the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a bellini and a cup of coffee, i had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag ("the rest" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\u000a\u000amy only complaint would be how long everything took. while i love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. i go into brunch groggy, then i have coffee and yummy food, and i'm totally amped, ready to face the day! and then i get to sit. and wait. anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now i'll know to make time the next time i go. which is for dinner for a friends birthday. so excited!!

Vcan be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  we had a cheese tasting simply because i *never* pass up pleasant ridge reserve when given the opportunity.  they also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from cypress grove.  nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  i had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  the feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  i spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\u000a\u000aservice was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.

Vafter a long day of recruiting at cmu, i arranged a dinner for 16 people here in casbah... prefix menu, over all the experience was ok.\u000a\u000abreak down:\u000ascallops - appetizer - i had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  \u000afillet mignon - entree - very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the silicon valley or even some of the chain steak places like morton's.\u000adessert - the highlight of the of the meal.  mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  it was amazing.  the consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  it wasn't too dense or too liquidy.\u000a\u000abeing a big burrito restaurant, i expected more but it was good nonetheless.

Vso i went back to casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. the granola i had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. the service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. definitely go for brunch! but it's not worth the money for dinner. mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food...

Vi'm not sure why this place is called casbah.  casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.\u000a\u000athat aside, good food and great service.  definitely a place to impress.  i especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although casbah is not doing the whole "locavore" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  so, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.\u000a\u000awe started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  but the calamari was meaty and perfectly fried.  i actually had to stop because i was feeling ill from eating too many of them.\u000a\u000awe all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  quite sizeable too, given the setting.  finally, i had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (i have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  which was quite good.  i actually would have preferred it over linguine, i think, but whatever.  it was deelish.\u000a\u000anot sure why i'm not giving this place five stars.  i really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a wow experience.  better luck next time perhaps.

Vanother great big burrito restaurant, casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\u000a\u000athe three dinning rooms, "outside," inside and downstairs.  while downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  perfect for a larger group of people.  outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\u000a\u000athe food is mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. the hummus here was actually the first hummus that i had ever had and i am sorry to say it is what i compare all other to, few match up.\u000a\u000athe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to soba.  if you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, casbah is it.

Vmy best friend and i went here for dinner today and were very pleased - though i do have to say that we both had our free birthday entrees and that undoubtedly influenced things.  i was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.\u000a\u000awe started with two big glasses of sangria.  i thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or i got used to it.\u000a\u000ai had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  i had never had morels before and now i understand why they're so pricey.  there was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  the risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind i wish i could make myself.  my best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  i tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.\u000a\u000awe split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote happy birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  the creme brulee was good but definitely not the best i've ever had.  (that award may go to soba's coffee creme brulee.)\u000a\u000athe total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  but it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  the patio was lovely.  i will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!

Vexcellent place for brunch.  for $22, i had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  reservations available through open table.  this is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.

Vexcellent excellent brunch spot.  for review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\u000a\u000acasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  i ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  i started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  my companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\u000a\u000awhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\u000a\u000athe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  there was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  i tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\u000a\u000amy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  i love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  the braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  the best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  this dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  i tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (i think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\u000a\u000aservice was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, and they take reservations.  sometimes i don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (point brugge, coca cafe, etc.), but most times i'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

Vout of the big burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. and this is just not a one time bad experience, i have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.\u000a\u000aservice has always been good and attentive i enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or i expected much better for the money i am paying. for example:\u000a\u000asumac scallop appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is i can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant i am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.\u000a\u000arisotto - over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.\u000a\u000aduck entre, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. i even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.\u000a\u000apasta entre with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.\u000a\u000aif this was some little bistro where i was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) i wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money i expect a little more attention to detail.

Vi ate here in january and was very impressed. we ate in the basement, although casbah has two floors and outdoor seating. i thought the atmosphere was very good, and the fish (i forget the exact dish) was well-prepared.\u000a\u000athis is on the expensive side, but worth it for a special occasion.

Vi've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and i'd have to say that generally, i'm a fan.  their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  it was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\u000a\u000ai came back for dinner a month or so later.  we had reservations (on a monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  we sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, mediterranean garden.  and yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  even with my young eyes, i still needed a candle to read the menu.  but it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  a little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\u000a\u000athe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  i actually had a cocktail to start - the perfect pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  there was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  it was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors i love.  still, for the price, i think the portion was a little stingy.  when i buy an $11 cocktail, i like it to really fill the glass.  we nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - i think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  it was a bit bland - i think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\u000a\u000athings got better during the actual dinner.  i ordered the heritage farms chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  it's just squash!  but somehow, it was heavenly.  my friend enjoyed her cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  i tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  the only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  i tasted them too, and i have to say - it was off-putting.  perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\u000a\u000awe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  i didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  i enjoyed our creme brulee - because i enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \u000a\u000aoverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  i had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  but this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  i think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.

Vthis is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  we were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  i highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in pittsburgh.  the arugula salad is delicious.  so is the alaskan halibut.  you really can't go wrong with casbah.

Vpros: vegan food in pittsburgh?  yes!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor\u000a\u000acons: not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me\u000a\u000ahi, i am a non-drinker and rarely have i found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  granted, quiet storm like many pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  ginger lemonade?  yes.  all these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  yeah!\u000a\u000ai do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but i attribute that to my love of meaty things).  they used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but i think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  too bad most of pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.\u000a\u000ausually good music acts here.  although the few times i was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group i dragged along and the band's friends.  usually 2-3 acts play.  live.  and it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  and be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  \u000a\u000athe bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.\u000a\u000ai have never been here during the daytime so i can't comment on that.  always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  there are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.

Vthough i didn't get a chance to visit this place when i visited last month, i really do love quiet storm and i will be sure i hit it up next time i'm in town visiting my friends there. the decor is adorable. the prices are reasonable. it was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. i really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart pittsburgh. it's truly a unique space.

Vi used to live about four blocks from the quiet storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and i would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to quiet storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  and then usually i'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  but i'm sorry, what is it i'm reviewing here?\u000a\u000athe quiet storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble i've ever had.  i'm an accomplished vegan eater (i get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), i've had the best scrambles new york and san francisco have to offer.  believe you me, quiet storm tops them all.  i wish i knew their secret recipe, but the part i do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  come in on a lazy sunday morning, get the nothin' fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  on top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  plus, sandwiches!  get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\u000a\u000aand and, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  get there early.

Vi like the quiet storm because it offers food as well as drinks.  the spinach artichoke dip and white pita pizza is good.  i never had a chai milkshake until i went to the quiet storm.  if you can deal with east end "urbanites" then i would suggest trying it out, if nothing for a good laugh and decent food.

Vi moved to pittsburgh for the tempeh reuben at quiet storm.  actually, i'm lying.  or maybe not.  am i trying to save face because i don't want to admit that i moved across the country for a sandwich?  you'll never know because i'm not telling.\u000a\u000aanyway, the food here is pretty good.  sometimes it's better than others, though i think it depends on the cooks.  i'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies, right?), so i like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  i'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base, too.  the menu is creative, and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops, which i appreciate.  \u000a\u000athe atmosphere is nice here: big, open space, yet cozy.  and you won't find a radder floor in pittsburgh.  the employees are super nice.

Vit's all about the black & gold. (only on the brunch menu now, though!)\u000a\u000aand the tofu tenders.\u000a\u000aand the vegan baked goods from my goodies.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes. sorbet does not a milkshake make.

Vi looove quiet storm! it's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient atm's around, the closest business is a mcdonald's half a mile away. and i still go there every chance i get. \u000a\u000ahipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is really child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). but generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.\u000a\u000athe menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!\u000a\u000aa lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. but my favorite are their dinner salads. they're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. and their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.\u000a\u000aoh, and the drink menu! i'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so i haven't tried too much on it. but everything looks amazing. quiet storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!

Vthis place is cool!  but it is also 'cool'.  service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  and i'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. the menu is also huge.  \u000a\u000afor those of you looking for an atm- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\u000a\u000ai could always find a table and spread out with my books. comfy, young, hip, worth it.  i wish they had alcohol.\u000a\u000atry it!

Vit's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  the coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  generally, i wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you might catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.

Vfood is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. location is inconvenient and i would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of penn. service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. i can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\u000a\u000a**************\u000aokay i won't change my rating, but i take back what i said about the food. they have changed the menu and it is really bad. \u000a\u000awe had buffalo tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \u000a\u000ai had the thai peanut tofu wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \u000a\u000ai don't understand the point of mockamole? it's made with peas instead of avocado. \u000a\u000ahow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \u000a\u000ai would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \u000a\u000aokay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. i was completely disappointed.

Vfor solid veggie/vegan food in pittsburgh's east end, the qs is a reliable meat-free choice. there are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned qs diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. the scrambled tofu is a shining star. the kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. the salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad i've eaten in pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with french fries! nothing here is fried - even the "fried" foods are baked. your arteries are grateful. the kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. \u000a\u000athis used to be the place to brunch, and i'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but i had to quit when all these suv families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the qs made it into some kind of "visit pennsylvania" travel guide as a great brunch spot. i hate to be that "i liked their old stuff better" kind of a person, but, well... \u000a\u000adon't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the qs means making a special atm run. \u000a\u000athe qs is super kid-friendly. books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). the menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. i wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds i know. \u000a\u000athe drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. the espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. you may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. no liquor license but you can byob for a nominal charge. \u000a\u000athe service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. i would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. \u000a\u000aif you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too. i do wish the hours were a little different - i operate on the schedule of a late-nite diner, though.

Vwe go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. it's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). my bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  homefries with tofu instead of eggs. the waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. this establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\u000a\u000aon cold wintery days try a mexican hot chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!

Vthe quiet storm is a classic, being one of the largest selections of vegetarian and vegan entrees in the city. recently came with about 13 people for a saturday lunch. i won't speak for everyone's dish, but i got the curry which was very tasty, if not a bit skimpy on the rice and a little thin for my liking. my friend got the qhf, which is a tofu scramble mixed with home fries and seisage which was absolutely delicious. she also got a side of spicy aioli which went extremely well with the breakfast dish. the service was prompt and they just left pitchers of water on the table for us which was great. always a great choice for meat-eaters and veggie's alike. if you go with a large group though, beware because it is difficult to work in the added gratuity and tax with the cash-only. the waiter wouldn't let us split it up and take individually, so it was difficult on that end.

Vwe've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!\u000a\u000areally excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. i had the breakfast burrito, which i thought was ok, but not something i would order again. but, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, i felt like i was in the mission in sf (ok, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in ca). kid friendly too, if that's important to you.
