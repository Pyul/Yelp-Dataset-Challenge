Va decent italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus, flat breads, salads, soups, and pasta. outdoor seating is available in nice weather, and the service is friendly. overall, not a bad place, but not super exciting either - pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  point brugge cafe. it also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation, and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people.

Vi wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at point brugge cafe.  while my friends and i were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  i'm glad he did!  the menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular pointe brugge up the street: mussels and fries.\u000a\u000ait happened to be lasagna night.  because i am used to the home cooked variety, i had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  i selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  both were very good.  the gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  didn't get a chance to try dessert.\u000a\u000aboth items i had were rather tasty, and i would easily come back here for a great meal.

Vi made it back here about two weeks ago.  i must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of july.  whether or not it was an off night i do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  i should have just waited it out at point brugge.  i won't becoming back anytime soon.

Vi've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  we literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.

Vi often have lunch at the nearby point brugge cafe, but i decided to give pino's a try today for a change of pace.  bad idea.  my lady friend and i started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "italian frites."  the latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  the greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 freakin' dollars for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  talk about a profit margin!\u000a\u000aas a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  it was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the fm radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant?  classless.\u000a\u000aconclusion: i'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at point brugge than be seated immediately at pino's.

Vit's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. i discovered pino's after deciding that the wait for point brugge simply wasn't worth it.\u000a\u000athe brunch was very good, i enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the "missing" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.\u000a\u000amy sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition.

Vi must admit that the first time i went to pino's (about 6 months ago), i was not a fan for several reasons.  however, after coming home from brunch, the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind, but to keep me coming back.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend had the scallops and i have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  my boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  his eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  he said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.\u000amy dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.  \u000a\u000aoverall, i am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  we'll definitely be back for brunch.

Vpino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. a relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in point breeze would be to enjoy the amazing point brugge cafe just down the street. as a previous reviewer mentioned, i stopped in simply because the brugge was full, but i unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.

Vwhat a disappointment!! evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \u000awe had reservations for 5 people at 7pm this past saturday. two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. she was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. when the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), i informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  she told me it would be awhile. huh? when asked what "awhile" was, she said 20min.  but then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which i take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\u000a\u000afood was a let down. potato latkes were greasy and blah.  fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  others had the same sentiments.\u000a\u000aservice was rough.  long waits and lack of attentiveness. noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\u000anot sure pino's will get a repeat visit.  disappointment:(

Vin similar fashion to joseph s. i, too, decided to give pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby point brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. it was a relatively nice evening, and i thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. we were immediately greeted by jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. i made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that i found to be very interesting. \u000a\u000ai really loved the bistro burger. i requested it to be prepared "medium", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times i've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. we also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. i thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. we really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. i was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. my partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which i found to have that "homemade" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado i was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. \u000a\u000aoverall we loved our experience and will be back! we were told about pino's legendary sunday brunches, and i look forward to trying one myself the next sunday i have off from work.

Vas a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), i desperately missed home-style chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. things turned around for me once i got a car (or made friends with cars), but i was seriously hurting for a while.\u000a\u000atasty was one of the places we found. back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning chinese family. they had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. if they were in nyc, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. the food was pretty good, and if you order in chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because "your parents teach you good to talk chineees". \u000a\u000ai'm pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now. the food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. it's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. the customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\u000a\u000athe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. the food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. don't expect grandma's cooking, though. order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. they have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for orient kitchen. try things, and share your thoughts.\u000a\u000atasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\u000a\u000a- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Vpretty solid chinese takeout.  they have a $10 minimum on campus food and delivered in less time than expected.  the szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all, but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, corn, carrots, etc.).  the vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - i don't know that i would order them again.\u000a\u000aoverall, i'm pretty pleased.  i already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says "tasty" on the storefront.   (this is how i'm going to refer to it - ie, "do you want some takeout from tasty?")  i also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice, soup & an egg roll for $2.95!  i will almost definitely order from here again.

Vfood: there are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  we've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  the general tso's tofu and the moo shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  the eggplant was soggy and not great.  the portions are large.  nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\u000a\u000aprice: tasty is cheap.  \u000a\u000adrinks: n/a\u000a\u000aatmosphere: typical chinese takeout place.  a photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  located in the plaza next to pizza parma.  decent location for that end of shadyside.\u000a\u000aservice: the employees speak poor english but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  the food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\u000a\u000a(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\u000a\u000a(-): food is nothing to write home about\u000a\u000awould i go back again? if i'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.

Vthis place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall chinese restaurant. there's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. i decided to give tasty a try because it's conveniently located on highland avenue and has easy parking.\u000a\u000ai ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon. sadly, they prepared kung pao beef instead. it's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. it's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. while it wasn't what i ordered, the food was good...but there is better chinese food out there.

Vnote: tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\u000a\u000atasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. before i continue, i will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(as was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(i assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  however, i will chalk some of it up to my mistake because i thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. so, tasty, you get a pass on the rice\u000a\u000aanyhow, i ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(i've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). i ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. i want surface area, and i don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. i will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\u000a\u000athe eggroll, as i said, was tough.. it tasted good, but it was tough, and small... this probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum i do need to order something else with my tofu... i hope the soup is good.\u000a\u000athe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when i ordered. portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, i'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.

Vmy wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  this is our go-to chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  i have never had a bad meal here, and i will forever love their beef chow fun!  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days, and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  these are great folks, and i wish them the best of success in the future.  remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at tasty!

Vtasty is pittsburgh's best kept secret for cantonese cuisine. if you're chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! the service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! did i mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?\u000a\u000adon't order the american standards of general tso's and moo goo gai pan , unless you really want to. this is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. \u000a\u000aif you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). and they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. the owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. if you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. they do not serve alcohol, its a byob place. the best part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  \u000a\u000amy husband and i have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  the owners are really nice and the food is great!

Vordered the lunch special with sesame bean curd + steamed rice + veggie egg roll.  the food was great, and you get a lot for $5.65.  my friend got general tso's chicken with fried rice, and she enjoyed her meal as well.\u000a\u000athe lady at the counter was very friendly and refilled our waters often during lunch.  when we were done eating, she gave us little japanese mango gummy candies on our way at the door.\u000a\u000ai would definitely come back for lunch here--it's nothing fancy, but very reasonably priced and, well, tasty. :)

Vhome of the italian army.\u000a\u000avento's is located in the east liberty section of pittsburgh right next to home depot. they have been in business forever! they are a pizza and hoagie shop. they are famous for their italian army hoagie. i have friends that as soon as they land in pittsburgh they come straight to vento's for the pizza! it is sicilian style pizza and it is delicious! everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. it's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\u000a\u000athey have tables and booths for seating. you can even play the pa lottery there. \u000a\u000ano debit or credit cards. cash only!\u000a\u000a(f.y.i. there is a generic atm that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)

Vi had heard lots of good things about vento's. unfortunately i did not get to experience these things. the service was slow and lukewarm. the pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. also, no credit or debit cards here.  you're directed to the atm in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   i ordered ahead and although i had to wait for my pizza when i got there i received it cold and it just was not that good.  i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.

Vventos is an east end tradition.   the sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   it is more of a traditional working-clasd pittsburgh style crust-square, and bread like.  sicilian pizza comes in square cuts by the way,  if you like the doughy (dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust, or brick oven designer pizza you might not like vento's pizza.  but i happen to love vento's pizza!!!   they also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  this is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  everything i've had from here is good.

Vwe were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. found this place, read reviews on yelp which were ok, and decided to ordered two slices. hum...sorry not slices. more like two squares of cheesy bread. when we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. we obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! they also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\u000ait also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. since i was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. definitely never going there if we come to visit again!

Vhorrible food don't waste your money\u000a\u000athis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had, i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\u000a\u000aloudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \u000a\u000ai looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.

Vwhat a wonderful hidden gem!\u000amy boyfriend and i have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  the service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful.  the food isn't 5 star, but it is really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!\u000asure the pizza may not be cut into "pizza shape," but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  everything i have ever had here is wonderful and i will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business.

Voh i love this place. their pizzas are square/rectangle! a single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. it is in the strangest location (home depot's parking lot)!! the picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. love this place!

Von my recent road trip from dallas to new haven, ct, randy s. and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms. this, i must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, "there's nothing *in* pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" \u000a\u000atazza d'oro is the answer to that question. especially if you like coffee. this is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the mississippi, and i've been to a lot of them. so, what's so good about it?\u000a\u000alet's go in order of importance:\u000a\u000acoffee - it is really, really good. they use batdorf and bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in olympia. believe me when i tell you that b&b is good. it's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good i always get a latte. why? this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. i got a latte. they have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one i got. it was fantastic. they did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \u000a\u000athe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) i had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. it was always superior. \u000a\u000athis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \u000a\u000apastries - they all looked amazing. i had a plain donut while i waited in line. normally i don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\u000a\u000aatmosphere - this place has it exactly right. it's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. very friendly employees. just a complete home run. \u000a\u000aobviously i loved it. behind me in line for my re-up, i heard a girl behind me in line complain, "we could just go to starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. that's fine. everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, i don't blame people for being set that way. but the beautiful thing about tazza d'oro (cup of gold in italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloween.\u000a\u000atazza d'oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to pittsburgh.

Vthis place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. it offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. still ha that neighborhood feel though. i have never had food there though they offer paninis. great desserts. good espressos and okay coffee.outdoor seating. good place to study. plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.

Vthis is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. it took me far too long to come around and love tazza d'oro. a horrible ex of mine loved this place and i admit that this soured me. i regret the time i wasted not going here. the dark wood inside comforts me. the small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \u000a\u000atazza d'oro brews batdorf and bronson beans (amazing), provides enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs i've ever met (amazing). everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \u000a\u000athey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but i have never actually eaten it. the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia, wa. i talked about this with one of the barristas at td'o and they were offended - "we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different." sorry, tazza d'oro, you are better. \u000a\u000athe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. there's a sense of community nestled here, just off the "main drag" of highland park, between bryant st. and the reservoir. this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. the percentage of students is low. like the rest of pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally i see people i like and miss, which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me.

Vdo you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  i am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  i am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  it is 11:30 on a monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.\u000a\u000ait is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.\u000a\u000aenrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.\u000a\u000aother reasons to love this place (i know some of the other reviews highlighted these but i thought they were worth repeating).\u000a\u000a- free wifi\u000a- outside tables\u000a- tasty treats\u000a- they have a blog!\u000a- really great coffee\u000a- the staff are coffee experts

Valthough i am not a coffee drinker, i do love their iced mochas!  they have wonderful teas, cider, hot chocolate.  the servers are wonderful and the brownies, as big as your head, are like crack.  amy, the owner, has created a wonderful place for community.

Vtazza d'oro has a generally european decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. the espresso is, bar none, the best i've had - including my admittedly limited travels in italy. it's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\u000a\u000athe coffee is also terrific, and tazza d'oro uses batdorf & bronson beans - the best i've ever had for home grinding. they have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\u000a\u000ain addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; i'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends i've tried were all memorably flavorful.\u000a\u000aall that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. no one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.

Vbest independent coffeeshop i've ever had the pleasure to visit.\u000a\u000abest americano i've ever had.  some of the best espresso i've ever had.  great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  good food.  the employees are awesome.\u000a\u000athe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  the shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.

Vdelicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste, but really tasty flavors and spices. we went for all-you-can-eat wings night but sadly i could barely finish my first dozen. beer selection is much improved since  turadg a.'s post; they have about 30 or so available to choose from.

Vthe main reasons to go to buffalo blues would be for their all you can eat ribs night every tuesday for $21 and their all you can eat wings night every wednesday for $9.  make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  you have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  i once went to ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a buffalo chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\u000a\u000aanyways.  the food itself.  the ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  i tend to just go medium, b/c i find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when i eat ribs i care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  the ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  the most i've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because i didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\u000a\u000apersonally i prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  they have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are buffalo blue, old yeller, and red hot parm.  buffalo blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, old yeller is a carolina mustard based sauce, and red hot parm is a traditional buffalo sauce (frank's red hot + butter) then topped with parmesan cheese.  their cool ranch, garlic parm, and spicy garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, i kind of like their spicy garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  their gold rush and death row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but i prefer buffalo blue to both of them.\u000a\u000afor their spicy flavors, there's red hot, which is just a traditional buffalo, there's howlin' wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's hotter than hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  personally i find howlin' wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  i tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so i'm not big on hotter than hell.\u000a\u000aif i have a big appetite i eat from 24-30 wings.  if its just a regular day i'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\u000a\u000anote: these wings are huge.  they aren't your typical wingzone or quaker steak and lube sized wings.  these are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\u000a\u000athe rest of the menu is just typical american restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\u000a\u000ahighly highly recommended.

Vliving down the street of buffalo blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  the huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  for any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good.\u000a\u000athe bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  it's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  but, while they have a good number of hd tvs, only two are broadcast in hd so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.

Vin the last week i've been here twice, partially because i don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! it's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\u000a\u000ai tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than sharp edge's. the sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. to wash it down i had loose cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\u000a\u000aour waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. who makes a new girl work on a friday night! she seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because i wasn't hungry anymore so i didn't care.\u000a\u000athe beer was pricy - tuesday night i had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...

Vthe front serves as a good pittsburgh sports bar. it's a particularly great place to watch the penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. there are lots of hdtv's and there is a good selection of beer. \u000a\u000athe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. i would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.

Vi've been here quite a few times, and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt. they have a ton of nice hdtvs.\u000a\u000aeverytime i go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that i get. i was just there for the pitt/oakland game and got a redhook. i drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\u000a\u000athe food is hit or miss. i got the french onion soup last time. it was good. nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. i've had the pork nachos and they were blah.

Vi found buffalo blues to be merely ok.  i thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  i actually liked the wing sauces i tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \u000a\u000ai would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  for $10 i would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was ok.\u000a\u000asurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  a vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

Vtried this place to get my charred meat on before a steelers game, and was not disappointed.  boneless buffalo wings are my loovveeeeeeeee so i'm pretty easy to please there, and i was super happy that they allow you to order them in a small portion (5 wings).  i tried a medium spicy sauce (instead of jumping right to hotter 'n hell) because i was sick with anticipation for the steelers game, and it was nice and sweet and not bland.  \u000a\u000apredicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, i had a salad.  i expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!  the lettuce was not all nearly white grossness, the other veggies were nice and crisp, and the toppings were great!  i loovveeed the shredded chicken that didn't have a bunch of gross grease all over it.

Vwednesday is wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. for ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. if you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\u000a\u000ai've mostly had the wings at blues & i like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (especially if her name is meg).

Vchina garden appears to be your run of the mill chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but i was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  we had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  i'd easily say this is the best chinese takeout place i've found since i've been in pittsburgh (about a year).  highly recommend it.

Vi've said it before, and i'll say it again, i love me a buffet.\u000a\u000aan excellent price for some good food never hurts.  all the usual chinese fare is on the buffet with that american flare added for some spice...i suppose it would be to spice it up...  anyway  i got to taste all my favorite chinese foods from general tso's to cheese won tons.  just in case i didn't want to overdose on chinese i decided to try some of the mac n' cheese and fried potatoes (although i admit i added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).  \u000a\u000aservers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.  \u000a\u000ai would have given five stars, but as my friend pointed out while we were there, our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  next time i'll go with the soda i suppose.

Vthis is my go-to place for curing a hangover. i don't know what it is about chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. i also like to come here before i go grocery shopping at the nearby trader joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\u000a\u000aall of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, i haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. another thing i miss is creamed spinach... i have yet to see this dish on a pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among chines buffets.\u000a\u000aanother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.

Vthe hot and sour soup was ok. everything else was basically inedible. water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. more than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be "krab", considering the price of the buffet. no pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.

Vthe food here is good but it is not exceptional. \u000a\u000a i've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. there is the typical asian fare such as general tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. there is also american macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \u000a\u000awhen i go to china garden, i always request a carry out container as i find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. one thing for sure is that china garden gets plenty of customers.\u000a\u000adefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!

Vjust ate there, right next to gamestop & google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. at the end of the meal i was just eating onions with rice, though i hear this is healthy for you. counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, "have a nice day" #awkward. i know that english isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (i usually get this feeling eating asian). this is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (side note: food is very clean. brushed my teeth an hour before w/ tom's of maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)

Vthe location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food. i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon. they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. i won't go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok. they didn't give any sauce. you have to ask for it. that sucks.

Vthis is my 2nd time here and i thought that i attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact i was sooooo hungry. well my 2nd time and for a chinese buffet, this place is fantastic. the restaurant itself is very clean. the buffet is also very clean and even though i showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. the amount of choice is less than just about all the chinese buffets that i have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. all the patrons here are american, so this isn't the asian place where the asians eat. it's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. i would certainly return. giving it 7.5 knuckles out of 11.

Vthis is an average chinese buffet. the food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap american food. the food was a little too greasy even by american chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after i left that place. to me, that's a no-go signal.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.

Vi think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... the chicken is quality meat and its lightly sauted but the sauce is to blah. it's a nice place to sit down and have chinese food if you have no other local options.  \u000a\u000ait's my last resort for chinese food in the area. prices are absurd!!!

Vi ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  the pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy, sauce was good.  i should have ordered the large instead of the medium. i would definitely order from here again.

Vworst pizza i've had in pittsburgh. i ordered from here last weekend. the pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. the buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily i had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \u000a\u000amaybe it was one bad night, and i can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, i can't recommend this place to anyone.

Vahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 pm, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. i got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. the pizza was decent. there was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. i felt sick before i got halfway through it. that reminds me - the slices are huge, and are $2. the onion rings were extremely basic - i gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\u000aone irritating thing i overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like "we don't have those anymore" or "no, we can't cook wings dry." sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.

Vi had some pizza from pizza parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  a colleague brought it in, so i didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  i had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  it was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  i was starving so i really enjoyed it, but i think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, i'd say go for it.  just don't have very high expectations.

Vpizza parma has many of the characteristics i like in a pizza joint. \u000a1) they deliver when they say they will, \u000a2) diverse menu and toppings, \u000a3) coupons, \u000a4) online ordering, and \u000a5) take credit cards. \u000a\u000ai think pizza parma shines with their specialty pizzas. artichoke, buffalo chicken, spinach & feta, and greek pies are all delicious. i've also had some of their pasta dishes, and i can't complain. it's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. pizza parma fails on wings, though. the texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. desserts are also not worth the buy.

Vjimmy tsang's chinese restaurant is one of the old "traditional" pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always "being there."  my parents feel the same way about it.  it is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \u000a\u000ai don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed i prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that i've always wanted to try--sau la gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  perhaps i've never noticed, but i don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  it was good, but hoo-boy did i have to pace myself while eating it.  and have plenty of water nearby!  sau la gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and i doubt i'll have it again.\u000a\u000amy friend maryann tried  ching za gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  i sampled it and perhaps i will order that for myself next time.  i'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \u000a\u000amore to my tastes however are the garden chicken, chicken with broccoli, or beef with pea pods.  seafood dishes include sweet and sour shrimp and  sauteed shrimp szechaun style.  yeah, i'm a little unimaginative when it comes to chinese food, but i know what i like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\u000a\u000ajimmy tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  the place also does korean barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.

Vyou can see their second bar through the front windows.  i always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\u000a\u000ain other words, this place is *huge* inside.  the place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; i like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \u000a\u000achinese and korean food, at or above my expectations.  the stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.

Vi happen to stumble upon jimmy tsang's while up in pittsburgh visiting. i must say, the food is really good. the service was great - but i only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out. we liked it so much, we got take out for my family 2 nights later. \u000a\u000athe woman that runs the front is very nice / sociable and likes to talk about each dish. she has great suggestions for your taste. her husband is the chef (they are both from korea) and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years. if you like chinese food, you will love this place. it also has two cool bars inside. \u000a\u000ai highly recommend this place. the reason why i give it 4 stars is because we got take out - not sure how table service is, but i'm sure it would be good with the nice people working there.... \u000a\u000aa must try! i bet it would be a cool first date kind of place....

Vwalking into jimmy tsang's was like walking into the chinese restaurant that was on hawaii five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\u000a\u000ahot & sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\u000awonton soup was a very large portion and good.\u000a\u000aegg rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\u000acheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\u000achinese flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\u000aflaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\u000a\u000atea tasted like american lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\u000a\u000athe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.

Vi really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  first, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  i'm writing this review after going there twice.  the first time my husband and i went, the dinner was good.  we thought this place has the potential to be our go-to chinese restaurant in pgh.  today i remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  the won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  the entree was fine.  \u000a\u000awhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  the smell wouldn't leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as i could) to get rid of the smell.  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \u000a\u000a[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]

Vhey, jimmy! cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! the early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\u000ai had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). i'm going to avoid this place until i get a craving to drink tobacco.

Vi was expecting a lot more from jt but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way. it merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. the idea was cute. they even have typical chinese lunch specials.\u000a\u000athe deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. \u000a\u000ai had a craving for comfort food and ordered jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. the tea and water was served as i sat down. i went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. the calamari came out promptly and the jajangmyeon took a little longer. the portions were huge! \u000a\u000awhat took the longest and annoyed me the most (i was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes? they never came the clear the table or walked by so that i could signal that i needed the check. i should have just walked out. the food was okay but i seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn't help with. you may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break.

Vthis place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  now...  not so much.  well, during hh, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  selection by the glass is limited.  \u000a\u000aas for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  i haven't really been disappointed yet!  the appetizers/small plates all pretty good, i really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  the salads are good and although i haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, i hear great things from my friends.  the entrees are always excellent - i usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  the signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  the desserts are ok, personally, i feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \u000a\u000aoh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  and it is nice that you can order veuve cliquot by the glass ($16).\u000a\u000aprices are a bit high for what you'd expect for pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, i would recommend it.\u000a\u000ap.s. i have heard that they have a great brunch on sundays. i personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments i hear, it's probably worth the try!\u000a\u000a-------------------------\u000aupdate 12/9/07:  went to the brunch.  what a great deal!  for $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  they have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  the smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  the truffled potato was yummy.  the arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  and for entree, we both got the casbah benedict.  i have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  i think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!

Vwell it's official shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  damn you big burrito group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  i was here last night and on a monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  the space itself is beautiful.  you  enter from s. highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  there is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  the design is contemporary.  the bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  the one thing i dislike about the bar area is that the "stools" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your "neighbor" is pre-determined.  i also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  the wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  the hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  the server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  we ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and i guess in line with what others charge.  we were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta i think.  the tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but i guess it's what i should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  the bread was great.  it was warm really hearty bread that was wheat i think, definitely not white.  it was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  really good start.  we then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  i'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  it also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  the only thing i was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  however, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  we also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  the pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  the sauce and lamb were amazing.  this would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  the only detraction i'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  we also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  by the time we got to this i think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  this is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  but, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  i tried the elysian fields lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  this was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  i actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  the bartenders are good, especially fionaoverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.

Vthe food here is pretty good.  comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  the lamb is definitely good.  and it is definitely a good date restaurant.  i would rather give it 3.5 stars since i've definitely eaten at better restaurants. but for pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.

Vi went to casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. they use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. i had the house made granola which was just amazing! toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. after the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a bellini and a cup of coffee, i had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag ("the rest" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\u000a\u000amy only complaint would be how long everything took. while i love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. i go into brunch groggy, then i have coffee and yummy food, and i'm totally amped, ready to face the day! and then i get to sit. and wait. anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now i'll know to make time the next time i go. which is for dinner for a friends birthday. so excited!!

Vcan be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  we had a cheese tasting simply because i *never* pass up pleasant ridge reserve when given the opportunity.  they also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from cypress grove.  nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  i had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  the feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  i spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\u000a\u000aservice was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.

Vafter a long day of recruiting at cmu, i arranged a dinner for 16 people here in casbah... prefix menu, over all the experience was ok.\u000a\u000abreak down:\u000ascallops - appetizer - i had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  \u000afillet mignon - entree - very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the silicon valley or even some of the chain steak places like morton's.\u000adessert - the highlight of the of the meal.  mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  it was amazing.  the consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  it wasn't too dense or too liquidy.\u000a\u000abeing a big burrito restaurant, i expected more but it was good nonetheless.

Vso i went back to casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. the granola i had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. the service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. definitely go for brunch! but it's not worth the money for dinner. mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food...

Vi'm not sure why this place is called casbah.  casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.\u000a\u000athat aside, good food and great service.  definitely a place to impress.  i especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although casbah is not doing the whole "locavore" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  so, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.\u000a\u000awe started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  but the calamari was meaty and perfectly fried.  i actually had to stop because i was feeling ill from eating too many of them.\u000a\u000awe all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  quite sizeable too, given the setting.  finally, i had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (i have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  which was quite good.  i actually would have preferred it over linguine, i think, but whatever.  it was deelish.\u000a\u000anot sure why i'm not giving this place five stars.  i really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a wow experience.  better luck next time perhaps.

Vanother great big burrito restaurant, casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\u000a\u000athe three dinning rooms, "outside," inside and downstairs.  while downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  perfect for a larger group of people.  outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\u000a\u000athe food is mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. the hummus here was actually the first hummus that i had ever had and i am sorry to say it is what i compare all other to, few match up.\u000a\u000athe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to soba.  if you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, casbah is it.

Vpros: vegan food in pittsburgh?  yes!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor\u000a\u000acons: not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me\u000a\u000ahi, i am a non-drinker and rarely have i found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  granted, quiet storm like many pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  ginger lemonade?  yes.  all these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  yeah!\u000a\u000ai do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but i attribute that to my love of meaty things).  they used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but i think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  too bad most of pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.\u000a\u000ausually good music acts here.  although the few times i was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group i dragged along and the band's friends.  usually 2-3 acts play.  live.  and it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  and be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  \u000a\u000athe bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.\u000a\u000ai have never been here during the daytime so i can't comment on that.  always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  there are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.

Vthough i didn't get a chance to visit this place when i visited last month, i really do love quiet storm and i will be sure i hit it up next time i'm in town visiting my friends there. the decor is adorable. the prices are reasonable. it was an intimate place to see a show and it's too bad they are no longer doing them here. i really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart pittsburgh. it's truly a unique space.

Vi used to live about four blocks from the quiet storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and i would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to quiet storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  and then usually i'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  but i'm sorry, what is it i'm reviewing here?\u000a\u000athe quiet storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble i've ever had.  i'm an accomplished vegan eater (i get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), i've had the best scrambles new york and san francisco have to offer.  believe you me, quiet storm tops them all.  i wish i knew their secret recipe, but the part i do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  come in on a lazy sunday morning, get the nothin' fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  on top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  plus, sandwiches!  get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.\u000a\u000aand and, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  get there early.

Vi like the quiet storm because it offers food as well as drinks.  the spinach artichoke dip and white pita pizza is good.  i never had a chai milkshake until i went to the quiet storm.  if you can deal with east end "urbanites" then i would suggest trying it out, if nothing for a good laugh and decent food.

Vi moved to pittsburgh for the tempeh reuben at quiet storm.  actually, i'm lying.  or maybe not.  am i trying to save face because i don't want to admit that i moved across the country for a sandwich?  you'll never know because i'm not telling.\u000a\u000aanyway, the food here is pretty good.  sometimes it's better than others, though i think it depends on the cooks.  i'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies, right?), so i like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  i'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base, too.  the menu is creative, and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops, which i appreciate.  \u000a\u000athe atmosphere is nice here: big, open space, yet cozy.  and you won't find a radder floor in pittsburgh.  the employees are super nice.

Vit's all about the black & gold. (only on the brunch menu now, though!)\u000a\u000aand the tofu tenders.\u000a\u000aand the vegan baked goods from my goodies.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is regarding the vegan milkshakes. sorbet does not a milkshake make.

Vwondering where the pittsburgh hipster crowd hangs out? look no further than the fixie parked outside the quiet storm. \u000a\u000aand then go inside and have some delicious food and drink.

Vi looove quiet storm! it's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient atm's around, the closest business is a mcdonald's half a mile away. and i still go there every chance i get. \u000a\u000ahipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is really child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). but generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.\u000a\u000athe menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!\u000a\u000aa lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. but my favorite are their dinner salads. they're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. and their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.\u000a\u000aoh, and the drink menu! i'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so i haven't tried too much on it. but everything looks amazing. quiet storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well!

Vthis place is cool!  but it is also 'cool'.  service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  and i'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. the menu is also huge.  \u000a\u000afor those of you looking for an atm- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.\u000a\u000ai could always find a table and spread out with my books. comfy, young, hip, worth it.  i wish they had alcohol.\u000a\u000atry it!

Vit's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  the coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  generally, i wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you might catch a lucky break and be there on a good day.

Vfood is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. location is inconvenient and i would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of penn. service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. i can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\u000a\u000a**************\u000aokay i won't change my rating, but i take back what i said about the food. they have changed the menu and it is really bad. \u000a\u000awe had buffalo tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \u000a\u000ai had the thai peanut tofu wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \u000a\u000ai don't understand the point of mockamole? it's made with peas instead of avocado. \u000a\u000ahow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \u000a\u000ai would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \u000a\u000aokay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. i was completely disappointed.

Vi've tried to give this mcdonalds a chance but my patience has run out. the only reason why i came here as much as i did is because i like the $1 iced coffees. but it's not even worth it. this mcdonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \u000a\u000awhenever i want to go through the drive-thru i can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. and even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. so most of the time i just park and go inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000atoday was a horrible day. i ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. it only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. i waited 10 minutes!! sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! it's not like i ordered a meal! during that time i saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! wth?! i told the petite sleepy eyed cashier i wanted my money back! her eyes opened wide in surprise, like i really woke her up or something. she said,"youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? i can get it for you!" for real? she was the one who took my order! i told her i waited too long and i just want my money back. the manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  i refused because i had just had enough.\u000a\u000athere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. there is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. it looks like none of them want to be there. i used to work in fast food and i know it sucks, but come on!\u000a\u000ai'm sorry but i can't recommend this mcdonalds. it's poo. i'm not coming back here anymore. guess i'll be going to starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!

Vit's your typical chain craft store.  and let me reiterate that i'm not a crafts person. i walked in because i needed dial rods for some signs i had. now for being a chain store i was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection, the amounts they had for each one i wanted were scarce.  imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief.  and for a piece of wood, the price was a bit steep.\u000a\u000ai will provably come back here, but only for an item that i cannot find elsewhere. or if i'm too lazy to drive further out.

Vi come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies. whatever michaels doesn't have i just order online from a different retailer. some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals. if you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items. customer service is average. my favorite time to visit michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and halloween items are set out. since i come here often, i know where everything i need is. however, the store could use a new layout.

Vah, steak n shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. you're faster (and cheaper!) than eat n park. plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. granted, if we were at a fancy party, i might act like i don't know you, but deep down inside you know i heart you.

Vi should have known better than to stop here, but i was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  i should kick myself for thinking of this place.\u000a\u000agranted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  the sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i hadn't paid already.  \u000a\u000awhile sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  what disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  what disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  i mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  after witnessing this my food was finally ready and i drove away.\u000a\u000awhen i finally got to eating my food i was underwhelmed.  the fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  the "steakburger" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the bbq sauce on it.  it was all i could taste.\u000a\u000aall this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.

Vin my opinion, sing sing is really not worth it. it gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. i wasn't really into it when i first got there but as the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place. i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. but again, that's just me.\u000a\u000athe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the rock bottom brews they serve.

V3.5 rounding down. its been a while since jb and i ate here and i would consider going back but we just haven't gotten around to it. the beer selection looked great but the first 3 beers that i wanted "hadn't come in yet" (they were in the middle of expanding their offerings, this really bothers me...if you don't have the product, don't put it on the menu).\u000a\u000aits not necessarily vegetarian friendly, i got a pizza and it was good, not fantastic, only good. justin was satisfied with his meal. its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way.

Vthere's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  we were there on a pens playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  our orders were somewhat mixed up.  the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  i tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  the crust was delicious and homemade.  if you are going to order something, i would go with the pizza.  we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  if you are looking for good food, homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front.

Vbecause i have significantly younger sisters, i go to dave and busters about twice a year. it's fun for them and nostalgic for me. it can get expensive and the 'prizes' are cheap but it make for great "sister days" \u000a\u000aas for the food, we've eaten there once and never again. it's just blah... frozen and fried. the veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. a frozen boca patty thrown on a bun. thanks! i could have ran to costco for that. drinks are rather expensive but that's to be expected. \u000a\u000aso go for the games, fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street).

Vchuckie cheese for grown ups...yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but i'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\u000a\u000afirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a dave & buster's.  second, i actually experience all of it while here.  we will start with the food/service.  staff, you were wonderful.  you were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  food, you were not wonderful.  i ordered the bbq chicken breasts.  this came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  the chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  there were actually some bites that all i could taste was charred meat.  there wasn't enough bbq sauce on the the chicken either.  the broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  also i noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  the mashed potatoes i wanted to like (which i hoped would be the best part of the dish, i'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, i was let down. *sad face* they were cold and such a tiny portion.  with a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  oh food, how if i didn't need you to survive, i wouldn't complain about you.\u000a\u000athe building right now is in disarray.  they are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  no bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  if you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\u000a\u000aspeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  with the meal i ordered i got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  the game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  the carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  one good thing is the games.  they change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  who knew that playing connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter skee ball rises to the top of my list to play.\u000a\u000ai will return again, but only after i eat elsewhere first.

Vmicrobrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer i would have drank otherwise.  one waitress i had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as "kind of like coors light".  if i wanted coors, i'll pay half as much and have one.  \u000a\u000athe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  head next door to sing sing for drinks, though.

Vnobody has reviewed this in a while, but i am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  my husband and i ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.\u000a\u000awe started with drinks--he got the house-brewed portland wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and i got a mixed drink (red rock) that was also tasty.  \u000a\u000ahe got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and i got a mahi sandwich.  both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  there were tons of things on the menu that i'm looking forward to trying.\u000a\u000awe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\u000a\u000aour food and service was great.  they had the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  seriously, what's not to like!?  i'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)

Vhere's the trick to enjoying a meal at rock bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  stick with the sandwiches, salads, burgers, and bar food; and you'll be ok.  i've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  also, i've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  join the mug club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  thursdays are trivia nights and the dj is playing the music loud, so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :)

Vnothing special. just like applebee's, chili's or fridays. stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \u000a\u000athis was our second attempt at trying rock bottom on fathers day. the first time almost ten years ago. we went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. how do you do that on fathers day?! this time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\u000a\u000amy wife got and loved the berry bash sangria. she just said it had too much ice in it. our daughter got the root beer float which she love and i started with a mango ice tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\u000a\u000awe started off the the kobe beef sliders as our app. it took at least 15 minutes to get them. you get three sliders and they were very good.\u000a\u000amy wife got a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. she complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\u000a\u000aour daughter got the kids burger and fries. no surprise there.\u000a\u000ai ordered the new york strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. my strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. the green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \u000a\u000athe kitchen sounded like an live episode of hell's kitchen. the waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. the kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\u000a\u000aon a different note, our waitress susan was very good. come here for drinks and the bar food. skip everything else.

Vthis is the best giant eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in bay area. here's why:\u000a\u000a1. they sell beer!\u000a2. huuuuuge produce selection\u000a3. natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\u000a4. long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\u000a5. functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (i am still loyal to allegro hearth though)\u000a\u000athe store is huge and i haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, dvd rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \u000a\u000ait seems as this ge just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.

Vas far as ge's go, this location is great. it has basically everything you need and is well organized. you can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other ge stores. they also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. i would venture to say this is better than the market district.

Vwaterfront geagle is my primary market. now that they've expanded and reorganized, i rarely even have to set foot in target anymore. yippie! there's a wine kiosk (suck it pa liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. they usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as market district. i do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, i suppose.

Vi don't know why, but i just can't like this location very much.  i lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another ge before this one.  maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\u000a\u000athe selection is typical for any ge, broad and expansive.  some prices are a bit steep.  \u000a\u000athis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.

Vbarnes & noble, it's like the wal-mart of bookstores.  beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \u000a\u000ai'm not quite sure whether i'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a cd shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  with all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\u000a\u000ai don't know about y'all, but i'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.

Vi stopped here yesterday with rob and matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing "the hangover" at loews across the street.  incidentally, "the hangover" is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  there are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  it's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  we sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  i ordered a guinness as usual, rob ordered a long island iced tea and matt had a miller light.  make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  i sampled rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  the next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  the bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  i don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  we ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  we started with the chips and salsa.  the chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  i tried one it was okay i guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  he asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  this pretty much sums up my experiences at the bar louie's i've been too.  they kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  maybe i'm being too critical... i tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... so, i settled on the hummus appetizer.  this was surprisingly pretty good.  the pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  it's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  matt had the hot wings which i tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  all in all this place isn't that bad.  if you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.

Vservice has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\u000a\u000athings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good i could eat it with a spoon)

Vi'm not into waterparks as much as i am into amusement parks.  i go to sandcastle maybe once a year.  but my chicago friend catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  the main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the sandbar and the sandbar pool and the hot tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  the sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  occasionally there's live entertainment.\u000a\u000ait's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby homestead works.  but after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  the view across the mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  there's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\u000a\u000ai'm glad i renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, i'll get another chance to come back.

Vthe only place to buy a mattress.\u000a\u000aboth my wife and i and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so i decided to check this place out. we went on a sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. lee greeted us and showed us around the store. they offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. we found her a great mattress at a great price. while waking around the store my wife found a serta icomfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. \u000a\u000alee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through wells fargo bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! i went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but i bought us a new one as well. no one can beat their prices! i compared the price of our new mattress to levin, macy's and mattress discounters. no one came close to the price we got at american buyers. everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.\u000a \u000atake it from me, when it comes to your sleep, do not buy a cheap mattress!!! we bought a cheap, supposed serta mattress in 2008 from mattress discounters. the boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. i don't think i will have that problem again as our new serta has a full 25 year warranty. \u000a\u000aa couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. the delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.\u000a\u000ai highly recommend american buyers discount mattress for all of your bedding needs.

Vmy friend and i have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. for a thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. there were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. we ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). i was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. i even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. this wasn't bad for a first visit so i will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. i'm only giving uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. hello! the plate was yellow! how could she not have seen that?!

Vour go to place at the waterfront. \u000a\u000awe usually order the crispy green beans as an app., they are always fried just right and never really greasy. as an entree i always get coconut curry tofu, the veggies are bright and crisp (no open pea pods or limp broccoli!) and the tofu is simply delightful. \u000a\u000aalways consistent. never disappointing

Vour last few visits have left something to desire, one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. these people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\u000a\u000athe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (hint, hint) so we left and most likely will not be returning.

Vi've heard it's very much a chain and that it's not at all authentic chinese food, however despite all that i have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent.  there is quite a disconnect with the loud rock music played in the dining room and the serene chinese decor, but i figure it works for somebody!  i ordered the ginger chicken with broccoli and the meal was quite tasty.  the prices are quite reasonable.  just as long as you are not looking for authentic chinese dishes, this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch.

Vthis is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area. friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free wifi! try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.

Vhad lunch here after getting my nails done in the waterfront.  it's your standard panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  our food was made very quickly, even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a saturday).  chicken noodle soup is tasty, but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  i tried their sierra chicken sandwich for the first time, and it was pretty good.  it's very flavorful, i like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  it was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.\u000a\u000aif i have to get a quick, light meal and only chain options are available, panera is my best choice.  it's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  but there isn't much special about it, of course.

Vthis use to be my go to panera bread.  when i worked in the area i would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  i was happy when i left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  my waist also appreciated it.  those scones are delicious.\u000a\u000ai recently stopped back here when i was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  with all my new allergies i came in here hoping to get some bread.  not knowing, nor doing my homework before i showed up, i asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  after looking through it for a few minutes i was able to select the bread i wanted.  they will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  if you would rather slice yourself, i am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  but it is much better tasting.

Vwhat can i say, i'm a shill for target!  like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!\u000a\u000abut as for the name brands here, i've never had a problem with them.  i bought some woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and i have been very satisfied with.  the housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  my husband rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  he particularly likes the michael graves ones.  he is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.\u000a\u000ame, i also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  i've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here.

Voh target!  you are big corporate america!  but how can i not love you so?  your prices are the best whenever i need household goods like detergents, cleaners, etc.  for personal effects such as toiletries, soap, etc, you can't be beat!  your cookware and bakeware department is every bit as good as macy's!\u000a\u000aand i see you have the retro tees too.  you know:  yes http://www.dovenetq.net.au/~mahayes/graphics/yeslogofullcircle1.jpg boston http://www.vinylrecords.ch/b/bo/boston/boston/boston-63.jpg led zeppelin http://henrikfalck.com/blog/uploaded_images/ledzeppelinledzeppelinalbumcover-716782.jpg  we know what "retro tee" means:  faux aged, catering to boomers and teens, and costing way more than they origianlly did.  oh and made in china of course!

Vafter working for the rival of target for years, target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at.  although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores i'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.  \u000a\u000adepending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.  if you don't mind walking a bit, the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store.\u000a\u000athe only downside i can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  i prefer not to vomit as soon as i walk into a store, maybe after about ten minutes in i'd consider it.

Vi've been to many targets and they're all the same. however, this particular one is currently being remodeled. children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. there is a new starbucks that is now open. the cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve pizza hut pizza and other new menu items. the area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section. basically, this target in homestead will eventually look like the one in east liberty. i like this target, so i am pleased with the new changes (especially starbucks)!

Vi head straight back to the clearance! that's where you'll find the best deals. you will be able to see your savings when you check out because it's calculated on your receipt. im a huge proponent of going after summer and winter seasons to stock up for next year - boots, galoshes and sandals never go out of style.

Vbasically after being sent here after not having the item at another location, i walk in and go to the exact spot that the item is suppose to be.  and yet again, the exact one is not on the shelf.\u000a\u000afrustrated, i walk to the customer service desk and ask whether or not they have it.  which the response i got was to basically look on the shelf.  after i told them i did that already, one of the employees had an ingenious idea.  instead of checking the kitchen part of the store, why not check the bath part.  what do you know, that's where it was.\u000a\u000aso that just makes me think that they had this item at the other store, but just weren't in tune with knowing that the item was located in another part of the store.\u000a\u000aeverything after that was a smooth ride.  wedding registry updated, purchased, and gift wrapped.  yes, these places have an area that you can gift wrap for free.  it says it's a do it  yourself area, but for some reason an employee did mine for free.  only downside is that some of the gift wrapping that some of the wrapping items have the store name on it, which might look a bit tacky.

Vdecent size, decent selection, decent staff.\u000a\u000ai guess that can wholly sum this place up, it's decent.  as with many other stores that are like this, the product rotates depending on what doesn't sale well at other stores.  can always snag a deal here.  i was able to pick up a pretty sweet puma jacket for $10, can't beat that, right?\u000a\u000athat being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well.  so really don't get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item.

Vwent in here to grab a last minute item i needed for an outfit.  i wasn't going to hold my breath here either, i know it's a marshalls and that doesn't always mean the best selection.  it's hit or miss no matter what you are looking for.\u000a\u000athis day, was a hit, maybe even a home run.  i do have to admit, the kenneth cole shirt i got not only looked great on me, but made my wallet feel even better!

Vfinally, i restaurant in pittsburgh that i can give 4 stars!! mitchell's is located on the waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. the interior is a classic, clean, modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood, glass, etc... the menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  but here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get "small plates" at the bar for $3 each, and these ain't no costco fish sticks! two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough french bread they bring out). finally, while the drinks aren't cheap, they're creative, tasty and fresh. all in all, i had a great experience, and i think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.

Vmitchell's fish market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  and actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  the atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  it wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a friday around 7:30 pm.\u000a\u000aour server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  i started with a house salad, which i told the server i would split with my boyfriend.  she brought it to us on two separate plates, which i thought was a nice touch, and more than what i expected.  poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as i remember, but tasty.\u000a\u000ai ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  my entree was a combo: lobster tail, and "lobster pot pie."  now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but i have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  it wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as i like (i'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  it's just a shame.  dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\u000a\u000athe lobster pot pie was totes not what i imagined.  i pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  instead....i got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  there was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (i'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  whaaaaaaaat?  it wasn't bad or anything, but not what i imagined.  i was a little bummed out.  \u000a\u000aso everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but i think in future i'd rather just head to the strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  i didn't try their fresh preparations, so i can't say how those were.\u000a\u000ai'd say in the waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  and the atmosphere is great, including the service.

Vi have eaten some very good dinners here.  although it's a chain, i would say it's several notches above the other chain restaurants.  the chef here seems to add some creativity to the menu, so i will be definitely back again soon.

Vi'm not too impressed with this particular dick's sporting goods. it is in a great location in the waterfront, but the selection seems a bit limited to me. they have what you need, but they don't have many options it seems.\u000a\u000ai went in there the other day and it looks like they also have a snowboarding section now, which they definitely did not have last season. they also have hunting, golfing and biking, in addition to the other regular deptartments. \u000a\u000ayour normal dick's. nothing spectacular, but it will do.

Vthis is the best bike store i've walked into.  their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as i'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.\u000a\u000agot greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and i got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  she explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  i wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (i'm 6'8", and as i found out, fit pretty well on an xxl scott 65cm frame.)\u000a\u000aanyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  what impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  and then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  after she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  there was no hurry.  there was no pressure.\u000a\u000athe amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.\u000a\u000aand, update: i went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike i tooled around on there two weeks ago.  without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  i talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  \u000a\u000athat said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  i asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price i expected from doing research on the internet.  \u000a\u000acustomer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  a+++.\u000a\u000a\u000aedit, 4 years later: \u000a\u000aglen, beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  my girlfriend is now my wife.  my lowend trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)\u000a\u000ait's still a much longer drive to get to big bang, but for any work on my bike, i'm glad to make the drive.  friends have terrific luck with pittsburgh pro, which is nearer,  and i'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, big bang is my absolute go-to.

Vmy mom was up from mississippi for thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. i wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (brighton heights), so i turned to trusty yelp for advice. off to star nails we went. the inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. we each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. the technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. i got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. my mom and i left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. at least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). perhaps their other services are better, but i'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.

Vwithout question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater pittsburgh region. i find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. the 50%-off sales actually pay off here. the merchandise turns over quickly. the staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. the balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. the prices are reasonable to cheap. the plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. the kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. the remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. \u000a\u000ai have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store. this is, hands-down, without question, the thing i miss most about leaving pittsburgh. this store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of h&m.

Vi can't believe i've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  i absolutely love this place.  it's a super thrift store if you will.\u000a\u000ano matter when i come here, i always find something.  it quite the experience.  i always make sure it's a day when i am off of work because i can literally spend hours here just looking.  it's a good thing that i do this, you can't just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  \u000a\u000alike a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  sometimes you just can't avoid this, i blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.\u000a\u000athey have everything you can seem to desire here.  clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  everything is under this roof.\u000a\u000a*cash only, atm on premise.

Vthis giant eagle truly is giant!  and believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  you would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\u000a\u000ayou know that a trip to a large, "one size fits all" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at macy's or boscov's.  you know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  its purpose is purely utilitarian.  but good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  it shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \u000a\u000athat's what happened to me yesterday.  i would have been better off going to cogo's or 7-11.  i might have paid a bit more, but i would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  i prefer the giant eagle in squirrel hill.

Vi cannot in my life understand why this giant eagle, of all the giant eagles, would get a five star rating.  from the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\u000a\u000athe set up is ridiculous.  i mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, surprise, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  it's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \u000a\u000ahonestly, i only went here because i was at target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.

Vthis giant eagle seems more like a getgo than an actual supermarket. as soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.\u000a\u000a you don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. for one, the prices are high. secondly, this giant eagle does not carry everything you need. who has time to run to another store? just get your basic necessities here.\u000a\u000aas for produce, it can be awful at times. whenever i go to giant eagle market district down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  however, at shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. i can go to trader joe's and find much better produce for less.\u000a\u000aa pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. there should be two lines but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. the staff rarely sorts this out.\u000athe customer service is average here and i don't expect it to get any better.\u000a\u000ai only go here if i have to grab one or two items. the best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.

Vwhen you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned, nothin' fancy italian restaurant, you can't beat minutello's!  my husband rick and i didn't feel like cooking the other night so we came here for a nice casual dinner.  man, i haven't reviewed this place in nearly three years and it sure hasn't changed.  still has that good old basement decor.\u000a\u000aminutello's still has some of the best pizza in town.  rick and i ordered the supreme wtih capicola, italian sausage, salami, and pepperoni!  mm-mm good!  gotta hit that gym tomorrow.  and you know the best thing about ordering pizza, don't you?  it's always good the second day!

Vthis was one of the worst dinners out i've had in recent memory. on the other hand, i wasn't expecting much, so i guess the place lived up to my expectations. i've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best i can come up with is as follows. imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. in other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. there was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. to be fair, i only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... it's possible, although unlikely based on what i've seen.\u000a\u000aon the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! if you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.

Vbased on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at minutellos has slipped a little bit.  still as i mentioned before, it's a shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \u000a\u000aanyway, the main reason to come to minutellos is for the pizza.  my cousin and i did just that the other night when we were in the area.  we did the whole 'build your own pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.

Vthe people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  i woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that i was the victim of a hit and run.  the damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\u000a\u000awithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  i set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\u000a\u000awhen i arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  my wait was minimal, the staff were polite and i wasn't being jerked around.  within five minutes of them looking at my car, i was out the door and heading back to my place.  \u000a\u000aunfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  but if we get to that step, i am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  if their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.\u000a\u000ayes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it.

Vthis is an animal shelter with a tremendous heart. while i realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka "no-kill") shelters around pittsburgh, the "open door" policy places the arl at the top of my list. where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the arl will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. a small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. \u000a\u000ai have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. the paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. so don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! for a quieter experience, try a weekday. for the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a steelers game. seriously, you will have the place to yourself. \u000a\u000ais it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a steelers game? whoops. \u000a\u000athe arl lists some of their pets on petfinder, but i have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what i'm trying to get at is this: don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. and don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. there are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. \u000a\u000athe staff of volunteers is extraordinary - i adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. i had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. they invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! \u000a\u000athe rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about "sales." you can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. i donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. they also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. \u000a\u000amaybe i seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts. bravo, arl, the pets & their families thank you.

Vi've had such good experiences with arl, that i will probably return here again and again.  years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that i could have ever imagined.  but let me talk about my most recent visit.\u000a\u000awhile browsing facebook, i noticed that they were having an event at arl.  this particular event was called the free fur all.  the event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.\u000a\u000ai had plans to get little man e microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  hot damn, you know i was in line.  it's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.\u000a\u000aonce we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  it's a very quick thing to have done.  little man e didn't even flinch.  he was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  i have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  they are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  it's like they talk their language.  i also have to thank them because while we were there, lme somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).\u000a\u000aonce done, we just walked outside to see what was up (e skipped the bath).  we visited one of the tables and e selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.\u000a\u000athis place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things.  i'll definitely be coming back here whenever i need something for lme.

Vi go to this cvs all the time, since i work in the neighborhood.  i'm not a huge fan of it - i go mostly due to convenience.  their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - i don't think i've ever found a decent card here.  i keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  like, razor blades.  and body wash.  body wash?  it drives me nuts that i need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  it makes no sense.  staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.\u000a\u000agood things - i love their coupon rewards.  i guess that's for all cvses, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because i get mad style coupons like every other visit.  and i had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  \u000a\u000ai'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  it just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  i would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  and they have a parking lot, if that helps you.

Vvery easy place to get my tires replaced.  i pulled in, they took a few pieces of information and i just had to wait.  while i was to wait i made sure it was ok for me to walk to nearby businesses to pick up a few items i needed.  they took my phone number and told me they would call when my car was finished.\u000a\u000awhile i was out at nearby stores my phone rang less than a hour later and was told i could come and pick up my car.  walked in, paid and away i went.\u000a\u000awhy couldn't i give this place a five star rating.  two reasons.  1.  i ordered my tires and was expecting to receive a call on a friday to stop in and have the tires put on my car, they did not call me at all and i called the following monday to find out my tires were there for the past few days and no one made the effort to call me.  2. when i left, i could not comprehend why the air pressure wasn't regulated to my new tires.  how hard was it to make sure that my psi was set to 32?  one tire was at 38 and the other at 35.  i promptly needed to visit a gas station to remedy the situation.

Vthe coffee here is amazing (i love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). the baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. while there are a number of tables, enrico's was busy even on a friday night...i would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.

Vthis is a great place for happy hour, to catch the game, or to have a small-ish private party. definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials, but mon-fri from 5-7pm they have \u000a$1 off all drafts\u000a1/2 priced blues booze\u000a$5 nachos and quesadillas\u000a$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)\u000a\u000aeast end beers are $3 all day, every day.\u000a\u000athe food here is not spectacular, but i've always enjoyed what i've gotten. being from the south, i wouldn't think to order the bbq or catfish here, so i can't vouch for those. the spicy wings, cheese sticks, salads, and grilled cheese are all good. the regulars and servers are pretty nice people. we watched the saint/steelers game here (with our saints attire on!), and easily made friends the whole night. they also have a small "loft" area that you can reserve for free for a private party, and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. finally, they deliver! i love having another delivery option besides chinese and pizza. now i can be lazy and eat a big salad!

Vmy coworkers and i had lunch here on a friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "meh" experience for me.  we were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that i didn't even know existed, so apparently buffalo blues is bigger than i thought.  it's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\u000a\u000ai went for the hot veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  the sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  the sandwich left something to be desired.  it wasn't hot, first of all - i'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  the hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  there wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  it was just belly-filler, really.  i guess that's what i get for trying to order healthy here.  \u000a\u000ai just wasn't much interested in it, and i don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  i better have a darn good sandwich if i'm paying $8.  also, it was relatively small in size - i don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  but i guess i think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that i can take half home.  buffalo blues was neither.\u000a\u000anot particularly interested in returning for any reason.

Vi have a cat, so this review is cat-centric.\u000a\u000agreat independently owned pet store.  they only carry more premium foods, so if you feed your cat fancy feast or cat chow, don't come here for that sort of thing.  also only carry the more eco-friendly cat litters - no tidy cats here!  friendly staff, and the prices are not much more than you would be paying at petco or similar places.  of course, you don't get the huge selection either, but this is my go to place for buying food, litter, and random toys.\u000a\u000ait makes me feel good to be supporting a local establishment.  try it - you might find that you like it too.

Vnot really an update so much as a plea to the yelp community. if you are needing pet supplies and live in the point breeze/shadyside/squirrel hill/east liberty area, please please consider stopping by and supporting this store. with the new petsmart (or is it petco?) open down the street where borders used to be, this independently owned store is under a lot of pressure to survive. given that the prices are not that different, please give this place a shot. i'm not super anti-chain stores, but i am pro-independent stores (does it have to be a zero-sum game?).

Vi went here a couple weeks ago to get new tires on my car. i couldn't agree more with the other reviewers. walter's was originally supposed to call me with an estimated cost, and when i hadn't heard, i called and spoke with walter directly. 15 minutes later, he had an estimate for me. when i couldn't decide on the tire i wanted, he had three different types waiting for me when i came in for my appointment & went through the pros and cons of each! just great service!\u000a\u000ai also found the price reasonable & the service was quick.

Vnamed for pittsburgh greats, gene kelly and billy strayhorn, this historic theater is a real gem.  originally the regent, built in 1914, the building was renovated in 2000 as a performing arts center for theater, dance, music and film.  i have been to several fundraisers hosted by the kelly strayhorn, and they have always been first rate.  also, i recently attended the kelly strayhorn's own fundraiser, full bloom, which was lots of fun.  as a venue, this place is definitely worth your attention, and the staff seems to bend over backward to make sure events go off without a hitch.

Vi've had a wide range of experiences here.  let's just say, when i first moved here, one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title.  it's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed.  another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too.  now i'm working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem, but even she is like "i can't believe those other people told you to do that....they made this so much harder than it needed to be."  my thoughts exactly.\u000a\u000awork with barb, if you can.  she knows her stuff.  i don't quite trust anybody else to help me properly.  also they're only open from 830-4 (or is it 430?) so you pretty much have to go before work, or on saturday.  and i will be going in tomorrow at 830 until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusion....\u000a\u000aalso, parking is free in their lot.  and if you are a aaa member, i think your fees are lower, or something like that.  i do have aaa, so it makes sense for me to come here - i can't say what the experience is like for non members.

Vit is nothing like the bars in san francisco, i don't know where you people went. i'm not enough of a scenester to appreciate shadow lounge to the fullest, i don't care for poetry slams or open mic. the night i visited, they had a live band playing an early set, it ended at 9pm. \u000a\u000ai was intrigued by the sandwiches they make on one side of the bar - whatever it was smelled amazing and no doubt smells even better after you've had a couple beers. speaking of beers, on tap selection is small - 4-5 beers and even the fridge wasn't impressing me. they do have full bar however.\u000a\u000athere was also another room with couches and big tv and another club (?) linked to shadow lounge that looked more hip-hop and danceclubby. there was no dancing going on though and the room was rather empty.

Vshadow lounge brings good music to east liberty in pittsburgh. for this, they deserve 3 stars alone.\u000a\u000ahowever, the one time i was there for a reggae concert, it was incredibly crowded, but even worse, it was impossible to get a drink at the bar. there were two bartenders trying to serve 300 people. in sum, come for the music only.

Vi love this store. i can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.\u000a\u000aall of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.\u000a\u000athey even cut keys that actually work.

Vfish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  i mean i know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\u000a\u000ai've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so i'll focus on that.  i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  each time i'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  i don't believe there was ever a time i could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  give that woman a hand.

Vi would rather drive out of my way to another home depot than give this location my business. \u000a\u000aemployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. strike that... i'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\u000a\u000ai'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. there are plenty of hd's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!

Vthe glass center is a marvelous addition the pittsburgh cultural scene.  they are a gallery, a place to take classes, a center for glass artists in residence, and much more.  whether you are taking a tour, a class, or visiting the gift shop or gallery, there's a lot to see and learn here.  i've taken tours several times with different groups, but i always learn something new and i am always impressed by the great work takes place at the center.\u000a\u000athey will take students at every level.  their facility is well run and professionally staffed.  i was delighted to meet their enthusiastic staff.\u000a\u000athere's a hot shop, a cold shop, a flame shop, and a gallery, so there's lots to see and learn.

Vi've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  i also should have known that i shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\u000a\u000ai figured i'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  i opted for the popcorn chicken salad.  sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \u000a\u000ai have to say that even though i was saying yes, my body was saying, 'oh hell no!'\u000a\u000ai'm regretting this decision now as i am sitting here in discomfort.  not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  but i'm not liking the effect i'm getting right now.  could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\u000a\u000ai'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.

Vbelieve it or not, this whole foods is actually one of the most successful ones. the location is strange, but it's pretty central for most of the yuppier areas of pittsburgh, and it's the only one in the pittsburgh area. just for that, they get 5 stars.

Vi don't know, maybe i'm not clear on the concept of whole foods.  don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at whole foods.  whole foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\u000a\u000ai have found that i can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at giant eagle for less.\u000a\u000athier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is pennsylvania.  you can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \u000a\u000ai can get just as good quality meat and produce in the strip district.  sometimes, even better quality.\u000a\u000ai guess the benefit of whole foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  i'm not slamming whole foods at all, but i actually like trader joe's better.

Vi loved whole foods in ohio.  it was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\u000a\u000ahere?  well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale suvs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (a few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  my blood pressure skyrockets the second i even try to pull in here.\u000a\u000asecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  i don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\u000a\u000athirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \u000a\u000athere are a few good points, though.  the sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  the salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  but i still try to avoid whole foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.

V3.5 stars, actually. would be 4 but i had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation. the lot sucks, i used to work at whole foods and i can not recall how many times i almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts. i am one of the lucky ones, i know of a few people who weren't so lucky. \u000a\u000ai'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. to be fair, i can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh i can't stop myself from piling it on). the prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1. \u000a\u000ai now work with a lot of children on special diets and i have no problem finding lots of gfcf treats for them here. \u000a\u000agroceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand. the wfm's 365 line is an excellent bargain. \u000a\u000athe bakery is full of tasty treats. you've gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie, though i believe it is only available around the holidays. \u000a\u000athe whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays.

Vi have a soft spot for whole foods.  i think it gets a bad rap, which i think is largely unfair.  i love food, and i know that sometimes things are legitimately "overpriced," but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  so i don't believe in rating whole foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  nice things cost money.\u000a\u000athis is not one of the glorious meccas - the whole foods in lincoln park in chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  i like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  my coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  i love that i can find really unusual things here - their asian section is small, but they always seem to have what i need.  and the prices on the whole foods store brand are really not that bad!  seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your giant eagle.  you can find affordable products here if you take the time.\u000a\u000ai wish their bulk section was bigger, and i wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  whole foods is like, where i want to do all my shopping when i grow up.  i hate shopping at giant eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  it's just crap, and overpriced crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  whole foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  there's respect for the ingredients here.  to me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.\u000a\u000aif you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  there are so many surprises here!  i just wish it was bigger.\u000a\u000aand yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?  park in the back and walk a few extra feet.  it's not a big deal.

Vi am a big fan of the whole foods company in general.  the store back home (omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a giant cheese counter where you could sample...i could go on.\u000a\u000athe pittsburgh whole foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  two-thirds of the time they are out of what i came for.  i'm sorry, but if i'm paying that much for groceries, i want a stellar shopping experience.  this wf is mediocre at best.

Vok, so this is my first visit to whole foods...ever.  and now i know why it has taken me so long.  much like the parking lot, the inside of the store is just as congested.\u000a\u000ai came here with only two things in mind that i needed, i went to the aisles i assumed they would have been in and we all know the saying there.  for as small as the store is you would have thought i would have bumped into a staff member.  i was again wrong there.  \u000a\u000ai scanned and scanned and scanned the aisles until i found the two items i needed, and wouldn't you know right after i did, i came across a staff member.  \u000a\u000aafter being run over by a stroller on my way to the registers, i was happy to head back out and fight the congestion in the parking lot.

Vi shop at whole paycheck from time to time, but i find them much too expensive for everyday groceries.  if i want to splurge once in a while, or buy something to take to a party, it's definitely the place to go.  the cheese counter is extensive, but i don't like that they pre-cut their cheeses, i much prefer the way penn mac handles their cheeses and does not cut until you order.  whole foods will gladly do the same, so make sure you request that.  i love the produce and the prepared foods.  i just wish they would give us a break on the prices.

Vmy best friend and i went here for dinner today and were very pleased - though i do have to say that we both had our free birthday entrees and that undoubtedly influenced things.  i was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.\u000a\u000awe started with two big glasses of sangria.  i thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or i got used to it.\u000a\u000ai had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  i had never had morels before and now i understand why they're so pricey.  there was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  the risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind i wish i could make myself.  my best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  i tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.\u000a\u000awe split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote happy birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  the creme brulee was good but definitely not the best i've ever had.  (that award may go to soba's coffee creme brulee.)\u000a\u000athe total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  but it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  the patio was lovely.  i will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!

Vexcellent place for brunch.  for $22, i had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  reservations available through open table.  this is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.

Vexcellent excellent brunch spot.  for review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\u000a\u000acasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  i ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  i started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  my companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\u000a\u000awhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\u000a\u000athe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  there was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  i tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\u000a\u000amy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  i love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  the braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  the best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  this dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  i tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (i think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\u000a\u000aservice was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, and they take reservations.  sometimes i don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (point brugge, coca cafe, etc.), but most times i'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

Vout of the big burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. and this is just not a one time bad experience, i have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.\u000a\u000aservice has always been good and attentive i enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or i expected much better for the money i am paying. for example:\u000a\u000asumac scallop appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is i can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant i am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.\u000a\u000arisotto - over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.\u000a\u000aduck entre, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. i even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.\u000a\u000apasta entre with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.\u000a\u000aif this was some little bistro where i was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) i wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money i expect a little more attention to detail.

Vi ate here in january and was very impressed. we ate in the basement, although casbah has two floors and outdoor seating. i thought the atmosphere was very good, and the fish (i forget the exact dish) was well-prepared.\u000a\u000athis is on the expensive side, but worth it for a special occasion.

Vi've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and i'd have to say that generally, i'm a fan.  their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  it was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\u000a\u000ai came back for dinner a month or so later.  we had reservations (on a monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  we sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, mediterranean garden.  and yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  even with my young eyes, i still needed a candle to read the menu.  but it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  a little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\u000a\u000athe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  i actually had a cocktail to start - the perfect pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  there was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  it was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors i love.  still, for the price, i think the portion was a little stingy.  when i buy an $11 cocktail, i like it to really fill the glass.  we nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - i think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  it was a bit bland - i think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\u000a\u000athings got better during the actual dinner.  i ordered the heritage farms chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  it's just squash!  but somehow, it was heavenly.  my friend enjoyed her cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  i tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  the only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  i tasted them too, and i have to say - it was off-putting.  perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\u000a\u000awe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  i didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  i enjoyed our creme brulee - because i enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \u000a\u000aoverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  i had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  but this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  i think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.

Vthis is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  we were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  i highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in pittsburgh.  the arugula salad is delicious.  so is the alaskan halibut.  you really can't go wrong with casbah.

Vfor solid veggie/vegan food in pittsburgh's east end, the qs is a reliable meat-free choice. there are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned qs diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. the scrambled tofu is a shining star. the kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. the salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad i've eaten in pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with french fries! nothing here is fried - even the "fried" foods are baked. your arteries are grateful. the kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. \u000a\u000athis used to be the place to brunch, and i'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but i had to quit when all these suv families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the qs made it into some kind of "visit pennsylvania" travel guide as a great brunch spot. i hate to be that "i liked their old stuff better" kind of a person, but, well... \u000a\u000adon't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the qs means making a special atm run. \u000a\u000athe qs is super kid-friendly. books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). the menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. i wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds i know. \u000a\u000athe drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. the espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. you may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. no liquor license but you can byob for a nominal charge. \u000a\u000athe service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. i would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. \u000a\u000aif you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too. i do wish the hours were a little different - i operate on the schedule of a late-nite diner, though.

Vwe go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. it's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). my bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  homefries with tofu instead of eggs. the waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. this establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\u000a\u000aon cold wintery days try a mexican hot chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!

Vthe quiet storm is a classic, being one of the largest selections of vegetarian and vegan entrees in the city. recently came with about 13 people for a saturday lunch. i won't speak for everyone's dish, but i got the curry which was very tasty, if not a bit skimpy on the rice and a little thin for my liking. my friend got the qhf, which is a tofu scramble mixed with home fries and seisage which was absolutely delicious. she also got a side of spicy aioli which went extremely well with the breakfast dish. the service was prompt and they just left pitchers of water on the table for us which was great. always a great choice for meat-eaters and veggie's alike. if you go with a large group though, beware because it is difficult to work in the added gratuity and tax with the cash-only. the waiter wouldn't let us split it up and take individually, so it was difficult on that end.

Vwe've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!\u000a\u000areally excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. i had the breakfast burrito, which i thought was ok, but not something i would order again. but, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, i felt like i was in the mission in sf (ok, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in ca). kid friendly too, if that's important to you.

Vordered delivery here with coworkers the other evening.\u000a\u000ai ordered an appetizer or what i thought was an appetizer.  the portion size was amazing that i had some to take home with me to snack on.  i only ordered the bread sticks, but they were amazing.  hand made, baked and topped with oil and parmesan cheese.  comes with a side of marinara sauce for dipping and i was very pleased.\u000a\u000athe reason for the three stars was the time it took for delivery.  i believe from the timed the order was called in, it took over a hour to have the food show up.  not so good.

Vafter ordering from here again i bump my rating up a star.  i've ordered their breadsticks the past two times and have been impressed.  simple breadstick with a bit of butter brushed on and sprinkled with parmesan cheese has me swooning.  the marinara sauce to dip it in is amazing as well.

Vi took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. i was very impressed by the facilities and service. the facilities are spotless & modern, and the vets seem both knowledgeable and willing to spend time with you and your animal.\u000a\u000ai was particularly impressed when i had my cat declawed. they kept her for several days to monitor my progress & called me each day to update me on her progress.\u000a\u000ait seems a bit expensive (although i have no other point of comparison) but the service is well worth it.

Vi guess i'm getting burned out on winter.  that's what made me think about this place.  see, as julina below says, it's close to frick park and it's a wonderful place to pick up sandwiches, pop, or picnic supplies before going over there.  it's also a great place to sit outside with a cup of coffee or a cold drink or snack before going over to the frick mansion.  so you can stop here with your out-of-town guests while sightseeing.\u000a\u000athis is truly a little out-of-the-way gem, located on a side street.  i haven't been up this way in awhile (i was also nosing around on google maps/street view yesterday, so that's also why i thought of this place) so i hope nothing much has changed here.

Vmy friend marla and i decided to go biking through frick park on a recent sunday.  we stopped here because it's a great place to load up on provisions before starting a ride.  i'm a diabetic, so whenever i do physical activities, i need to make sure i have some of the sweet stuff with me like an energy bar or trail mix.  \u000a\u000athe help here is very friendly.  they have a deli menu and outdoor tables, although we stopped at ruggeri's afterward.  but if you're in the neighborhood, stop by for some pop, coffee, or a deli sandwich and sit out and relax at one of their tables.

Vthere is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and frick park market fits the bill. come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. the owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\u000a\u000athe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. you can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. pittsburgh treasure!

Vit's been two years since i've last reviewed frick park market?  time to write an update!   i came here recently on my day off and had me a sammitch!  \u000a\u000awhoa, baby!  do i have to upgrade this to a five-star review or what?!!  this place knows how to do a pastrami on rye right!  to start with, they use boar's head meats here, which are some of the best deli meats around.  second of all, they size the sandwich just right.  it's not small, but it's not so ginormous that you can't finish it.  the meat is layered just perfectly on it and they don't slather on the condiments (presentation is every bit as good as taste, folks).  third, the bread tastes like it was delivered just this morning.  fourth, they top it off with a really good pickle.   finally, when you bite into it, the sandwich doesn't overpower you--instead it melts delicately in your mouth.  m-m-m-m-m, you wanna savor it.  \u000a\u000africk park market is much more than a deli though.  you can get convenience foods, milk, ice cream, etc, here.  as i mentioned before, it's a great place to stock up on snacks if you're going hiking in nearby frick park.  and as joseph said, the owner is happy to talk to you.  frick park market is a small neighborhood treasure.

Von our way back from dc to chicago yesterday, we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. one of the best co-ops i have ever been to. they have such a huge selection of products. if you are looking for vegan cheese, this place has a humongous selection including sheese, which my bud says is really hard to find. they carry my beloved temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. nummers! i grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by najat's cuisine, a still warm ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and i'm sure i am forgetting something. i would come here all the time if i lived in pittsburgh. their hot food looked good, but i wanted something to grab and go.\u000a\u000afunny thing, in the time that we were there, three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. then the cashier said he liked my obama button. i love this place!

Vspices, spices, spices! best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at giant eagle. i also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products, eggs, bread (allegro hearth, yum!) , and honey. one gripe - salad mix, it's 4.99 a bag! you can get the same salad mix at tj's for 1.99, 2.99 if you want organic. and currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. i don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great.

Vthe bulk sections are amazing!!! spices, grains, oils, nut butters, pastas, the list goes on & on. if you or someone you know is on a special diet, this is place to go. they have a great selection of produce, gfcf items, vegan/vegetarian, and a good meat selection for that carnivore close to your heart (all the meat is hormone free and the animals fed vegetarian diets), the hot bar/salad bar (of course you pay by the pound so it can get pricey as everything looks so delicious) and prepackaged sides & sandwiches make for a fantastic lunch or quick dinner. i go there 5 days a week for the soup alone.

Vthis place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.  \u000a\u000ait's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  it's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when giant eagle's selection looks beat up.  the prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  and it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to whole food's ceo.\u000a\u000athe membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; i thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   that said, i live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.

Vconstruction junction is a gem. find gently and not so gently used furniture, building supplies, lighting, and all sorts of other stuff. the warehouse is huge, and if you look, there are some seriously cool treasures here. a giant(i'm talking probably 12' wide) chandelier, a wood-burning stove, 27 tons of sand stone in the parking lot. this is a great place to get cheap building supplies and help out the environment by recycling.\u000a\u000athat isn't the best part, though(well it might be, depending on what you're here for). construction junction is also home to many other awesome things. most notably, the space upstairs is aptly named the space upstairs - enter from the side into the world of the modern improv dance troupe the pillow project( http://www.pillowproject.org/ ). also, at night this is the location of pittsburgh's freeride ( http://freeridepgh.org/ ) program - a bike information and repair program which encourages people to learn how to fix old bikes to make them new, even offering people a free bike to fix up if they volunteer a certain number of hours. it's also the home of the steel city big pour, a local beer tasting event, and probably a lot more that i don't even know about.\u000a\u000aconstruction junction is definitely a treasure trove, and not just for building supplies, but for some of the coolest things in pittsburgh

Vif you've got that talent to create something out of the unexpected, then you have to stop here.\u000a\u000ai was looking for something unusual to use in my apartment for storage.  i had stopped at several big box stores around the city before here and left each one of them in disappointment. \u000a\u000ai must admit, driving to this place i was a little skeptical.  i pulled in and honestly thought that yelp directed me to a warehouse.  but i did not let that deter me from venturing out of my car and into the building.  once you walk inside it is like walking into someone's garage that you just want to rummage through.  you know what i mean, you walk in and see all this dingy looking stuff that you see potential in.  you want to take it home with you.  sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new, other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through.\u000a\u000ai easily spent a hour in here just browsing the shelves.  i saw potential in a lot of the items i saw lining their shelves.  and i took a few items home with me.  when i reached the register i was truly floored by the price.  when i say that, it's because it was so low.  i was expecting to pay more, but i definitely came out of there with more money in my pocket than i needed to, but that is one sure fired way to make sure that a person returns to your establishment.

Vvery trendy cool out of the way place that i definitely suggest you check out.  this is a tony pais restaurant, he owns another more formal place downtown but i forget the name.  he used to own baum vivant on baum blvd.  this was a great place.  the last i was there was 7 or 8 years ago.  it was total formal fuu fuu fine dining, but what an experience.  anyways, it's gone now and i haven't been to one of his places since until last night when a friend suggested we try this little oasis located on spahr st.  this place is the opposite with respect to atmosphere than baum vivant.  it's in a converted garage with a few outdoor tables.  it's cash only and byob.  it's very informal and i got away with wearing tennis shoes and my "super size my foie gras" fruit of the loom t-shirt.  don't need to get dressed up to enjoy amazing food.  the inside of the restaurant/garage has a high ceilings and an eclectic mix of non-matching tables that i imagine were collected from thrift stores.  the service was awesome, spot on from start to finish.  the lovely european women who served and hosted had big smiles and a genuine appreciation when we said we liked the food.  the meal started with some warm rolls that they may cook on site.  it was served with ice cold butter.  that's fine, but let's get a little more creative people on the butter, dips with the bread.  the first course was this amazing artichoke soup.  this literally is the best soup i've tried since i can remember and i eat out all the time.  the flavor was layored with the cream, maybe nutmeg, maybe spinach, and also what tasted to me like a shellfish broth.  it was a very complex flavor.  amazing!  next was a goat cheese dish served inside of phyllo dough.  it was tasty, but a little too rich for my taste.  the inside of the dough had apricots mixed with the goat cheese and the sauce was some type of combination of walnuts and apples pureed'.  interesting, but didn't add too much to the dish.  also, we tried a smoked salmon appetizer served on croutons with capers.  it was perfect and i really like their portions here.  they don't try to kill you with the size of the dishes.  my friend ordered the crabcakes, which were two small mostly lump crabmeat portions.  they were delicious served with a mushroom cream sauce.  the rice that was served with the crabcakes were another story, totally tasteless and not seasoned well. the rice was also a liitle mushy.  i tried the elysian fields lamb burger.  i had never seen an elysian fields lamb burger, so i thought i'd give it a try.  it was a decent portion (4 oz. i'd guess) at a reasonable price $11.  i didnt' really get to tell the difference between regular lamb and elysian because they overcooked the burger to well done and it lost much of the flavor.  overall, i'll stick to tessaro's for my burgers.  we finished with a chocolate mousse, which was okay but i thought too heavy for a mousse.  i got out of here with a $65 + tax bill for all this amazing food.  what's even better is that because it's byob i probably saved $30 for the bottle of wine as well.  i really like the fact i can have interesting food, relatively cheap in a casual atmosphere.  one last thing, they don't have ac so you may want to pick a cooler night if you plan on sitting indoors.  they also say they don't take reservations on the menu, but we were able to make a reservation on sunday for monday for two people.

Vi enjoyed this place, but wasn't completely wowed.  i was told that it's portuguese, but i'm not seeing what's so portuguese about it.  certainly a good continental restaurant, by any means.  \u000a\u000ai liked the atmosphere, and the service was good.  and the food was good too.  but for the price, i didn't think the food was that great.  i'll come again, but it won't be because i'm the one suggesting it.

Vok, so i admit that i was underwhelmed by cafe zinho when i first went, a few years ago.  and then i didn't go for a long time.  a few months back, my husband and i randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am i glad we did!  it's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\u000a\u000ai'll say again that i'm not certain how the food is portuguese.  that being said, it is mighty delicious.  i love the personal service.  i love the corn bread.  the starters are phenomenal, to the point where i sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  but when we get them, they are lovely too.  i love the ambiance.  in short, i owe cafe zinho an apology.

Vi've been to cafe zinho at least 25 times and i am sure to go back again soon.  the dining room is a funky garage space that has been converted into an eclectic europen bistro.  the food is very good and the atmosphere is relaxed and bohemian.  the puff pastry appetizer is always a winner.  the chef, tony pais, is portuguese, but there are a lot of elements of french cuisine in his cooking. he used to own cafe zao and baum vivant, both well regarded restaurants, but i find the food is much more reasonable at zinho. there's a few tables outside, and i find it enjoyable to choose those tables on a warm day.

Vdespite the bloody labor battles that were fought at the old homestead steel mills, the frick art and historical center is a very beautiful and quiet place to spend the day.  it is complex of museums and  buildings set in several acres of lawns and gardens in pittsburgh's east end.  it is a wonderful place to bring your out of town guests or just spend by yourself.\u000a\u000ayou begin your tour with the helen frick art museum, located on reynolds street.  it features  porcelains, bronzes, and rare examples of 17th and 18th-century furniture.  current exhibits include steel: pittsburgh drawings by craig mcpherson and a panorama of pittsburgh: nineteenth-century printed views. they will  remain on view through june 8, as part of pittsburgh's 250th anniversary.\u000a\u000anext we have the car and carriage museum.  henry clay frick was apparently quite an auto enthusiast.  his 1914 rolls royce silver ghost touring car is here as is the first car reportedly registered in pittsburgh.  my husband rick likes the 1931 lincoln.\u000a\u000athen we move on to my favorite, the greenhouse, the gardens, and the lawns.  i believe that admission is free if you just want to stroll around the lawns, which i like to do on a sunday in may.  in the late 19th century, greenhouses were very popular with wealthy families.\u000a\u000afinally we come to the house itself, clayton.  it was purchased for the then princely sum of $22,000 by the frick's in 1882.  it is done in the italianate style.  over 93% of the furnishings in the house are original, and that's what makes it so wonderful.  you get a fair sense of how the fricks lived--quite a contrast to the steelworkers!  \u000a\u000ano stop to the frick is complete without visiting the cafe.  they believe that good food is an art too and the service here is wonderful.  i took a friend out for her birthday recently.  we had lunch at the cafe, the menu rotates seasonally.  i tried the shrimp tostones, which was sauted white shrimp, autumn sprouts, toasted almonds, guava cream, and annatto oil.  in the mood for more "traditional" museum fare like hot dogs?  then try the "ultimate chili dog".  per the website, it is grilled chicken apple sausage, wild boar chili, grated gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and mustard piccalilli on a sourdough roll!\u000a\u000adon't forget to have tea here too.  it is wonderful and the service is impeccable!  you and your guests can easily spend a whole afternoon here!

Vi was here on mother's day with my mom, my mother-in-law, my aunt, and my cousin.  this was a "girl's day out", a gift to ourselves (we left the menfolk at home!).  afternoon tea was absolutely exquisite.  don't get me wrong--i love a good ballgame and hotdog just like everyone else.  but sometimes i gotta do "chick stuff" like this too!  \u000a\u000awe took the tour of the mansion and the frick art museum.  current exhibits include the road to impressionism: barbizon landscapes from the walters art museum and 1806, jena, a significant late-nineteenth-century painting by french artist jean-louis-ernest meissonier.  \u000a\u000athere is a lot to see and do at the frick.  get off your butts pittsburghers and enjoy this place!

Vit's been four years since i'd last reviewed the frick?  my mom and i always have our annual mother's day outing here.  women only--we leave our husbands to their own (de)vices!\u000a\u000athe frick always has a special mother's day program that includes garden walks, tours, and my favorite, high tea.  believe me, the high tea service here is exquisite.  this year mom and i went with my cousin cindy & her mom, and my best friend marla & her mom.  and this year's special exhibition at the art museum was (is) "a kind of alchemy: medieval persian ceramics.  this exhibit shows the diversity of ancient persian  (what is now present-day iraq, iran, and afghanistan) ceramics . these works were produced for both the luxury and middle-class markets.  even the common folk could afford decorative well-crafted ceramics.\u000a\u000athe only drawback to an otherwise perfect day was the chilly weather.  i had a new sundress i wanted to wear (and my mom still bemoans my tattoo).

Vi love little soft serve places like this.  the ice cream here gets an a+.  i had my classic--small vanilla cone dipped in rainbow sprinkles.  \u000a\u000apeople were talking about their family memories from when they'd eaten here in summers past in line--i'm not from the area, but it seems to be somewhat of an institution.  \u000a\u000ajust on our first stop we saw families of all ages, couples, bikers...everyone can enjoy this place.  definitely stop by if you're headed to the south side!

Vin my opinion, soft serve is the best kind of ice cream. i love dave and andy's, but i have lost many scoops trying to lick my ice cream and it tumbling off the cone and right onto the hot cement of forbes ave. (the 5 second rule does not apply here!!). \u000a\u000ai adore page's because it has everything! it reminds me of home, where i can go to pappy's in uniontown or bill's in belle vernon, places you can grab a burger, fries, nachos, a sundae, shake, or cone. variety is the spice of life!!!\u000a\u000awhile you're waiting in line, make sure to read the news paper clipping about the root beer barrel dj j mentioned.\u000a\u000athe parking area is weird and difficult in my opinion.

Vthis used to be my secret place, but i've told so many people about it that i have a hard time getting a reservation.  i've known jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  he's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  i had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in march and jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  he arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  okay, the food is great.  i especially recommend the veal chop.  the staff is awesome. i really like marney and errol (two main servers) and i like jordan the bartender upstairs (marney's daughter).  i'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  it's a little bit pricey.  the good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  the veal chop is $65.  that's a little much, especially considering the location.  the dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  i mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  i would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  one last tip, even though it's not byob anymore, you can still byob.  he won't turn you away.  this is one of my favorite restaurants.  the chef is really talented and i'd hazard a guess that if he was in new york he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  he's got the personality.

Vi gotta give my man jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  the upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  i can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  he's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  steve and clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  this is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  the food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  i do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  the salmon carpaccio last night is the best i've ever had.  the mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  i  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for douglas dick at bona terra).  in my original post i said it was a bit pricey, but i've decided it's well worth the cost now.  i also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  there's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.

Vmy husband made us reservations here to celebrate our 5th anniversary and i am confident in saying that it was the best meal i've had in pittsburgh.  the atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all, which is not often the case with "fine dining."  i appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed pens jerseys on the wall! i am becoming a yinzer...\u000a\u000athe bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  all their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (i didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)\u000a\u000ai ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  he said it was the best steak he's had since we left nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.\u000a\u000ayes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can definitely get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route i would take in the future since i'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.\u000a\u000ai think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!

Vhow can there be no reviews of max's allegheny? this north side german food institution in pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. they also tell you the story of the north side of pittsburgh, which i also found interesting. the place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. it's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\u000a\u000arandy s. and i headed there post tazza d'oro on a sunday for brunch. it happened to be the same very sunday the pens were playing the flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. on sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of germanic add ons like german farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \u000a\u000athe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. if that's not rad, i don't know what is. we told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \u000a\u000athe food was just what you would expect in pittsburgh: gut busting. it wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like i was in pittsburgh. i can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. and the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from dallas to ct. \u000a\u000aa really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).

Vreally excellent german food. everything on the menu is delicious. i always enjoy the knockwurst platter. the potato pancakes are great.  i used to think german food was always heavy, however when it's cooked well, the way max's serves it, it's light, tender and delicious.

Vi am a huge fan of breadworks. they make high quality breads at reasonable prices. they are very consistently good and the bread is always delicious and fresh. some favorites include the walnut raisin and the sourdough.  a good shopping tip is to arrive 1/2 hour before closing, and everything in the store is half off.

Vthe pros: dinosaurs in their time is pretty cool.  the years of renovation were worth it - the former dinosaur hall is completely transformed.  remember how everything was in straight lines and the dinosaurs were up on their big pedestals?  now the exhibit is sort of s-shaped, the walls are painted with colorful murals, the support columns are disguised as trees, there are plants around the dinosaurs and dead leaves underneath.  underneath every dinosaur is a nameplate with a lot of information and a touchscreen with even more information, including a section on how the carnegie museum researchers contributed to the discovery or naming of this dinosaur.  there is a lot more natural light than i remember, and there are 2 balconies that overlook the exhibits for more photo opportunities.  there is also an extensive timeline of the carnegie museum's expeditions and contributions to paleontology, and a timelapse video of the renovations.\u000a\u000athe cons: the rest of the history museum is pretty lame compared to this new and awesome exhibit.  the biggest examples are the 2nd floor halls of african and north american wildlife and the 3rd floor birds hall.  big cases of taxidermy in a wood-paneled room with dim lighting - hardly thrilling.  the 3rd floor polar world is starting to look dated too.  even the fonts used date the exhibits.\u000a\u000aadmission is now $15 for adults, $11 for students (free for pitt students!).  this does get you into the carnegie museum of art also, but i'm usually tired after doing the whole history museum so i never get over to the art side.  i would recommend seeing the dinosaurs, then skipping the rest of the history museum if you've been there before.  the dinosaurs in their time would get five stars on its own, but the rest of the museum is lagging behind unfortunately.

Vi had a week off from work recently.  i needed it to take a little break and i decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'burgh?\u000a\u000ato say that the carnegie is the pittsburgh cultural institution is indeed an understatement and as i live in nearby squirrel hill, i am so happy to have it within walking distance.  although the day i visited, i rode my bike and parked it all day.  (note to yelp'er mike o. from park ridge, il--i didn't wipe out this time!).\u000a\u000ai decided to spend the entire day at the carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  as emily h. says, the dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  it went from being a stuffy, dull, "stuffed and mounted" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  the murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  the exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\u000a\u000aa long-time favorite of mine is the hillman hall of minerals and gems.  i've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  the museum just added the wertz gallery of gems and jewelry to the hillman hall.  the gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  the current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from h.j. heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\u000a\u000abut as much as i enjoy natural science, i really love art.  the carnegie museum of art includes  american art from the late nineteenth century, french impressionist and post-impressionist paintings, and european and american decorative arts.   the heinz architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  i particularly enjoy asian art and the carnegie has an extensive collection of japanese prints.  \u000a\u000aone special exhibit that i really recommend will be there only until october 18, 2008 and it is "abstract art before 1950: watercolors, drawings, prints, and photographs".  it consists of avant-garde works by european, american, and japanese artists.  \u000a\u000aso while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the natural history museum and the museum of art.  to get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  i did and i still feel like i didn't see everything.

Vso much to see! i was visiting pittsburgh for a weekend and was wondering around, looking at downtown and my future school, cmu, when it started raining. i ducked in here, not really knowing what it was and what to expect. \u000a\u000ai've only made it through 3/4 of the first floor but you can easily spend an entire day here and it might not be enough. i visited the architecture, gems and stones and rushed through the dinosaurs.\u000a\u000anone of the exhibits were too crowded (on a sat!) , you could browse in peace and not feel rushed.

Vwell susan the procrastinator had left yet another review pending for a couple of weeks!  anyway, my mom and i went to the carnegie museum of art to see the exhibit, "read my pins: the madeleine albright collection".  we went  on march 4, 2012 the day it closed.  o' but i'm so glad we saw it, albeit at the last minute!  \u000a\u000amadeline albright has always been one of  my favorite women in politics.  in 1997, albright was named the first female secretary of state and became, at that time, the highest ranking woman in the history of the u.s. government.  prior to that, she was ambassador to the u.n.  while serving under president bill clinton, first as u.s ambassador to the united nations, and then as secretary of state, albright became known for wearing brooches that purposefully conveyed her views about the situation at hand.  she was famous for saying, "while president george h.w. bush had been known for saying 'read my lips,' i began urging colleagues and reporters to 'read my pins.'"\u000a\u000ain 1994, saddam hussein's government-controlled press referred to then-u.s. ambassador to the un albright as an "unparalleled serpent." she then wore a golden snake brooch to her next meeting on iraq,  \u000a\u000ai was really quite enthralled by the collection that secretary albright cultivated.  as my guide says, "the collection is distinctive and democratic-sometimes demure and understated, sometimes outlandish and outspoken-spanning more than a century of jewelry design and including fascinating pieces from across the globe."   some of the pieces on display were fine antiques, such as the circa 1880 "blue bird".   but many of the pieces were costume jewelry.  \u000a\u000ai guess my favorite piece was "liberty brooch".  now this piece, circa 1997 by gijs bakker, is the head of lady liberty with two watch faces for eyes, one of which is upside down-allowing both her and her visitor to see when it is time for an appointment to end.  a very clever piece, and judging by the others' comments at the exhibit, i'm not the only one with that opinion.  mom really loved it too.  \u000a\u000aso this was a really powerful exhibit of an eclectic collection of jewelry.  i strongly recommend reading the accompanying book, "read my pins: stories from a diplomat's jewel box", which you can get at barnes & noble or amazon.  madeleine albright is an inspiration to women in politics and government.

Vgreat place to go for a cheap lunch if your in the area. \u000a\u000asteves is a great local dive for burgers and dogs. they are a great alternative to hospital food if you work at or are are visiting someone at allegheny general hospital. \u000a\u000athey offer burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, chicken and ham sandwiches, ,blts, kielbasa, fish sandwiches and fries. burgers start at $1.00 and hot dogs start at 93 cents. you can add chili, sauerkraut, cheese and jalapenos to their hot dogs. there is a small counter to eat at but most people get their food to go. \u000a\u000athe food is great and the prices are even better. \u000a\u000acash only!

Vnow this is the atria's i remember.\u000a\u000ai have been coming to this location since pnc park opened. in the beginning everything was great. great food and outstanding service. then everything went down hill. the most popular items were taken off the menu. the portions were cut down and the quality of the food when down with it. service was horrible as well. we stopped going for years because by that time pittsburgh was in a restaurant boom. the cheesecake factory, mccormick & schmick's and a lot of other similar restaurants had opened.\u000a\u000ai recently started going back to atria's when a co worker decided to treat me to lunch since it's near my office. the great food and service is back! the burgers are excellent! i highly recommend the crab cakes, they are second best behind monterey bay. i love the sherry crab bisque and the pot roast nachos appetizer are a must try! \u000a\u000ai just went for a christmas work lunch and everything was perfect. we had ten people and everyone loved their food. everyone got something different, burgers, steaks seafood, salads and sandwiches. the service was excellent. all of our glasses were refilled constantly before they ever got even half way empty.\u000a\u000athe atria's i know and love is back!

Vdon't do it! \u000a\u000athe ribs are average at best. the sides are just as average as well. the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. the greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. \u000a\u000athis place is almost as bad as the now closed mr willie's bbq in squirrel hill! i had such high hopes for this place. oh well. that's what i get for trying to cheat on showcase bbq in homewood. now those are the best ribs in pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! \u000a\u000athey don't take debit or credit cards. cash only!

Vone of my favorite places for take-out in pittsburgh.  the ribs are cooked southern style, and just the way i love them.  this is extremely satisfying slow cooked wood fire bbq.  you have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.\u000a\u000athe service is quirky, but i find it charming.  the decor is "down home."\u000a\u000athe hot sauce is hotter than you might expect...so i recommend you ask for a mix, or just go for the mild.\u000a\u000alet's just say i every so often get a craving for wilson's bbq, and it's always a special treat.

Vo my pittsburgh pirates.  what a storied history you have!  but the last time you went to the post season was in 1992,  and i remember it well.    i worked as a ticket taker at the old three rivers stadium and i have such fond memories of working there.  i was 17 when you won your last divisional title and i don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.\u000a\u000adon't get me wrong, my bucs!  i do love you so much.  in a way, i have to.  see, you're like the boy i knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  \u000a\u000alet's take a look at your records since 2000.  i warn you dear pirates--it won't be pretty.  but it's something you have to come to terms with:\u000a\u000a2001:  62-100 (last pl)\u000a2002:  72-89 (4th pl)\u000a2003:  75-87 (4th pl)\u000a2004:  72-89 (5th pl)\u000a2005:  67-95 (last)\u000a2006:  67-95 (5th pl)\u000a2007:  68-94 (last)\u000a2008:  67-95 (last)\u000a2009:  62-99 (last)\u000a2010:  56-101 (last)*     *as of 09-29-2010\u000a\u000aso that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.\u000a\u000ayes, i'll still go to your games next season.  i'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my girl posse.  my dad and i will still have our father-daughter nights out here.  but like the parents of that sweet little boy in grammar school with the failing grades, you're really trying my patience.  and don't forget, the washington wild things have been wooing me for the longest!

Vokay my pittsburgh pirates.  you maybe deserve 2 1/2 stars this past season.  like joe d. says, you were in first place for a short time.  just think--2011 could have been known as "the season in which we didn't suck".  we could have aimed for mediocrity and a .500 record.  but then you went on a bad losing streak at the end!  arrrgh!  \u000a\u000awell at least the astros and the cubs kept us out of last place!    \u000a\u000abut i give you an extra 1/2 star for having jerseys in women's sizes (ahem, washington wild things http://www.yelp.com/biz/washington-wild-things-washington#hrid:bwxqf9wwj9yvaueqhdm8jw/src:self ).  we like baseball too and the women's sizes fit us way better than the men's do.  my folks gave me one for christmas 'cos my old one (in a man's size) wore out.  the new one fits well and looks great!

Va cautious 3.5 stars here but....\u000a\u000as-w-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-p!\u000a\u000athe bucs swept the royals in interleague play this past weekend!  and okay, i was there for the second game, not the third.  but i took my dad to the game for an early father's day gift.  we had a wonderful time as the pirates defeated the royals 5-3.  and i'm watching the pirates with guarded optimism here.  they're off to the same great start they were last year. an article in the paper said that they were playing small ball, which must eman they're working on the little things, the fundamentals.  \u000a\u000anow let's see if we can keep the momentum going for the rest of the season and finish with at least a winning record for a chiange.  oh well, at least with the chicago cubs sucking so badly we won't be in the cellar.

Vugh!  another losing season.  wtf man, weren't we in first place at the all-star break?  what happened?  i wasn't expecting a world series champ or even a pennant winner.  but was a winning season too much to ask for?  this marks the 20th anniversary since the pirates' last winning season.  that's right folks--it's been since 1992.  let's take a look at the world of 1992.\u000a\u000abaseball:  the pirates' roster that year included stan belinda, doug drabek, zane smith, denny neagle, jay bell, orlando merced, andy van slyke, and of course barry bonds.  all have since retired.  the only new ballparks were new comiskey park (now u.s. cellular field) and camden yards.  no stadiums had corporate names.  the arizona diamondbacks, the colorado rockies, the miami marlins, and the tampa bay (devil) rays didn't exist.  the washington nationals were the montreal expos.  the milwaukee brewers were in the al.  both the nl and the al only had two divisions each.  the minor league washington wild things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  kbl was the big cable sports channel.\u000a\u000atv:  "saturday night live's" cast included dana carvey, ellen cleghorne, chris farley, tim meadows, mike myers, kevin nealon, phil hartman,  chris rock, adam sandler, rob schneider, and david spade.  "seinfeld" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew kramer's first name.  monday nights on nbc included "murphy brown", "evening shade" and " northern exposure".\u000a\u000amovies:  the top movies included "lethal weapon 3", "basic instinct", "hone alone 2", "the bodyguard" and "aladdin".  when you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on vhs tapes or laserdiscs.  \u000a\u000amusic:  bruce springsteen released "lucky town" and "human touch"  on the same day.  r.e.m. had "automatic for the people".  gin blossoms released their first album "new miserable experience", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  bare naked ladies "gordon" featured the cult classic "if i had a million dollars."  you either listened to albums on cassette or cd and you bought them at record stores like national record mart.  doug hopkins (gin blossoms), kurt cobain (nirvana), shannon hoon (bline melon) and jerry garcia (grateful dead) were all alive.\u000a\u000atechnology:  few people had internet access.  you also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  you watched movies on a vcr.  you met up with your friends without texting them.  you ordered merchandise by "sending in" or by calling an "800" number.  you had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \u000a\u000aand oj simpson was still a football hero.\u000a\u000aso that's it, pittsburgh pirates.  i feel like telling you i'm done with you guys.  i'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough.

Vjason, you are right on the money!  scaife is part of the ultra-right-wing bunch.  i certainly don't bemoan an individual's right to his/her politics (i'll admit i'm a little left-of-center), but this scaife guy makes rupert murdoch look like al gore.  and your tabloid comments are oh, so true.\u000a\u000ai do give it two stars because its......oh, wait a minute.... can't think of a reason for two stars.  so i'll just give it one!

Vschorr is a very good bakery that makes excellent cakes and donuts.  the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.  i do wish they would be open after 4 pm (hours are  mon - sat, 7am - 4pm). this bakery has been there a long time and it's a pittsburgh tradition.

Vkuhn's automatically receive 1  for being open 24 hours. beyond that, customer service has been great, the shelves are stocked well, prepared food and deli items are better for you than fast food with better ingredients at a better value! when i'm in the the are, this is my go-to shopping spot.

Vnice, quiet neighborhood coffee bar.  however, the elementary school a block away gets out at 3:25, and from 3-4 it can be crowded with moms and younger siblings stopping in to pass the time.  outside those times, it's always quiet with nice music and delicious pastries.

Vsushi three is located in a strip of shops on beverly road, alongside a coffee shop, florist, several banks, and two pizza places.  this and little tokyo are, to my knowledge, the only sushi restaurants in mt. lebanon.\u000a\u000asushi three has an extensive menu that seems to have expanded since the last time i visited, and has lots more than just sushi.  there is a long list of appetizers, tempuras and teriyaki dishes, and some chinese offerings.  the main focus, the sushi, takes up a large portion of the menu, and there are many different rolls, ranging from the basic kappa rolls to the complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg and caviar).  as a vegetarian, i appreciate the vegetable sushi platter, which i have never seen anywhere else and only costs $12.  there is even a separate vegetarian menu.\u000a\u000awhile i do appreciate the wide-ranging menu, i just can't like the atmosphere.  it's always very quiet and dark inside, and i always get the feeling of being in a cave.  i prefer to get take-out or delivery.\u000a\u000aoverall, i prefer little tokyo, but with sushi three's improved menu and large number of vegetarian options, my rating may change soon.

Vi just got lunch from here today.  for $9.63, i got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  it was a ton of food and more than filling enough - i didn't even eat the salad and i was stuffed.  i will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - i added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  even though it was a bit pricier than i was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat.

Vi was in the mood for some chinese and really wanted to try red tea house because i've heard really great things about it but they have strange delivery times and i was unable to pick the food up myself... so i opted for green garden instead.\u000a\u000ai sampled vegetable egg foo young, hot & sour soup and bean curd with mixed vegetable. i received three generous eggy vegetable pancakes which had potential but unfortunately, they were left in the frier a little too long and soaked in a lot of excess grease. i think the accompanying sauce is actually beef gravy and bland (the great thing about eating at home is the opportunity to improvise...i whipped up a quick peanut sauce that went great with the egg foo young)\u000a\u000athe hot and sour soup was decent, they use fresh mushrooms and the broth is a nice consistency (i.e. not too thick). the bean curd and veggies were nothing fancy, the veggies held some crunch and the curd had a palatable texture but was drowning in brown sauce. \u000a\u000athe food was piping hot and delivered fast.

Vi have to say i really loved this place.  i love the mesh of old and new.  i love a greasy spoon.  most of all, i love the fact that i can visit here any time of the day.\u000a\u000ai have heard of tom's for a very long time.  i remember there being a tom's in the south side and visiting it many times, but this spot is so different.  there's a different vibe here, more laid back, less bustle.  walking in here makes you feel as if you are entering a tiny road stop diner, you kind of forget that you are still within the pittsburgh region, especially if you stop here in the wee hours of the morning.\u000a\u000ai grabbed a booth to myself and within a minute the waitress was there to hand me a menu and ask me what i wanted to drink.  looking over the menu took me some time seeing how this was my first visit here.  i ended up ordering a blt with a side of loaded fries.  while waiting for my food to arrive i looked around the place and took it all in.  the colors, decor, and furniture definitely give you that diner vibe.  when i think of a diner i think of the shiny chrome, the bright white and red checkered pattern and bar stools at a counter.  all of that is here!\u000a\u000amy food finally arrived and i started to dive into it.  the first thing that popped into my head was, "why did i order a side of fries?"  the blt comes with a decent side portion of fries to begin with, i really didn't need more fries.  the blt itself was perfect.  the bacon was greasy, yet crisp, the lettuce was refreshing and the tomato was just the right thickness.  add a little mayo to the toasted bread and we are in business.  it was so good i wish i had just ordered two blts.  the loaded fries were pretty good as well.  topped with cheese sauce and bacon (man, i just couldn't get enough of that bacon).\u000a\u000athe waitress on duty was super polite and very attentive.  even though it was very early in the morning, she did not miss a beat or sit around.  the only gripe i have about this place is the prices.  some of them need to be readjusted, but other than that, it's a stellar place to get a meal.\u000a\u000a**something to note: they do serve alcohol here.

Vlooks and smells like a decrepit moldy old place because of the pool. the layout is confusing, the people staying are sometimes a little sketchy (or maybe church folk in uniform and highway hotels just creep me out, i don't know.), but there's free wifi (unsecured), an indian buffet, a bbq place, and more than competent staff. good enough.\u000a\u000aexcept a little after midnight some dude woke me up knocking on the door, and insisting i had ordered a cab. i had not. it was weird. the next morning i noticed they were doing some maintenance and remodeling on the front lobby and air conditioning system, so maybe there will only be ongoing improvements.

Vblah blah blah, cold toppings, piled high cheese, yinzer childhoods, etc. beto's gets three stars because it is inconsistent - and they themselves admit it. i've had pizza from here that is outright bad, i've also had pizza here which nudged against my all time top pizzas list. usually there will be a cycle for me where i will have a really good slice, and convince myself i have to go back there - sometimes in the same week. then i'll have a bad slice and forget about it for months, maybe even years. then i'll be in the area again and the cycle will continue. \u000a\u000athe cold cheese doesn't bug me because you get so much (portion size here is far beyond ample. $1.25 for each slice - 4 is well beyond my maximum - gets you about a 1/3 of a bag of mozzarella, an extra $.50 will get you as much of whatever topping you feel like having). if you get take-out, it'll pretty much melt by the time you get home if you leave the box shut. \u000a\u000aone thing to note - this is my favorite place to get black olives on a pizza, since they don't go into the oven.

Vwow, just wow. that was without a doubt the worst "pizza" i've ever had in my life. maybe you would like it. do you like all of your toppings out of a can? i didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? if answer is yes, then maybe this place is for you. it is definitely not for me.

Vi've only had breakfast here once, so hopefully my review can be updated in the future. \u000ai thought it was good, but i wasn't overwhelmed with culinary joy. the atmosphere is friendly and bustling. the menu seems nicely edited, and apparently they make lots of their ingredients from scratch. i had 2 eggs over medium, their in-house ham from the bone, texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (i got sour cream). the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. the potato pancakes were different than what i expected. i thought they would be like fried hashbrown cakes, but they were shredded potatoes mixed with a pancake-like batter. they weren't crispy or hot, and just kind of underwhelming. i'll be back though since they have grits :)

Vthe hotel has a little listing for maharaja which includes some pretty specific and weird hours, none of which include mondays. i called on a monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. i showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. buffet closes at 9:30.\u000a\u000athey didn't speak about, point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. i was immediately pointed to the buffet and told "have whatever you want" or something similar. there were 6 veg options,  4 meats (biryanis and curries), nan, poori and bhajis, kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, some good chai,  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.\u000a\u000ameals ends with mukhwa, but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls. the emphasis on customer self-reliance here could be construed as bad or lazy service, but i appreciate the lax environment.

Vthis is a very typical neighborhood foodland.  it looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the steelers "immaculate reception", but it kind of has a certain well-worn charm.  the place is crowded and cramped too, but not unpleasant.  the parking lot is very small, but as i was taking the "t", it wasn't an issue.   i stopped here last night because i was in the neighborhood attending a meeting at someone's house close by and i volunteered to pick up a treat. \u000a\u000ai'd say that this place is worth it for your run-of-the-mill staples and nothing else.

Vlovely floral arrangements for every occasion.  her boutonnieres and corsages are lovely and inexpensive - she must have made dozens for me and my friends during high school.  you cannot beat the service here.  when students at the elementary school up the street come in wanting flowers for their teachers, she will provide them with the best for only $1 or $2.  blooming dahlia is the best example of hometown service i could imagine.

Vgreat selection that you won't find elsewhere.  especially brands i haven't seen before.  it is a bit cramped in here, watch your step, i about fell/tripped a dozen times in here.\u000a\u000athere is a cooler if you were looking to take something out and start drinking right away.  and the staff are helpful if you need the help.  most times people walk in with what they want in their mind already, so they sometimes look bored.\u000a\u000athe negatives of this place, parking is horrible.  especially on that stretch of south braddock.  stay away during the evening rush.  everyone seems to be trying to get out of the city and think that taking this route to bypass the tunnels will alleviate their time.  also, the prices seem a bit outrageous on certain items.  might be better off going elsewhere if you are looking for the more exotic.  but for this area, you would think that with another distributor less than a mile away, prices would be better.

Vthis place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  they've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  i liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  so, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  i brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the dc area.  (go pittsburgh!).  the selection is nice and its good to see that i can find those out of the way beers so that i don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.  \u000a\u000athe hot dogs?  none of us were gushing about them afterward.  but they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection.

Vwell, it has good hot dogs and a wide, wide variety of beer, stocking without pretense; miller and unibrau.  the hot dogs are good.  the beer is unfortunately not so cheap; six packs aren't much cheaper than just buying four or five beers.  bad for groups more that four people; great for two or three.

Vto speak ill of d's would be blasphemy to any true pittsburgher. it really doesn't get much better if you're in the mood for pub grub. pizza is awesome, the fries are amazing - i'm going to go as far as saying better than potato patch - they are so crispy and not swimming in grease! what is their magic method? the burgers and dogz - all gluttonous goodies and you can get them all veggie style. if you're watching your waist line you may want to skip this place...but i say go ahead and treat yourself! \u000a\u000aoh! and did i mention the beer selection isn't too shabby? watermelon beer in the summer...mouth watering.

Venter into d's (after figuring out the correct door - i still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. for chrissakes, they have delirium on tap! the real jewel, though, is in the back. you have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. d's is still the only place i've ever found the elusive hopfenweisen by schneiderweiss and brooklyn brewery, perhaps the best beer i've ever had.\u000a\u000awhile d's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. the pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.\u000a\u000afinally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding.

Vthere's no wrong way to eat a hot dog.  especially if it's topped with cheese, fries and coleslaw.\u000a\u000aimagine if you will me sitting there and a myriad of punctuation marks pop up over my head as if i were in a cartoon.  my puzzlement showing because i have no sure shot way of how to accomplish eating this masterfully prepared awesomeness just sat down in front of me.  or maybe it was because i wasn't sure i wanted to attack my big ben first or the pub fries i decided to order on the side.  my mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  have been the raspberry ale i chosen from the beer cave prior to me sitting down.  \u000a\u000ato say this hot dog is good is an insult to d's.  you better be prepared to say this hot dog is delicious, out of this world, life altering.......and maybe even orgasmic :o  the mixture of the poppy seed bun, coleslaw, fries, cheese, and beefy goodness....heaven.  pub fries, pub fries, oi, oi, oi!  some of the best fried up taters i've ever had.  and to put some cheesy goodness on there was amazing.  but the best part was the cooked oh so right bacon that kind of melted in your mouth.  sounds salty, no?  that's what the ranch is for.\u000a\u000ai have no idea why i waited so long to try this place out, i should be shunned for this.  if you are to shun me, shun me back to the beer cave, there are still several other beers i would love to try.\u000a\u000athe wait staff kind of remind you of worker bees.  always in motion, always doing something, and very attentive.\u000a\u000ain all honesty, i really wish i could give this place more than five stars.

Vafter reading a majority of the prior reviews of this place, i feel like i should get out the soapbox again, because some of you should be ashamed of yourselves.  especially the one that never stepped foot inside.  i mean how do you write a review of a place you never experienced.  and all the complaining about the smoke...get used to it.  what did you do years ago when people were allowed to smoke wherever they went?  yes, i know it's a nuisance.  yes, i am a smoker myself, but i have enough common sense to be a polite smoker (this is my personal choice, and it is your personal choice not to smoke, as it is a business' choice to allow or not allow smoking in its establishment).\u000a\u000aanyway, let's move forward.  i was skeptical of this place long before ever reading reviews, and long before i discovered yelp.  the outside of the bar looks old, which may have been a factor in deterring me for so long.  it looks like it would be a one room tiny bar, but looks are deceiving, it is actually a big space.\u000a\u000athe front is a typical barroom.  the bar takes up a good part of the room.  but there is a fair amount of space for people to walk about freely when going to the door.  behind the bar is a small seating area where there are bar stools.  in the back of the place they appear to have just about everything you would expect a bar to have.  pool table, multiple dart boards, and i even believe a shuffleboard table.  i cannot speak of how it is in the back as i only glanced on my way to the bathroom.  the bathroom i had used however, was rather small.  just enough room for you to do your business and turn around to wash your hands.\u000a\u000athe staff here on the particular night i attended were polite, funny and nice to chat with.  they were knowledgeable about the brews on tap and every beer they had in stock.  the drinks, by the way, were truly amazing.  just the right mixture of everything when they made up your drink of choice.  and just to make sure you were enjoying the drink, the bartender came back around and asked if it was to your liking.  the bartender even made sure it wasn't too strong and offered to add to the drink to balance it better.\u000a\u000aas for the limited food they had to offer, i cannot really talk about.  the food i did see that patrons ordered looked palatable, so on my next visit i might give it a try.  i have to say, that any place that offers popcorn for $.25 is alright by me (better than having it sitting on the bar and you have no idea who has put their hands in there).

Va great dive in regent square.\u000a\u000a if you long for a break from the crowds at d'z and the tap room, this is your place. you will not receive angry stars from the regulars as you walk in and the bartenders are friendly.it's quite smoky though so be prepared to come out wreaking of nicotine.

Vdunning's grill is another one of those solid neighborhood joints.  nothing on the menu here'll surprise you, but you'll get good chow for your buck here.  we're taling standard bar fare here--burgers, wraps, fish sandwiches, and variations of fried and grilled chicken.  \u000a\u000ait's a good place to meet up with your friends before or after a movie at the nearby regent's square as i did.  i had the blt which was as good as any other blt i've had at least a dozen other places.  they have vegetarian options here but if you're a true vegetarian or vegan be forewarned!  they're really meatless variations of their regular menu items.

Vthis is a charming little place overshadowed by d'z dogs (which is amazing as well) but we're not always in the mood for hot dogs and french fries. dunnigan's provides an adequate bar with daily specials. the menu is an upgrade from your typical bar/grill. of course the star item on the menu would have to be the french onion soup which boasts rich broth soaked up by a thick slice of chewy bread that holds up well and plentiful caramelized onions all smothered by gooey cheese broiled until bubbling to golden perfection. mmmm.....\u000a\u000athe restaurant is roomy and comfortable. perfect for a nice night out with your sweetheart.

Vit's amazing!  i'm a thrifter and a film buff but in all the years i've had a screenie pass to the regent square theater, i've never been here.  i've always been promising myself i'd stop in here sometime.  so f-i-n-a-l-l-y i was able to get my butt in here & do some serious thrifting.\u000a\u000aambiance boutique is not like any other thrift store.  they don't sell crap here.  you won't find any kmart knock off brands.  and if you take a close look at their website, you'll notice they are v-e-r-y picky about what they accept http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/documents/consignment.pdf http://www.ambianceboutique.org/html/faq.html\u000abut this totally benefits the consumer.  you'll find a lot of great high end, gently used brands here.  you'll also find that this store is clean 'n' bright, well organized, and the sales staff here really knows their stuff.\u000a\u000awhat's truly wonderful about ambiance is it's part of bethlehem haven.  bethlehem haven is an organization that provides services to homeless women, giving them housing and teaching them life skills in order to be self sufficient.  i'm all about vintage wear, thrifting, and reusing still-viable goods.  and if by doing so i'm supporting a valuable charity, so much the better.\u000a\u000awell the upshot was i didn't quite find what i was looking for.  i wanted some spring and summerwear, particularly sundresses and halter tops.  but i came away with a nice gently used michael kors brown leather bag and a sweet men's polo button down shirt.  no, it's not for rick.  it's for me!  hmmmm--might be for me to wear for rick!

Vright, so......\u000a\u000afirst off, hire employees that actually appreciate having a job.  not ones that are there because they are forced to.  that way, maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  if you start off with a bad experience with an employee, you're not going to get a great review.\u000a\u000ai went here midday on a sunday.  thought that was a great idea, especially when i got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before i am even acknowledge that i am there.  finally order and pull around, i wait another five minutes.  i could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but me.\u000a\u000ai'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  i was made to feel like i was interrupting her day and that i should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.\u000a\u000ayou know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, i just used that word)?  leaving the drive thru, driving the distance to my house, walking into my house, sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasn't given to me.  *enter angry expletives here*\u000a\u000ai doubt i'll be revisiting this location again, i'll drive the further distance from my place the next time i'm craving a taco or two.

Vthis is the closest grocery store to me, and i go out of my way to avoid it.  finding a parking spot is horrible with stop signs everywhere right in front of the main entrance to the store.\u000a\u000aeverything is all out of place and it's hard to make a connection as to where a product might be located in the store.  mind you there are in the middle of a remodel, so i may come back and make and addendum to my review at a later date after the dust settles.  \u000a\u000aas prices go, they are the norm for the pittsburgh area.  variety, yeah, they got that covered.  tidiness, they are working on that.

Vwith the recent update at this location it is much easier to navigate the store.  it's nicer, bigger and has a better selection of ready made foods.  it's amazing how a remodel can make an establishment a much better place to shop.\u000a\u000astill putting on a few finishing touches here and there, but i might actually stop in more frequently to pick up something quick to eat at the ready made counters.  it'll make it easier when i'm running late after the gym to just pick it up and go from here.\u000a\u000aparking lot is still a mess, but will hardly ever change.\u000a\u000aoh, watch out too, they have applied for a liqueur license to be able to sell six packs with their addiction of a cafe...smart move giant eagle.  not very many places in the swissvale/edgwood area to go pick up a quick brew.

Vi don't remember the last time i stepped into a fast food burger joint.  every time i come here, whether it be midday, evening, or late night there is always a wait in the drive thru.  \u000a\u000ago at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while.  \u000a\u000aoh, yeah, the food isn't all that bad either, props for the "fresh cut fries."

Vnothing special, it is kmart after all.  \u000a\u000adeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  it is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  i can relate, i did my time in retail.  although i left it when my time was due.  \u000a\u000agood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area.

Vi'm surprised this kmart has gotten such low reviews! i actually like shopping here and i come quite frequently. all the shelves are well stocked and it is clean here. it's just the lighting that may make the store look dingy. i have found plenty of good deals here, especially with clothing and hair accessories. there is even a points reward program that allows you to get additional discounts when you accumulate a certain amount of points. another reason why i like shopping here is that it's not crowded like other department stores, so i can shop in peace. unfortunately, that's bad for kmart because the store seems too empty at times and it certainly needs more customers. this is not a bad place to shop; i recommend this kmart to anyone.

Voh, american fast food chains.  how large your portions.  how nostalgic you are.\u000a\u000awe were the proud owners of a gift card to applebee's (christmas gift!) and the best part of this gift was my boyfriend's reaction to me later.  he has never been to an applebee's.  or an olive garden.  or a chili's.  his first time at a red lobster was with me when we were stuck in a strip mall hell for the night.  so he's new to these restaurants, which so many of us grew up with.  i'd only been to an applebee's a handful of times, but i was down to go back - it seems like they sort of have everything, no matter what you're hungry for.\u000a\u000asince we're spending all our time now packing to move back to chicago (woohoo!), we don't always have time to make dinner.  so we busted out the applebee's gift card and journeyed to edgewood towne center for some chain restaurant foods.  \u000a\u000awhen we arrived, this server really awkwardly asked us to sit at the bar.  i missed the finer points of the interaction, since he was talking to my boyfriend, but he basically insinuated that he'd just sat some large tables, or something, and it was his turn to have a table in his section but he didn't have the time to serve us, or something, and he didn't want us to wait (for what, i'm not sure) so he was basically like "can you sit at the bar?"  which was weird because there were like, at least a dozen open tables.   but whatevs.  the cool kids sit at the bar, and we are the cool kids.\u000a\u000achuck, the bartender, was running this show.  dude.  he was on top of everything.  taking orders, serving drinks, answering phones, getting takeout orders, keeping his bar neat and tidy - he was hopping!  we were both in awe just watching him.  that man is earning his tips, for reals.  so i'd recommend sitting at the bar if chuck is working.  he's also cute, so bonus there.  the applebee's bar is kind of a hilarious place - random people having drinks as if it's a real bar and not a restaurant, this one lady reading a book with a glass of wine like it was some fancy cafe, some annoying fratty people....and us.  a healthy mix.\u000a\u000ai had a shock top and my boyfriend had a sam adams - mad props for shock top on draft, not expecting that from applebee's.  we ordered spinach and artichoke dip, which i believe was half price (as are all apps) during happy hour.  it was served with regular tortilla chips (like from a bag) but the dip itself was pretty tasty.  it was served in a really wide but shallow crock, and tasted appropriately spinachy and cheesy.  it was served very hot and was pretty satisfying!\u000a\u000amy side salad arrived shortly thereafter, and it was amusingly huge for a side.  iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, crispy croutons, shredded cheese, tangy bottled italian dressing on the side.  i bought it to balance out my entree, but somehow these iceberg lettuce salads never really feel healthy, you know? like eating crispy water.  with cheese and croutons.  yay health!\u000a\u000athen came the entrees - i got an order of wings (which i think is technically listed as an appetizer) with "sweet and spicy sauce" which was listed as the second-hottest sauce on the menu.  they were pretty decent - served hot, juicy chicken, and the sauce was sweet and sticky.  it was a little *too* sweet for me - picture gloopy chinese takeout in sweet sticky sauce, and that's what the wing sauce was like - but it still made a satisfying meal.  my boyfriend got one of their "special burgers" from their new new orleans menu -something like a bourbon bacon burger.  they asked him "pink or no pink" which we thought was funny.  he said "pink," and the burger came out with like, a tiny touch of maybe-pink in the middle.  medium-rare, this ain't!  he said it was okay.  not great.  just a burger.  i didn't taste it, i just nibble on a few of his fries, which were pretty average.\u000a\u000athat all came in at around $30, aided greatly by the happy hour appetizer discount.  i have no interest in going to applebee's again because i can get better burgers, pasta, chicken, bar food, everything, etc anywhere else, but if i was road tripping and needed a place to stop, this wouldn't be a bad choice.  sit at the bar and hope chuck is there, and enjoy pretty average versions of american bar food.

Vwith this location being at a busy intersection off an exit from the parkway makes it almost a nightmare to use this place.  hardly any parking if you don't need to actually get gas.\u000a\u000athe inside of the store is on the small side as well.  doesn't help that the store part is changing from the bp branded store to a 7-eleven.  i swear that they decided it was amazing to put in an atm that was four times the size than what was there before.  be careful not to trip over the loose floor tiles as well.\u000a\u000anot very many choices for gas off the edgewood/swissvale exit, so maybe wait to go to another location.

Vthey took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  they'll make one for you especially but i always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.\u000a\u000aplus, this one is always really quiet.  like, i feel guilty, like i'm troubling the staff.  and you have to drive through an apartment's parking lot to get there.  very awkward location and atmosphere.

Vi thought the food was absolutely delicious and fresh. our hibachi chef, hoy, was fantastic! i ordered tofu and veggies (asparagus, broccoli, onion, snow peas), for me everything was prepared to perfection. we didn't get a show, but we had really good conversation throughout our lunch.\u000a\u000aour server was, in his words "still waking up" and not on top of his game at all, he forgot to put in my boyfriends extra fried rice and something for the guests we were seated with. when the server doesn't put in an order, the kitchen doesn't put it on the cart and when your chef gets to the grill, he doesn't have everything he needs and everything gets held up. \u000a\u000ai left with a big happy belly which is not usually the case when i eat hibachi and everyone else in my party was just as pleased!\u000a\u000afun fact: benihana is no longer able to pop food in your mouth because someone (in florida i believe) got a hot shrimp to the eye and sued the company.

Vif you're a hardcore fan of authentic mexican food, this is probably not the place for you.  the enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  the burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  one bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  the tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.\u000a\u000ai know, you're probably thinking "what does this girl like about mad mex?"  if you can let go of any previous mexican food experiences (or if you've never had mexican food before, as i hadn't when i first went to mad mex), some things are ok.  the tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  the california grilled salad.  the chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.\u000a\u000aadditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  they have tons of vegetarian options.  they have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  they have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.\u000a\u000aso basically: the less you know about mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  if you're a fan of authentic mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant.

Vfood is what you would expect from a bb, staff is friendly enough but the prices are outrageous.  my boyfriend and i had to endure the drive thru because we were running late for our camping trip. my "toasted" bagel was white and soft... before the addition of cream cheese. \u000a\u000aprices are crazy! \u000a\u000adon't be so lazy... drive down the hill to the ge... buy a 6 pack of bagels, cheese and some bacon for under 10 bucks!  you'll have left over food and cash

Vdelicious chinese food in a great, though sometimes cheesy, atmosphere.  rice and vegetables from sichuan house was one of my first solid foods as a child, so i may be slightly biased, but the food from sichuan house is top notch.  egg and spring rolls are both good, and the number of vegetarian options is great.  the lo mein is always perfectly cooked; the buddhist medley is full of fresh veggies and huge pieces of fried tofu.  lunch options are cheap, and if you arrive with a big enough group, you can sit in the private room in the back.  the service is always great, and the food is some of the best i've ever had.  get some take out or eat in, but definitely try sichuan house.

Vdarren's recent review of kmart got me thinking about this place. i was out this way recently and i stopped to look for a place to eat. man, talk about a dead mall! parkway center mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com i'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. back then it had chi-chi's (where thankfully i never ate. a hepatitis scare did them in), david weis, pharmor, compusa, syms, etc were all here. \u000a\u000anow the mall is mainly deserted. only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle. phantom of the attic is alive and well and so is pittsburgh sports deli. that's not an eatery either. it's a sports memorabilia store. \u000a\u000athere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch.

Vyeah, yeah, yeah, i know.  why go to the olive garden when pittsburgh has so many great local italian places?  hey, it's convenient and the food is decent.  for lunch, olive garden ain't bad in a pinch!   i had business to go to near the airport and i stopped here out of necessity.\u000a\u000ai had the basic spaghetti & meatballs in marinara sauce.  not bad.  i wish they had cups of soup 'cos the zuppa toscana was mighty tempting.  \u000a\u000aokay, so i admit i like the olive garden.  but my husband better not take me here on date night!

Vmy stylist, lacy, moved here from another salon, and i followed her.  she's great, and i wasn't about to give up on her just because she moved to a nicer salon that happens to be substantially cheaper than the old place.  for a review of lacy, please see my review of l'azur salon.\u000a\u000athe salon itself is really nice - they have a fantastic view, and lots of nice touches.  you can have coffee or tea (and cookies), and they have a nice locker system so you don't have to lug your purse to and from the styling stations.  everything seems really clean and open, and the clientele seem younger and hipper than some of the other salons i've been to.\u000a\u000aadd the bulldog that roams around, and you've got a super great experience.  they only do hair, and a tip for the new - take the elevator to get into the salon.  i like walking, and took the stairs, which actually does not lead into the salon.  they use bumble and bumble products, but are not super pushy about it.  the receptionist could use a little bit of an attitude adjustment - i swear she sighed and rolled her eyes at me when i said i didn't want my receipt.

Vi dressed up as betty draper for halloween, and needed a professional betty 'do.  hey, betty demands satisfaction!  i was able to make an appointment online, which is a big plus for me.  the stylist did a great job of giving me pin curls and incorporating the hair accessories i wanted to use.  i went back a few months later for a haircut with a different stylist.  the hair cut was fine, but i haven't been back since then.  why?  it's kinda pricey, and i feel like there's a better hair home for me.  still lookin' pittsburgh!

Vmy friend catherine came in from chicago to visit me for the weekend. after a morning at the aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the phipps conservatory. i'd never tried this place before, so i wanted to stop in. catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good! \u000a\u000aluckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard! \u000a\u000awe began our lunch by splitting an order of angry shrimp. angry shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. for my main course, the apple raspberry salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (i'm a type-1 diabetic) and i already had my carbs with the pasta. i wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and i knew i couldn't finish one. plus i didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. so i opted for a chicken cobb wrap, which was tasty enough. \u000a\u000afor the life of me, i can't remember what catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. she tried the penn pilsner beer, which she loved. i don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot. \u000a\u000aso the food here is good as is the service. but there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from chili's, houlihan's, mex & erma's, etc. and i wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers. still, it's a good place to go if you're visiting the nearby aviary, science center, the warhol, or if you're going to a steeler's or pirate's game.

Vi have been going to this place for years.  it has excellent sushi and a pretty good selection, however often they don't have all the options listed on the menu.  i'm a big fan of white tuna and they never have it.  it's a little pricey, but the quality of ingredient is excellent.  i've had two issues with this place over the 30 or so times i've been here, so that's pretty good.  try some of the specials.  if you order razor clams if they are on special be careful, because last time i had it there was a ton of sand in the clams.  this is also one of the few spots were you can get a good meal after midnight.

Vhave you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  believe me, the original fish market fits that description.  i met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (bonnie raitt) dinner and honestly i wish we'd gone someplace else.  \u000a\u000ato be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  i've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay, it was only just "okay".  there wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  nothing that made me say, "wow"!  my parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.\u000a\u000aand therein lies the problem.  the original fish market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  it certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  but the quality just doesn't match the price.

Vi was here last night for a few drinks and a couple of appetizers.  i go here about 6 or 7 times a year.  the bar itself is beautiful.  the seating is great with a huge circular bar in the middle and a lot of leather seats towards the sidewalk by the open air doors and windows.  they also have seating outside which is good for people watching especially when there is some type of event in the city.  i've found the staff to be a little above average, but nothing special.  by far the best thing about this place is the space itself and its location in the city.  the drinks are pretty good, but overpriced.  some martinis are about $10, which is fine for a stellar top shelf martini in pittsburgh or an average martini in nyc.  this is not a stellar pittsburgh martini.   i believe that any bar whether its in your basement or at the "french laundry" should have guinness on tap (just my personal belief), and this place at least has guinness but serves it out of a can.  another annoying thing is depending on who serves me i pay a different price.  last night i paid $7 for a guinness (which is way too much) and then minutes later i ordered another one from a different bartender and paid $5.25.  the food is two stars at best and very inconsistent.  they bill themselves as a "tapas" place, but it is obvious to me they don't understand what "tapas" entail.  go to ibiza on the s. side for your tapas.  some of their selections are better than others.  i've had the quail before which was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  last night i tried the ahi tuna which was of good quality, but could have used some wasabi or a stronger flavored sauce to compliment the good quality tuna.  i also tried the lobster cakes.  the lobster was barely noticable and the cakes had way too much breading.  the best thing about the plate was the curry sauce on the side.  i'd have to say that the location and space of the restaurant is 4 stars, but the food is 2 stars at best.  another weird thing is that i've been here before on more than one occassion when they simply said they were not serving food (and it was like 8 on a friday).  they need an overhaul of the chef staff.

Vjust a warning, bossa nova will close early if business is slow.  the kitchen is supposed to be open until 11 pm on weekdays, so i was shocked for them to say they are closed when i walked in the door at 9:15 pm.  but i went back again the next day and had a wonderful meal there.  i was a little disappointed that some of the traditional spanish items, such as the tortilla de patatas, were no longer on the menu.  but there are still some marvelous choices.  the scallops are always excellent, and so is the jamon asparagus.  the cranberry walnut salad is delicious and i also like the homemade spanish chorizo.  the service is attentive.  the decor is beautiful and hip.

Vso i was returning back to the office after doing a site visit and i heard the dreaded "pow!  thump-thump-thump"!  so i pulled over, got out of the car and sure enough, that right front tire was flatter than a nebraska cornfield.  o-o-k-ay!   i was so glad that years ago my brother taught me how to change a tire.\u000a\u000awell this monro was the nearest place to get the tire repaired.  it turned out i'd picked up a nail!  i've heard good and bad about auto repair chains, but they did get the tire fixed quickly.  \u000a\u000aand girls, you shouldn't be afraid of learning how to change a tire.  because i had the company car, it actually took me longer to do the memo and the expense report than it did to put the spare on

Vi had lunch here yesterday before the pirates game with a few friends.  i have also been here a few times upstairs.  i really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a seat at the bar or a table.  i usually go to the bars on the north shore prior to pirates game, but this was a lot less crowded and good for the group i was with.  in fact, truth be told the place was only about 1/2 full (on bucs opening day!?).  the food was okay.  i tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef.  i also really liked the sweet potato fries.  they were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places.  i ordered the lobster roll.  it was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold.  i can understand serving cool even though id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it.  i also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor.  the only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips.  a minor oversight i imagine.  overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends.  i've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section.  the bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches.  the happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 pm.  overall a decent place for quiet drinks without the crowds and a little better than average food.

Vwell, folks, it's a transit system.  it's job is to get you from point a to point b and pat does reasonably well at it.  i ride the 61a or the 61b (whichever comes first) to work.  my husband and i also use it when going to the pirates or penguins games or to the theater.  it's cheaper than gas and parking.

Vjojo's is the epitome of a greasy spoon diner.  we went one morning after trying to get a seat at coca cafe.  at first we were skeptical from the exterior of the place, but after walking in we were surprised to see it was completely packed and there was a line.\u000a\u000aas we were seated, i noticed lots of people were eating omelets and decided i was going to get one too.  i ended up ordering the famous jojo's omelet and an endless cup of coffee.  it had peppers, onions, mushroom, spicy sausage, american and provolone cheese as well as home fries.  the omelet itself was a giant monstrosity.  i have never seen an omelet so big before.  for a frame of reference, picture the largest calzone you've ever eaten.  it's probably bigger.  it's basically a heart attack on a palte.\u000a\u000athe omelet itself was pretty much what you'd expect.  it's just all the typical ingredients in an omelet brought together.  if you're hungover over ravenous, it's definitely the place to be.  people who think pamela's has large portions haven't seen anything yet.\u000a\u000ai hear they're open in the wee hours of the morning to cater to truckers driving through the area, so if you're out partying at one of the clubs in the strip and need food but don't want primanti's, jojo's is always available.

Vthis was a pleasant surprise and a great experience.  annie and i are at ross park mall walking around trying to figure out our lunch destination when serendipitously her phone rings and it's her dad, "brother len" calling to ask us to lunch at this hidden gem.  nice!  i prefer not to make decisions on the weekend.  next we are headed down to the strip on a relatively pleasant saturday afternoon.  the locals are out en masse and parking is at a premium.  in keeping with our serendipitous saturday theme we find prime parking right in front of kaya (another one of our favs').  we walk towards "labad's grocery".  now, i've been to this grocery before and have certainly walked by it numerous times and had never known of the little cafe located in the back of the grocery.  len's been a regular here for years and is friends with the lovely syrian family who own the joint.  we walk into the back room which is exactly what i was hoping for in that it was very small a few tables, middle eastern decorations on the wall and a cozy somewhat seperate room which had for some reason multiple stuffed animals next to the table.  there also was a sheet hanging blocking something from view and if i'm to believe len it was a camel :-).  annie and i have a seat with len who is sitting with the patriarch of this family "fayed" i believe his name is.  fayed has to leave to tend to the store and multiple operations occurring.  one of the sons is selling "shish kabob" on the sidewalk.  this is also a grocery store with sidewalk sales and of course the small cafe in the back.  i love the entrepreneurial spirit of first generation immigrants.  len orders me up some coffee.  it was a very strong version of coffee served in a tiny mug.  i'm guessing their version of espresso.  len takes care of ordering, which is good because i can't claim to be a middle eastern food connoiessur and tend to be lost after i exhaust the hummus and gyro options.  he orders us some type of platter, not sure the name of the platter itself but can describe the offerings.  i liked the metal plate that all of this food was served.  it was a large round plate sectioned off for each dip/option.  it was served with warm pita bread.  i like family style dining and this platter certainly encouraged sharing.  now, the only thing that i was familiar with was the hummus and the black olives.  the hummus was as good as any i've ever had.  it was very authentic mashed chickpeas blended with olive oil, lemon and garlic.  it was really good served with the pita chips.  the olives were really good briny small black olives served with the pit.  the other sides were baba ganoug, which is really good eggplant dip with oil, garlic and pepper.  i have tried this in the past and really didn't like it.  i really liked this, so i guess the stuff i had in the past wasn't authentic.  now, one of the two new things i had and probably my favorite was the shanklish salad, which isn't the type of salad you may be thinking of.  there was no lettuce,  but instead homemade aged cheese that is very good and delicate.  the salad also consisted of onions, tomatoes and oil.  it was great.  the final side of this dish wsa the macdoose, which i had never tried before.  it is eggplant pieces stuffed with walnuts and drowned in olive oil.  this wasn't my favorite, but i found myself however i kept eating it, so i guess i must have thought it was okay.  this would have been a great vegetarian meal (first time i've ever said that sentence) if i stopped there.  but, len also ordered me a skewer of lamb.  at first it was a bit undercooked, but one of the sons (lawrence?) grabbed it and grilled it for a few more minutes and then it was more to my liking.  i really like lamb and grilled with middle eastern seasonings is a treat with a little pita and some onions and tomatoes.  annie had a skewer of grilled chicken, which also was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  throughout the lunch we were greeted like family from other members of the family including "mama" who you just want to wrap up and take home with you.  the guy on the grill (another son can't recall name) also was very warm and friendly and had this killer "handlebar" mustache.  fayed stopped back after we were done with lunch and spent some time chatting with us.  he is a really interesting guy and a true renaissance man with vocations that have included the military, principal in school, chef amongst other things.  one of the most interesting things i found about this guy is that in spite of being a syrian christian part of his history includes teaching the koran to the bedouin (nomadic desert dwelling arab group). a couple other notes len who knows this type of food says it's the best authentic middle eastern food in pittsburgh.  next time i'm there i will definitely try the kibbee, which is spiced ground beef w/pine nuts and stuffing. it's a favorite and you can get it raw if you order in advance.  that would be adventorous.

Vok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  that's what primanti's is.  it's a compact, greasy pittsburgh right.  \u000a\u000ayes, the place is small, it is in market square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted primanti's and no more market square location?  i know i would.  if i were in the downtown region and had that craving i wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the strip just for a bite of that pittsburgh goodness.  \u000a\u000athe 'it's a pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  if you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'manliest restaurant in america,'  i think that means it's more than just a pittsburgh thing.  why else would primanti's be featured on such media?  why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a primanti's?  i mean that has to show you it's more than just a pittsburgh thing.\u000a\u000aand 'it's so greasy?'  did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of italian bread.  \u000a\u000abetter yet, move out of my way, i'm about to chow down on that pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention.

Vmonte cello's downtown does not look like much from the outside.  it is wedged into a small triangular shaped building.  they are open for lunch and dinner.  their pizza has been a staple of downtown since 1980.\u000a\u000atheir specialty pizzas include spinach and feta cheese pizza, a little too oily for my tastes (it's made with an oil and garlic sauce).  a much better choice is buffalo chicken pizza, which is buffalo sauce topped with cheese and spicy chicken.  the chicken has a nice fresh taste to it and while spicy, is never overdone.\u000a\u000abut i love the hoagies the best here.  my favorite is the tuna hoagie, which is served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, & grilled onions.  i know, break out the listerine strips after eating one of those.  if i like something a little zestier, i'll get the capicola or the genoa salami hoagie.\u000a\u000athey have a lunch buffet here too.  i've never tried it because i prefer my food made-to-order.

Vit's been awhile since i've reviewed monte cello's so i thought i'd hit it again yesterday.  monte cello's in a rather unassuming building.  it's a little cramped in there and definitely not the most inviting place in the world.  but yesterday was one of those picture perfect summer days--perfect for getting a good sandwich or slice and heading over to a plaza for some al fresco dining (unfortunately al fresco called in sick so i had to eat alone).\u000a\u000aso let's see, which sandwich did i want?  philly chicken hoagie?  capicola hoagie?  grilled chicken?  nah, the genoa salami hoagie seemed just right.  \u000a\u000athe food here is pretty good.  but you're always better off getting it to go.

Varen't there times when a good solid three star performer really fills the bill?  o'believe me it does!  i've been out of town for two weeks on business (san antonio) and it feels so good to come home to the basics.\u000a\u000ai got a mini 4-cut pizza with pepperoni, capicola, and roasted red peppers on it.  i could only eat half of it, so i took the other half home for my husband.  my pizza really hit the spot.\u000a\u000aso for me, three stars doesn't mean the place is mediocre.  it simply means the place does the basics very well and they're good, solid, dependable performers.

Vthe only place where i can get my taco fix while i'm in pittsburgh?  legit.  i always get two lengua tacos.  lengua is spanish for delicious, so that's why i always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually spanish for tongue, but i find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).\u000a\u000atake a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but i guess the pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  the customer is always right.\u000a\u000aat 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what i'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the strip, it's priced just right.\u000a\u000athey also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some lenguaaaa.

Vnever had food from their taco stand (but it looks super delish), but i have been to the grocery store a few times now, and i dig it.\u000a\u000aone of the major bummers about moving from chicago to pittsburgh was the total lack of a significant latino population.  from wikipedia: latinos make up about 25% of the chi-town population....about 2% of the pittsburgh population.  wah wah waaaaaah (sad trombone.  sad mariachi band?)\u000a\u000aso the lack of authentic latino ingredients has been a huge bummer.  where's a girl supposed to get a taco around here?  this is why i was so happy to find reyna.  in my home kitchen, we tend to cook lots of asian and indian food, but when we do go the latin america route, we want to do it right.  homemade style.  so a place with fresh tortillas, mexican cheeses, bulk dried peppers, jumex (boyfriend is obsessed with these canned juices/nectars), and other tasty things is a much-needed addition to the strip, with its diverse culinary offerings.\u000a\u000ai will always return here for latin american ingredients - partially because reyna is great, but also because - where else could you get that around here?  i do wish reyna was bigger, but i shouldn't complain.

Vi've been to the taco stand now!  yaaaaaaaaaaay!  on our way out of town for the holidays, we needed a quick snackie and made a stop at reyna's for taco deliciousness.  we got four - two chicken, chorizo, carrnitas.  yum.  they were so fun to eat - messy, sitting in our car, hot sauce dripping down our fingers - who doesn't love street food?  seriously, this is the only place i've laid eyes on in pittsburgh that appears to sell tacos of this kind.  i kind of want to go back....like, now.\u000a\u000aoh but wait.  stop.  the churros.  on a whim, i ordered some churros real quick, and watched the guy pour the batter into hot oil right before my very eyes.  they floated around, browning and sizzling, then he took them out and put them directly into cinnamon sugar, into a paper plate thing, and then into my hands.  they were the best churros ever.  love at first bite.  love just watching them sizzle! \u000a\u000ai think i want to try empanadas next time if i can tear myself away from the tacos.

Vi love mexican food and the only thing i love more than eating mexican is cooking mexican! reyna's has absolutely everything you need to have your own south of the border fiesta! salsa, mole, hot sauces galore, fresh guacamole, dried chilies, house made frozen goods, kitchen gadgets, candles, spices...oh, i could go on.\u000a\u000aon my most recent trip i knew i wasn't going to have a lot of time to make dinner from scratch so i grabbed some southwestern vegetarian tamales (made in-house and frozen $8.50/5) guac and some tortilla chips. all i had to do was heat and serve. jb raved about the meal and i almost didn't want to tell him it was premade and all i had to do was heat it up and make it look pretty on the plate, but i have to give credit where credit is due.\u000a\u000arenya foods is fabulous and if you are a lover of mexican food, you have to drop in. you will not leave empty handed.

Vthis is a great summertime place.  i have been going to rolands since i turned 21 a decade ago.   the beer selection is one of the best in pittsburgh if not the best.  and, i agree with jason p. in that the best sandwich in the burgh is the lobster roll.  i prefer the cold lobster roll as opposed to the hot, but they are both awesome.  it's a very generous portion of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  they have a very good raw bar with oysters, shrimp, crab and other goodies.  the outdoor seating is awesome.  sit upstairs and look at the passerby's on the street at the strip.  saturday's and sunday's afternoon are the best time to visit.  the pizza is also pretty good, brick oven and thin crust.  the seafood stew is a great deal for about $15 you get a delicious broth and lots of fish and shellfish.  the bartenders are great.  it's pretty well known that john the irish guy is the best bartender in the burgh', however i think he only works one day a week now.  bo is very good and my buddy jeff is also a good tender.   they have pool tables and darts, so plenty of bar games.  the only reason i don't give this place four stars is that they don't have all the top shelf liquor that my heart desires.  they have new management since my buddy rick went to bettis bar.  and, they are lacking in some liquor selections since.  they don't have patron or any top shelf rum.  i ordered a top shelf long island iced tea yesterday and was disappointed to taste cuervo instead of petrone.   however, overall the place is a good time and a must visit in pittsburgh.  get the lobster roll!

Vwe spent a few hours here on the day of the st. patrick's day parade, and had a great time.  the space is pretty large, with indoor and outdoor seating.  they have something like 500 beers; a major plus! we sat upstairs, and because the kegs are kept in the basement, they can't get beer all the way up there.  that means you have to order bottled beer from the waitress but can go downstairs and order draft beers.  that's sort of weird.  anywho-- i had a caesar salad and french onion soup.  both were tasty, and the other people in my party liked their food too-- pizza and burgers.  the waitress was super friendly.  i'd like to go back and enjoy their upstairs patio & a lobster roll!

Vmy husband rick likes this store for his business wear and some of his sports wear.  he likes that there are salespeople here who actually wait on him, fit him, and make recommendations.  he also likes the dress shoes here.\u000a\u000awe bought his last suit here on sale.  it was originally $550.00, on sale for $199.00.  and i gotta tell ya, it fits him so well and looks so good on him!  i love being seen with my guy when he's wearing that suit!  \u000a\u000ai work pretty close to the downtown location, and since they're having a sale, he asked me to pick up a couple of dress shirts for him.  the salesman  there helped me pick out a couple of shirts that would go well with his suit.\u000a\u000ayes, jos. a. bank's is a little more expensive than many places.  indeed, it is quite a bit more expensive than target or walmart.  y'know what though?  you get what you pay for, and my guy is one of those who'd rather pay a little more and get clothes that look good on him, especially for business.  he's one of those guys who wants his clothes to be well made and to last.

Vwhether you are a serious coffee drinker, or you know someone who is, this is the perfect place to buy bulk coffee.  and if you do have a good friend or relative who loves coffee, this is the best place to get a distinctive gift for that person.\u000a\u000anicholas coffee company has been around a long time, since 1919 actually.  one  thing that makes their coffee so good is that they roast them on the premises.  you can really taste the difference versus getting bulk coffee at starbucks or dunkin' donuts.  some of my favorite blends include the ethiopian harrar, costa rican tarrazu, and if in the mood for something a little stronger and darker, i recommend the french roast.  they have their private blends too.\u000a\u000ai'm not into tea as much, although i'll buy here in the summer to make ice tea.  and they do sell chinese restaurant tea, which rick and i love to brew when we order chinese take-out.  they also have a lot of boxed teas and gift teas for the tea lover in your life.  want to know what "china gunpowder temple of heaven" is?  http://www.nicholascoffee.net/webstore/storefront/itembuy.cfm?itemid=451\u000a\u000athey also have a lot of teapots and coffee makers if you are looking for a nice gift for someone.  and how many coffee roasters sell cigars?  my confession:  i've smoked cigars on rare occasion and i actually do like the mild ones!  one last thing, their website http://www.nicholascoffee.net/webstore/storefront/storemain.cfm?cfid=4407284&cftoken=92186416 is very good and it has a lot of good tips on brewing good coffee and tea.

Vwith the return of nice weather to the'burgh, i've been able to get out on lunch and do some shopping.  i took a stroll down here 'cos it felt good to get out of the office and besides, i'm getting a little tired of the coffee from giant eagle.  maxwell house and folger's are okay, but soemtimes we need a little variety.\u000a\u000aso i picked up some olde vienna which is a little darker than most american roasts, but not as dark as french roast.  i also picked up a nice kenya aa blend.  but i'm also become a tea lover and i picked up some stash decaffeinated earl grey--makes a great ice tea!  great coffee and service here.  it's been a few years since i was here last and i'm gonna have to stop by more often.

Vgood coffee and reasonable prices.  they have a large selection of fresh roasted coffees and teas to bring home, and a coffee bar where you can order drinks.\u000a\u000ai tried the "chubby bunny" latte--white chocolate and toasted marshmallow--wasn't a fan, but i acknowledge that it's my own fault for ordering something so sweet!  husband had an americano, black, which was delish.  this place smells like heaven...i'll definitely come back, although i'll probably just do my usual brewed coffee. \u000a\u000athey also had a "bargain bin" of ritter sport chocolate bars for $1.30 each by the door...lucky i saw them on the way out instead of the way in!

Vsalonika is a popular place judging by the crowds they get in here.  the ambiance here isn't the greatest so it's definitely a place to get takeout chow.  \u000athe basic menu here won't surprise you any.  it's your basic gyros, sandwiches, salads, hoagies, paninis, etc.  i went for the chicken gyro and it was pretty tasty. they've got a few specialties here including \u000ayouvetsi and mousaka.  they've got your basic sides too, but if i ever get back here i'm gonna try the lemon potatoes.  \u000a\u000aso it pretty much looks like an old reliable type of place and i'll bet most of the people i saw were regulars.

Vthe food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  the service is quick and the prices are reasonable for downtown.  they are open late hours, so sometimes that can be handy.  there are better places for greek food, but salonika's is often close by.

Vwhenever i forget my lunch like today, brown bag deli is usually my first choice for lunch.  the sandwiches are above average quality (ie. they taste like they have been made today).   my favorite is a roast beef sandwich on wheat bread.  they do have a good selection of sides, which is important to me.  i have type-1 diabetes, so i can choose according to my needs.  they also have catering available.

Vagain, i forgot my lunch today!  when that happens, this is my "go to" place.  i guess that's because it's right across the street from work and it was a crummy day outside.  otherwise, i would have had a taste for something different.\u000a\u000astill, not a bad roast beef sandwich.

Vi know it's been awhile since i'd last reviewed brown bag deli--almost three years in fact.  it used to be my "go to" place when i left my lunch at home.\u000a\u000aanyway, brown bag deli has become known for their catering.  we decided to have an employee luncheon today and bbd had the best price.  we did the traditional deli tray, which for $5.50 per person ain't a bad deal.  it included lunch meats. cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, breadworks' breads, and kosher dill pickles.  check 'em out if you need catering.

Vmy husband and i took our niece and nephew to the nearby john heinz history center this past saturday.  we decided to stop for lunch here.  normally when my husband and i think "italian",  we think of a fine trattoria or an old-school place like minutello's (we're childless).  but when little ones are in tow, it's always best to stop at a kid-friendly place like this.  \u000a\u000aso how is it?  pretty good actually.  about what you'd get at one of olive garden's better locations.   i opted for the penne pasta with italian sausage and peppers and onions.  i forget what my husband had, but mine was good, although i wish their lunch menu was available on saturdays (i would have prefferred a sandwich and soup).  \u000a\u000abut they have a good kid's menu here, so that's why we stopped.  kids can get a pasta or pizza meal for $3.99.  they really seemed to like it and their portions were just right.\u000a\u000athey also have a fairly extensive beer and wine list here.  i'm a non-drinker but my husband rick enjoyed a good italian beer, peroni, on tap.  \u000a\u000athing about pasta places like this is that since i'm a type-1 diabetic, the insulin i have to take to cover a meal like this.  well that, and add the tiramisu i had for dessert (o the glorious carbs--pump that insulin, susan, pump).  so yeah, while it is a chain, spaghetti warehouse isn't a bad choice, especially if the little ones are along.

V.jb's parents wanted to meet here for dinner, i wasn't all that thrilled but i went for them. i guess i was a little hard on sw the first time around, the food isn't bad, i just think it's overrated. on this trip we got an appetizer sampler - fried mozz and zucchinii were nothing special, the brushetta was superb and i didn't get to taste the fried ravoli but i didn't hear any complaints from the table. as an entree i had the 4 cheese manicotti which comes with both marinara and alfredo, the dish was good but im not really a fan of their marinara so if i ever find myself revisiting the sw i'll ask for just alfredo. everyone else at the table had some form of lasagna (veggie, sausage and meat) and again, no complaints. overall, its a decent family restaurant.

Vi know it's a chain restaurant, but i loved the food and the atmosphere.  maybe i love the kitchy?\u000a\u000awe arrived before the dinner rush and were promplty seated and our waitress was at our table.  she took our drink orders and then disappeared for a bit to let us look over the menus.  when she arrived with our drinks we placed an appetizer order and she disappeared again.  this time when she returned she was empty handed and took our orders for our entrees.\u000a\u000aa little slide downhill here.  a salad/soup comes with the entree.  weird thing is, we received our salads way before our appetizer, yeah, the thing we ordered first.  while we were eating our salads the appetizer finally came out...wrong.  what we had oredred was not what we recieved.  all that wait and we don't even get the right thing.  we informed the waitress, and instead of taking it back, she just brought us what was missing.  the food finally comes out, correctly this time.  we munch away and then the manager pops up to inquire how we were doing.  we say fine and ask for a box to put what we couldn't finish.\u000a\u000atime to pay and it's a bit of a cluster here because we asked to have the check split.  things showed up on reversed receipts, but all is good in the end.  will i come back here, yes, but will i remember it's here, probably, but only if i drive by it again.

Vreally marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  the gift shop is one of the best in the city.  they feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  shows are well lit and well presented.  downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). they do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers.

Vthere is nothing really to complain about here.  this mortons is like most in other cities.  it's definitely for the expense account crowd.  it's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  i've been to mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  it's like most other high end chain steakhouses (palm, ruth's, capital grille, etc.).  the bar is pretty lame, but i'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  capital grille or hyde park bar is much better for bar scene.  but, one thing i definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  if you've never been to mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the prime cheeseburger trio or the filet sandwiches for only 6 dollars.  plus, the fries are awesome.  the dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  the service is awesome because i'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  the food is great.  however, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  i eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  stay away from the filet.  i mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  i'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  get the cajun ribeye.  i can't remember if pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do i would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  i also suggest getting the "lazy" lobster.  there are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  it's pure indulgence.  the asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  the spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  you should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  i wish the bar was better, because if it was i'd go here more often.  this place is exactly what you would expect.  and, that's a good thing.

Vfor my boyfriend's birthday earlier this week, he told me that he wanted steak for dinner.  steak he wants, steak he gets!  we did a little bit of research about where to get a great piece of meat in pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check out morton's.  we'd heard of it from chicago, and it definitely has a good reputation there too.\u000a\u000aso we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a tuesday.  the hostess greeted us warmly, and led us into the dimly lit room to our booth.  i had told them on opentable that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  and wow, somebody told him "happy birthday!" every 15 minutes!  they all knew about it!  our menus actually had "happy 28th birthday, taylor!" printed on them.  my mom had pre-ordered sparkling wine, which was waiting for us on ice when we arrived.  the sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  after we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  five minutes later, she came back with a print out of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  wowza!\u000a\u000awe felt unbelievably welcomed.  we helped ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us about the various menu offerings.  it's a little funny how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  it does give you a nice visual for the steaks, but it's a little funny for....asparagus.  still, seeing the size of the meat helped us make our choice.\u000a\u000afirst, we got the onion soup and the caesar salad.  the onion soup was served bubbling hot, with a layer of cheese baked on top, of course.  it was very tasty - not the best i've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot for two hungry people!  something about the broth was a bit too sweet perhaps.  the caesar was great - they knew we were splitting it so they served it on two perfectly portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic caesar.  you know they made this dressing perfectly - can't leave out the anchovy!  delicious.\u000a\u000awe each got the bone-in ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful.  the meat was pretty marbled, but the fat was so succulent that honestly i ate every bite of it.  the meat needs no sauce - just that luscious char on top and warm tender beef within.  fantastic.  loved every bite.  our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  but that didn't stop us from loving our wonderful dinner!\u000a\u000amom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic chocolate cake and the creme brulee.  i didn't taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly rich and decadent.  i loved the creme brulee, and somehow finished every bite despite being stuffed already.\u000a\u000aservice was always friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and truly i felt like we were royalty.  come here on a special occasion, and you'll see what i mean.  it is a very expensive place to eat, but totally worth it for a special occasion.  with prices that high, you deserve to feel like their most cherished patrons of all time, and we certainly did.  i would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate and want to have a big steak at the same time!

Vgreat place for date night or any other special occasion.\u000a\u000amorton's without a doubt is my favorite upscale pittsburgh steakhouse. the service is impeccable and the food is second to none.\u000a\u000aduring this visit i took my wife for a romantic dinner for valentine's day. we were early for our reservation so we headed to the bar for some "bar bites until it was time to be seated at our booth. once seated ed was our server and he was great! he brought over the "meat cart" with all of the different cuts of steak that they offered and went over each steak. the cart also has all of the vegetables they offer as well.\u000a\u000awe both started off with a few cocktails. i had the french raspberry mortini and she had the chocolatini mortini. by this time the huge loaf of onion bread was brought and placed on our table. next we both had salads. i had the caesar and she had the wedge. for our steaks we both had the single cut fillet cooked cajun style which were seasoned and cooked to perfection. absolutely the best, most tender steak i have ever eaten in my life. it was like steak flavored butter. it melted in your mouth. i added a utterly amazing crab cake to mine and she added colossal shrimp to hers. to accompany our entrees i added garlic mashed potatoes to mine and the wife added green beans to hers.\u000a\u000afor dessert we shared the world famous morton's lava chocolate cake with ice cream. what a way to end one of the best meals we have ever had.

Vthis au bon pain is pretty much like any other au bon pain you'll find from philadelphia international airport to the chicago loop.  you'll pretty much find the same sandwiches, the same bagels, & the same soups no matter which one you go to.  \u000a\u000abut i like their coffee here (seriously, is there a cup of coffee out there that susan d. does not like?) and on nice days, i like getting a sandwich to go.  i'll take it over to one of the nearby plazas & dine al fresco.

Vyou mean i can have a nice pecan roll--all 740 calories, 85 grams of carbs, & 48 grams of sugar of it?  whoo-hoo!  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!\u000a\u000aactually i didn't get that calorie bomb.  i came here for lunch today with a co-worker and had a somewhat more sane chicken salad sandwich.  my sandwich was good, but was about the same as any at abp, panera bread, etc.

Vi really like this saks. it's close to my job so i am in there all the time! \u000a\u000aantoine takes care of me with my clothing purchases every time i am there. tom is my guy for bond no.9. he sends out postcards telling me about new bond fragrances and in store bond events all the time. he always is hooking me up with a free sample when i come in! reshonda is my girl for all other fragrances. if i want to try something and they don't have a sample she will make me one right on the spot! now that's service! \u000a\u000ai would give the store a 5 put the interior sucks! it is too small and needs a major updating. it looks like kaufmann's, gimbel's or horne's from back in the 80's. the fragrance counter is too small. the men's section is down in the basement and only half of the floor is men's. the rest is house ware. the majority of the men's section is suits. can we get some gucci or prada clothing not just shoes? they really need to expand or move across the street to the old lord & taylor building!

Vi think someone at sak's corporate read my last review. they have rearranged and updated the men's floor! they moved the shoes to a more open and flowing location. they have also taken out the house ware section and have converted it into a hugo boss section that is huge! louis vuitton is now gone as of january 31, 2010 and was replace by a handbag wall. they left because sak's wouldn't update their area. i am so sad to see them leave! they have a stand alone store in near by ross park mall.\u000a\u000anow if only they could redo the whole store.

Vthis review isn't for the opera, this is for the venue space.\u000a\u000aattended a wedding reception here and had more than a wonderful time.  the space is more than adequate to house all of your guests in a comfortable setting.  the staff made this run as smoothly as possible (even though an opera is no wedding i'm sure a wedding could be an opera).  the sound system was amazing and more than enough for a wedding.  \u000a\u000athe building i have to say was quite beautiful.  exposed brick all over the place.  great reuse of a building and quite unique i have to say.  parking to attend anything here i would imagine is hard to find seeing that it is in the strip district.  but once you find your spot and walk into the building you definitely know you're in for a good time.

Vi have been a subscriber to the pittsburgh opera for 5 years.  i have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably new york city and sidney, and i feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in pittsburgh.  the season usually provides lots of variety, and the artistic standards are very high.  the benedum itself is a magnificent venue to attend an opera, they have done a wonderful job restoring this historic building.  the acoustics of the benedum are also really excellent.  the super titles are easy to read from just about any seat.  the orchestra is well rehearsed and play beautifully.  i also think that most people have  misconceptions about opera which can be easily be proved wrong by visiting the pittsburgh opera.

Vprobably the best, most thorough chinese supermarket you'll find in pittsburgh. they have most of your chinese grocery needs at pretty decent prices. they even have the staple unfriendly cashiers. some, not all; just enough to fill the expectation. if you're an asian american transplant from a bigger city, you'll appreciate having lotus foods in da burgh.

Vwho knew one could purchase so many different varieties of tofu? in addition to the usual silken, firm, extra firm, here you find spiced, aged, and flavored. all sorts of bean curd and noodles await you at lotus foods. the seletion here is magnificent, though the past few times i've gone their produce has been wilted and shriveled. mostly all of the products have chinese only packaging so if you don't know what it is, try to find an english speaking employee which is most of the time easier said then done.

Vwhat irks me about this place is the rudeness.  i know this place is located in the strip and it's suppose to be fast paced and all, but be polite to me if you intend for me to return.\u000a\u000ai will admit i did find some decent buys for the items i needed while in here, but had no idea where to find anything.  i roamed the aisles until i stumbled upon what i needed.  however, when i did find exactly what i needed, i had to wait for a congregation of people having their sunday chat on a thursday to move.  when i am in this type of situation i become very irritated very easily.\u000a\u000aalso be sure to spend at least $5 or else be prepared to be told off at checkout.  that's the cherry on top of the rudeness cake.  not quite sure the reasoning behind this action.  you're getting my money either way.

Vi can't believe no one has written a review here yet on the good ol' smithfield cafe!  maybe it's because it's been around so long and has been such a good ol' reliable that everyone just takes it for granted.  i guess i'm guilty of that too.  it's been a long while since i've eaten here.\u000a\u000abut this place has been here many years.  it looks like it's still caught in some kind of time-warp.  they have maroon bar stools, yellow walls, wood paneling, red drop-down ceiling, green floor tiles.  its menu is strictly the beef sandwich-n-beer type and they still serve their traditional cobb salad or devonshire sandwich.\u000a\u000ai was here last night with some co-workers.  we were celebrating someone's birthday.  as i said, i haven't eaten here in awhile and i don't drink.  so i don't know how the alky-holic beverages are.  but everyone else seemed to be enjoying the booze.  and the atmosphere here is still old-school great.  well next week i'll have to hit it up for lunch.

Vit's been a crazy week in my office, what with it being the end of our fiscal year and all.  so i just had to get me out and have me some good old comfort food for lunch today.  alone!\u000a\u000aso i had me a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries with some coleslaw.  it really hit the spot so i'm upping my rating to four stars.

Vbad idea:  being floor supervisor at work while hopped up on extra caffeine.  \u000agood idea:  if you are going to put up with a ton of aggravation while totally wired, might as well do so with totally great coffee.

Vi've been in pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that i love eating in pittsburgh. i'm from nyc, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. i just really think that pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. i am a serious advocate of dining in pittsburgh, and i take pride in knowing the good places to eat. there, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. \u000a\u000aso take this to heart: andy's sushi bar (located in wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in pittsburgh. now, a few caveats: it is not a restaurant, it is a stand inside wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders only. you will not get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. this sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. you could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. he's fast, but his line can get long. \u000a\u000atake it for what it is: andy uses fresh and tasty fish. he cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. he will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. he does have a limited selection of sushi/sashimi platters. he has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the "chef's special" -- he just loads up a roll for you. you won't be disappointed.\u000a\u000aand, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.

Vhello, my name is neal and i'm an alcoho... sushi addict.  this is one of my favorite places for sushi in pittsburgh.  i've never ordered anything off the menu, but sushi....err... sashimi actually.  i really like the sushi chefs here.  they are friendly and when they know you are a regular they tend to be very generous.  i probably go here a couple of times per month,, usually on saturday afternoons.  the fish is always very fresh.  a prime example of this is yesterday i tried to order a type of clam, but mr. kim said it wasn't as fresh as he'd like to serve.  my favorite is  white tuna.   the miso soup is actually surprisingly good.  i really like the location of the restaurant and all of the servers are well trained.  sit at the sushi bar where you can see the artists at work.  also, please don't forget to tip the sushi chef.  these guys are pros.  eat with your hands, sushi is the original finger food.

Va group of friends and i went to try out the korean bbq. apparently that is only available on the weekends, so be warned. we started off a bit on the wrong foot, because we had made reservations in advance, only to be told when we got there that another, larger party had booked out the upstairs bbq area, so they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. after staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.\u000a\u000aso, having had korean bbq in both new york and san francisco, i can't say that i thought this was the best experience. the kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. if you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. you can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. the chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. as one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from trader joe's is better than what we had here.\u000a\u000aif you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. it's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though i'm not sounding like i had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves. but don't go thinking that you are going to have the culinary experience of your life.

Vthis is my second year as a subscriber.  i've seen some really excellent productions here, especially red and superior donuts.  i like that the stage harkens back to shakespeare, the "theatre in the round" concept.  i recommend you try the "mix at 6," as a way of introducing yourself to the public, then consider becoming a subscriber.  the seating is very good, one can hear and see well from everywhere in the theater. customer service has been very good when i have needed to exchange my tickets for another night.  i also recommend the preview night, where ted pappas introduces the upcoming season.  this is a reasonably priced event that will get you excited about the new season of plays.

Vi remember back circa 1991 when i was a freshman in high school, everybody read in pittsburgh.  it was the free weekly newspaper and it had the concerts, comic strips, and news features that the post gazette and the tribune review would not touch.  somewhere along the line, probably when i was a junior or so, the new kid pittsburgh city paper came along.  i didn't think it would survive.  after all, pittsburgh didn't need two of the same thing.\u000a\u000awell, i was wrong.  in pittsburgh is no more and the pittsburgh city paper is the source for alternative news and such that in pittsburgh used to provide.  i was never one for the news that these types of papers provide.  i like to read city paper's take on things.  but these papers are best for concert reviews, happenings around town, and movie reviews.

Vi love the location, and i keep trying to give redfin blues a chance, but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  the setting is fabulous, there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  i still enjoy eating here on occasion, but i always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  maybe one day that will change.

Vwe ordered from villa reale after a long supervisor's meeting this morning.  villa reale is primarily a pizza joint, but we ordered sandwiches figuring to each his own.\u000a\u000ai'd read very mixed reviews of villa reale so i was a little hesitant about ordering from here.  but my 6" italian hoagie was as good as any i've had from any other downtown place like monte cello's.

Vwell folks, it looks like the end of this bee-yoo-tee-full october weather we've been having is nigh!  tomorrow brings the cooler, more rainy weather we'd been so accustomed to before this autumnal respite.  i had one last chance to dine al fresco today.\u000a\u000aso which type of fare would be best for outdoor dining?  hotdogs?  nah, i'd already done that.  hoagies?   hey, now we're talkin'!  mmmm!  to quote adam sandler, "hoagies-n-grinders, hoagies-n-grinders" (but no navy beans, navy beans!).  villa reale may be a typical downtown pizza shop, but they've got good hoagies here.  i went for the 6" pepperoni topped lettuce, tomato, onions & cheese and a brewed ice tea.  it was the perfect way to end a season of outdoor lunches.

Vthe steaks here are very good.  it's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  however, i love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  that's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  i love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  i had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  the  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  it's kind of an afterthought it seems.  oh yeah, and they don't have guiness on tap.  i'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  i mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  if you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  the service is very good.  the crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  the mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but i think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  overall a very fine experience.  i'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners mortons, capital grille,  ruth chris, hyde park.  and, for bar area and bar dining capital grille, hyde park, mortons, ruth chris.

Vi read an article recently in the post-gazette that says to wring the most wear out of what they own, people are visiting auto mechanics, cobblers, tailors and computer repair experts as they haven't in years.  i believe it.  business at ullrich's has been good recently, especially since they moved into their present location.  ullrich's has been around in one form or another for over 80 years and a couple of years ago they moved to their present location.\u000a\u000aullrich's offers a full line of services including shoe and purse repair, desalt and waterproofing, and jacket and zipper repair.  can't make it into their store?  you can even send your shoes to be repaired via mail!  no, really!  check it out!    http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/mailorder.htm\u000a\u000aanyway, my husband rick asked me to drop off his shoes to get them resoled here.  i just picked them up on lunch a few minutes ago and they look practically new.  he had me drop off his leather jacket to have a tear repaired last year and they did a fantastic job.  i've had one of my purses repaired here too.  we've always been satisfied with their work.  \u000a\u000ait's so good to see people renovate and repair rather than throw out.  rick and i have been doing that for years.

Vhey, they linked to my review on their website!   just click on news & links and then on customer review http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/newslinks.htm  like steve martin in "the jerk" when he finds his name in the phone book, i guess i'm somebody now!  \u000a\u000aall kidding aside, ullrich's came in handy last week.  i broke a heel and they did a great job repairing it.  they've resoled rick's shoes, repaired a tear in his leather jacket, and repaired one of my purses.  we've always been happy with their work.

Vthis was a really pleasant surprise.  the normal friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  she was going to be nice enough to go to "dish" although i know it's not one of her favs'.  mantini's also came across the radar screen.  however, i wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly.  annie's mom gave us an "entertainment" book for christmas and papa j's was listed as an option.  i checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic.  unlike its sister restaurant in carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu.  i'm guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour.  i called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes (note to restaurant please update your website, you don't even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location).  we decided to check it out after calling her brother lee who goes often.  we get there around 730 pm last night (friday).  upon entering the extremely old (classic) building i'm struck by the interior which is truly "old school".  it's dark wood, exposed brick, ornate lighting and the like...  there are a group of regulars i'd guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly.  the bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two.  we are then greeted by a friendly gal (jj) who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons.  annie confirms with jj that we can use the entertainment card, she confirms and we save 12 bucks.  she brings us over some decent bread, unfortunately not served warm.  the bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix.  she left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch.  annie started with the wedding soup which was okay, but not memorable.  i tried the potato soup, which was pretty tasty although a little bland.  annie then ordered the chicken romano which was really good.  the chicken wasn't too "eggy" and the coating was almost light which is hard to accomplish with this dish.  in addition the portion size was pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all.  they also accommodated her request to have thin spaghetti for the pasta and serve with alfredo sauce, which they did for a dollar more.  the whole dish i think was $15.  i ordered the salmon with green beans.  it was a reasonable portion of fish cooked well.  the green beans were crisp and fresh.  the salmon was served on a chipotle pesto.  i found the pesto a bit overpowering and could have skipped it altogether, but if it did need to be served on pesto i would have preferred a traditional style pesto.  service was spot on from start to finish.  i think jj's family owns the restaurant.  we inquired about the rumors of the place being haunted and the former incarnations of this place being a brothel.  jj took us down to the basement and showed us the underground tunnels that used to be used for the local politicians to make their way to the brothel unnoticed.  she also took us upstairs and showed us the madame's bedroom (incidentally the headboard of the madame's bed is now the bar downstairs (i took a picture and posted).  the whole meal with a couple of martinis was only $45 after the entertainment card discount not including tip.  and, we both had leftovers.  we stopped at the bar for a nightcap after dinner and the bartender said they are redesigning the menu and trying hard to make this more of a dinner spot than just happy hour.  there was also a band setting up as we left.  it seems like they are trying hard and i intend to be back.  however, be warned if you're looking for a hip happening spot a la "tamari" this probably isn't it.  but, if you're looking for decent (3 star) food, great value and service you could do a lot worse.  i'll be back.

Vi can't find a complaint about this place.  drinks are reasonable.  only ever seems to be a $1 cover.  couches for lounging.  pool table.  room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to).\u000a\u000astaff is super friendly.  during pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside.

Vhold up, time for an update on the review.  still five stars, yes, but let me expand on it more than my two tiny paragraphs i had prior.\u000a\u000asince i was there last they have done a remodel, a great remodel.  it doesn't feel so enclosed now.  amazing what a bright color of paint on the wall and some new flooring can do for the way a place feels inside.  also, big props for finally getting rid of the blinds on the only windows you have in the place (i have a feeling you used them to hide your embarrassment).  new floors and paint are not the only thing that was done for this remodel.  remember those scary bathrooms?  yeah, no more.  they have nice, clean bathrooms now.  the one thing that baffles me is the sink outside the bathrooms.  one sink.  between the men's and women's bathroom.  air dryer, no towels...weird, but it works.\u000a\u000aanother great thing was that they moved the pool table to the back.  to me, it felt like they were deterring you from entering on some nights.  i mean what would you think if you walked into a dim lit bar and saw some guys standing there with pool cues?  with the moving of the pool table, it really does open it up at the front, more inviting if you will.\u000a\u000astaff are still as nice as can be.  polite and accommodating.\u000a\u000a$1 cover on most nights to walk in the door.  yes there is a $10 minimum if you want to use  your card.\u000a\u000a*if you like karaoke, they have an odd little twist on it every first thursday of the month.

Vholy.  crap.\u000a\u000ai had never been in mon aimee before, not being a big sweet-tooth person, but when i was in the strip last saturday i stopped in.  my boyfriend and his mom do enjoy the chocolate, and i have to admit i was sucked in by the promise of "lavender sea salt caramels" on a chalkboard outside.\u000a\u000ai was really amazed when i walked in.  it's just.....chocolate, as far as you can see.  gourmet, imported chocolate.  and some other types of candy as well, in old fashioned glass jars, or artfully displayed on a table.  candy from asia, candy from britain.  chocolate from europe, south america, africa.  some of the bars looked incredible - some were priced at $15 or more, which totally blew my mind.  they had an intriguing section near the front devoted to baking chocolate, with chips, whole bars, and cool things like butterscotch and white chocolate baking pieces.  they also have gelato, and some unwrapped candies that look fresh made, behind a front counter.\u000a\u000awe bought the aforementioned lavender sea salt caramels, and a few other bars.  it's a pretty pricey store, but it was clearly an incredible place that any chocolate fan should explore.  it's hard for me to judge since candy is not my favorite, but i enjoyed what i tried.  the caramels were coated in dark chocolate and did have a really interesting, herbal quality from the lavender.  i also tried an irish whiskey truffle bar that my boyfriend got - i don't care much for dark chocolate so it was too rich for me, but i liked the creamy center.\u000a\u000adefinitely for the chocolate fan - especially if you like dark chocolate, they have countless varieties of it.  next time i stop in, i'll be sure to try the "peanut butter heaven," since that sounds right up my alley!

Vstan's has great prices outside mostly because they things they have prepacked are spoiled and moldy or will be tomorrow.  inside is just average quality, equally average priced produce.

Vthe strip disappoints me in the produce department.  this is definitely *the* place to go for produce, but it's really nothing terribly special.  yes, the prices are great, but the quality is hit-or-miss.  i've gotten some absolutely great deals, but i've also had experiences where the veggies are past their prime, and aren't worth the low cost.  also, not a big fan of everything being prepacked in styrofoam flat containers.  and since everything is just sitting out, some of the veggies can seem a little wilted on warm days.  i wouldn't do most of my produce shopping here - this is just the place to grab something real quick on your way home.  i hate to say it - but go to whole foods or market district (or real farmer's markets, in summer) for your major produce needs.  stop at stan's on the way home from penn mac if you just want a head of lettuce real quick.

Vcheap, everyone seems to say that.  and it's true.  but i wasn't feeling it here.\u000a\u000ai for one did not want to dig through the dirty to find the golden product.  i know it's in the strip, but i didn't appreciate the amount of bugs flying around me as i was browsing the produce.  \u000a\u000athis will probably be a place i just walk by the next time i'm in the strip.  i did not enjoy it here at all.

Vwhy do people head to klavon's?  walking through the door is like walking through a time portal to a simpler time when people were less rushed and people were more chill.\u000a\u000aklavon's used to be a drugstore and the original owner used to be a pharmacist first with the soda fountain as an aside.  the store was closed for 20 years until the current owners, grandkids of the original klavon decided to reopen it in honor of their dad and grandpa.\u000a\u000aas for their menu, they have all the standards you would expect of an old school ice cream parlor with milk shakes, sundaes, soda floats, as well as just basic ice cream.\u000a\u000abe sure to bring cash, because even though they take debit, there's a service fee to use it.

Vwe just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring pittsburgh.  what a gem!  what a lucky place to stumble in!\u000a\u000aklavon's was a drugstore/soda fountain in the early 1900s.  all the original counters, glass cases filled with old bottles, stools, and mixers are still there.  we had the turtle sundae with amaretto whipped cream, which was amazing.  i can't wait to come back and try their phosphates and egg creams!  it was like stepping into a time machine. you can tell this place is beloved by locals; several elderly couples, families with children, and single people with dogs on leash came by for cones, sundaes, and floats on the beautiful sunny day.  the grandson of the original owners was chatting with customers, and the place had a really special vibe.\u000a\u000ayou almost never see places like this anymore - if you're in pittsburgh, don't miss it!

Vklavon's is a wonderful slice of history.  it's a beautifully preserved old time pharmacy and soda fountain.  ray klavon is the owner and the grandson of the original owner, and this soda fountain is an absolute labor of love.\u000a\u000athere are selections on the menu that you can't find anyplace else...depression era phosphates and also egg cremes.  my favorite ice cream dish is the ballerina...which looks absolutely fabulous and tastes great.\u000a\u000ai love the old phone booth, the marble counters, and the other small details that indicate this place is the genuine article.\u000a\u000ai keep going back again and again, and i am always warmly greeted by the staff.  this is an especially nice place to visit by bike.

Vi hate being the person that brings bad news to a business.  but i would rather yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  more on that later in the review. \u000a\u000ai booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on new year's eve.  check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  i forgot one of my ids in my car and could not be checked in until after i had that id in hand.  after walking back to my car i returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.\u000a\u000athe room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  as several people have already stated, the ceiling were very high.  i was lucky enough to have a front facing room that looked out over penn ave.  i kind of loved this as i could watch the new year's eve parade from my room and save myself from the freezing temps outside.  however, you could tell that this was an older building as the floors creaked as i walked around the room.  i could also hear the person above as they walked about.  the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.  i am not sure how this happened, but i got a handicap room.  so i am assuming that this is why everything felt so spacious in here as well.  everything about the room screamed modern, from the paint colors to the carpeting.  \u000a\u000anow, to get back to what i was referring to at the beginning; the bad news.  upon arriving at the hotel and after checking in i decided i needed to take a nap in preparations for the night's festivities.  it was a fairly short nap, roughly about an hour.  when i woke up after my nap and turned on the light, i noticed something crawling across the sheets.  *starts itching*  yes people, it was what you are thinking, a bedbug.  bedbug!  i immediately grabbed a tissue to dispose of the hideous little monster (i know, it did me no good by doing that, it was more of a reflexive response than anything).  i have made contact with courtyard about this, but have yet to hear back from them on how they are going to rectify the problem.  i felt dirty afterward and moved all of my belongings into the bathroom, on the counter for the remainder of my stay.  i also slept in the other bed (i know, that may have been futile) and with the lights on for the rest of my stay.\u000a\u000aother than that snag, i really have no complaints about this place.  everything and everyone was pleasant.\u000a\u000a*things to note: there is room service available, valet service, or if you prefer, park in one of the city garages and walk to the hotel, business center, fitness center, atm and starbucks available around the clock at the front desk.

Vthe benedum center for the performing arts was originally a movie theater called the stanley. it was built in 1927 and was billed as "pittsburgh's palace of amusement." it's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a "photoplay", but you'd also get live entertainment too. a two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the u.s. department of the interior brought it back to its original condition. \u000a\u000athe grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. in fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. the sightlines here are awesome. it truly is a masterpiece of theater design. \u000a\u000alet's face it fellow yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you? \u000a\u000aokay. \u000a\u000ai came here last night for the decemberists concert featuring justin townes earle as the opener. there were only single seats left when i tried to get tickets. so i ended up going by myself to the show. hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! \u000a\u000athe portland, or based decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their cd "the king is dead" has been doing quite well. so much so that it reached #1 on the billboard charts in late january. the decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called "progressive rock" and british folk but this new cd is definitely more of an americana/alt country sound. so much so that the single "down by the water" reminds me of firetown's "the good life" for some reason (firetown later evolved into garbage--in both senses of the word.. but that's another story). \u000a\u000aso it was no surprise that after doing "the crane wife, parts 1-3", colin meloy told the audience "i don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. we're not a prog band anymore. we're a folk band." hmmm! that actually was a pretty apt description. despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. \u000a\u000athere was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. sam watkins of nickel creek played fiddle against jenny conlee's accordion and they did a rousing irish jig to the song "rox in the box". it was almost strange though how meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song "rise to me". they also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! \u000a\u000abut anyway, this show proved that the decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. i should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the decemberists. now you know where i get those genes from. \u000a\u000aas i mentioned, justin townes earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. his father is the iconic steve earle (another one of my favorites). justin gets his middle name townes, from townes van zandt, of whom steve earle was a great friend. justin townes earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.

Vi was lucky to get a tour of the benedum last month, and i was completely impressed.  this is a painstakingly restored historic building with marvelous architectural and design details.  it is absolutely an beautiful place to go see a musical, the opera, ballet, or a concert.  the staff is amazing and extremely professional, they run this place like clockwork.  i love the natural acoustics of the building, although i don't recommend that you sit under the balcony, that's the worst place to hear a good sound.  don't worry about getting over-dressed for an event at the benedum, this is a truly unique and beautiful landmark that exudes elegance.

Vthis max and erma's has been around ever since i was a little girl.  i think it dates back to when horne's department store occupied the building.  it is a pretty decent place to grab some dinner before going to the theatre, the pirates game, or for a sit-down lunch.  it also makes a nice alternative to the pricier restaurants in the nearby hotels.\u000a\u000athe reviewer below noted that they have a diverse menu so you're not stuck ordering a burger.  this is true, although their burgers are very good.  i'm partial to their salads.  the last time i ate there, i had a very good shrimp salad.  so, yeah, it is a chain place and no better and no worse than any other.  still, you can get a decent meal here and for you beer drinkers, they have a diverse selection.

Vmax & erma's has long been a staple downtown. it's probably the closest thing to chili's or bennigan's down here. i got home late last night from a concert (oddly enough right around the corner at the byham) to fix lunch for today. \u000a\u000ai had a taste for some good french onion soup (hi melanie!) with some melty cheese on it. max & erma's serves theirs in a meal sized bowl, topped with melty swiss & mozzarella cheese! yummy!

Vnormally i wouldn't give a place like max & erma's three reviews.  but my husband rick and i had taken our niece allison and nephew brian to the nearby fort pitt museum and this is the closest restaurant that's family friendly.  allison is now 12 and brian is now 10, so they're no longer ordering off the kids menu.  \u000a\u000aso max & erma's has enough to keep everyone happy.  it's a place that won't break your budget either.

Vi like the 1902 tavern.  it received the first liquor license in western pennsylvania in 1902.  true, there are better choices and i'm essentially a non-drinker.\u000a\u000abut, hey, what do you expect for bar food in downtown?  i had a burger and fries which were as good as any i've had.  the best day to go is on any thursday on "market street thursdays", from june to august. sitting outside, listening to the band while eating.\u000a\u000anot a bad place to be!

Vokay, i admit that i have been a bit of a bad girl with my lunches the past couple of days.  yesterday i ate at fadz sandwich shop and today i went over to wiener world.  i guess i haven't felt like brown-bagging it lately.  \u000a\u000awiener world is another one of those places that has always just been there.  the neon exterior sign proclaims "hot dogs, fries, kielbasa, fish, ice cream, pizza" and believe me, that's all you gotta know about this place.  the dogs are grilled and they do have a certain "crunch" to them.  i like the all-beef dog  with mustard, onions, relish, pickle, and (thanks to my chicago friends) no ketchup!  the chili dogs here are fantastic too.  \u000a\u000athe place is kind of spartan, but it's really more of a "grab-n-go" place.  i took mine back to the office.  they also have a walk-up window and in the summer, many people prefer to dine "al-fresco".  there are numerous squares and plazas nearby in which to have a pleasant lunch.\u000a\u000ai heard a great quote once about work and it went something like this:  "probing the minds of management around here is like probing the innards of a hotdog.  the less you know what's really in there, the happier you are."  but let's face it, sometimes a girl's just gotta have a hotdog and today was one of those days.

Vyum!  i'm sitting here at work and eating my kielbasa & fries as i'm typing this.  i just had to upgrade my review of wiener world from 3 to 4 stars!  see, i call myself a "diabetic foodie".  i have type-1 diabetes, but i do love good food and good comfort food.  don't worry, i still regulate my carbs & insulin to accomodate what i'm eating (mike o. of park ridge, i'm looking at you!).  but i also have one little oddity (okay, one oddity out of many).  after i get over being sick, my appetite kicks into overdrive and i wanna eat.  \u000a\u000aso after being down for the count with a bad cold over easter weekend, and taking yesterday off to recuperate, i came here for lunch today.  i wanted a hotdog ('cos sometimes ya know, a girl's just gotta have one).  but i took one look at the kielbasas and my mind was made  up!

Vwiener world - solid hot dogs , good, not great taste, ok buns, topping are plain.\u000a\u000aww wins the hot dog and bun competition between franktuary but franktuary wins the topping contest hands down. now if we could combine the dogs served here with the toppings at franktuary  you would have  a 4 star hot-dog joint.

Van e-mail conversation with a fellow yelper yesterday reminded me of how much i love stinky food.  so i had to satisfy my craving for such today with a nice kielbasa (or is that kolbassi) from wiener world.  m-m-m-m load that baby up with onions!   dee-lishous!  now will someone please pass me the listerine?\u000a\u000ai also promise i'll hit the treadmill and the elliptical trainer tonight!

Vis a place so mundane as a hotdog stand worthy of four reviews?  well, hell yes!  it seems that yesterday i got a craving for some fine encased meats again.  combine my love of such with my love of dining al fresco and good ol' susan sauntered up to the convenient sidewalk take out window for a fine luncheon experience at the nearby square.  \u000a\u000athe hot sausage specialty sure sounded tempting.  but i'm a chick who likes the basics.  so i got me a pure beef dog, small fries, and diet pop.  i learned the hard way when i was in chicago to never ever put ketchup on a hotdog.  with that lesson in mind, i smeared the red stuff over my fries.  deelishus!

Vwhat's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  read on o' downtown diners!\u000a\u000ait figures.  the other day i was telling my yelp friend mike o. about my sudden lunchtime craving for encased meats.  i figured hey, it being a nice day why not get a dog with all the goodies on it and dine al fresco?  it's mid-october--how many more outdoor dining days are we gonna have?  so i got me a regular dog loaded up with all the goodies, fries, and a drink.  mmmm-mmm good, right?

Vwhat finer lunch is there than hotdogs al fresco on a bee-yoo-tee-full october day?  considering that cold weather might be just around the corner, i figured i didn't have much time left in order to enjoy fine encased meats in one of pittsburgh's many great plazas!   wiener world's dogs have always had a certain snap to 'em and my beef hotdog was just perfect with all the trimmings (no ketchup of course--i learned that from  my chicago friends) and topped off with a small order of fries and a diet pop.\u000a\u000aso, a tasty dog and great weather.  worthy of a 6th review, wouldn't you say?

Voh sammy's...how glad i am to reconnect. i had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  now, that i've moved the office downtown it's convenient for me to visit as much as i'd like.  ray, tom and i found ourselves wondering around the city around lunchtime trying to get a lay of the land and find the good lunch spots when we spotted sammy's... i had almost forgot about this place.  there are a few locations around the city with two downtown (i think?).  the one we went to is close to 6th st. i think.  you walk in and it looks like anyother dumpy yinzer bar with a poke machine to the left next to the cigarette vending.  there is a large bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of regulars having a lunch beer. it's relatively dark inside and for somereason really muggy, not sure why because it's relatively cool outside.  there also is a few larger tables on the right where we decide to sit.  at first we all sat down thinking that there was a server, there wasn't.  so, we looked a little dumb (not the first time), then we realized that you actually order and pay yourself in the back.  in the back there is a deli counter with large coolers to also purchase beer by the 6 pack (i guess).  i order for ray and myself.  i get one corned beef on rye with swiss and a side of dark mustard.  i also get another corned beef with cole slaw as the topping for us. tom gets the corned beef with cole slaw ontop.  i also order a couple orders of macaroni salad and grab a couple of iced teas out of the cooler.  we walk back to the table and i first sample the macaroni salad, not good...not good at all...the flavor is somewhat offputting and there also is something sweet like cinammon in it.  i only have a bite.  now, the sandwiches are great!  i had a 1/2 of the corned beef on rye wiht mustard and it's great!  the bread is fresh, the mustard is cgood quality and the corned beef is delicious piled high packed with flavor.  the other 1/2 i tried with the coleslaw on top is also delicious the coleslaw is creamy and is the perfect topping for the savory corned beef.  i'm glad i re-discovered this place and the next time i'll just get a sandwich to go.

Vsammy's is still the best place in downtown pittsburgh to get a good corned beef sandwich.  it's still a little dive hole-in-the wall place across the street from kaufmann's--ahem--macy's.  still as popular as ever with the lunch crowds, but a great place to go for an inexpensive lunch.

Va few of my co-workers and i decided to try this place yesterday.   it was a sort of early christmas lunch among us because i would be working off-site next week.\u000a\u000athis is a typical bar with an extensive bar-type food menu.  i opted for the soup-and-half-a-sandwich combo.  the french onion soup i had was okay, but a little salty.  my 1/2 a sandwich, the "raechal" (similar to a rueben, but topped with colselaw) with corned beef was decent.

Vnice weather has returned to the 'burgh so i thought i'd get out a little bit for lunch.  hey, it gets a little boring eating lunch at my desk all the time.  \u000a\u000amahoney's is typical bar fare though.  the prices aren't too bad, but it's your typical salad and sandwich menu.   i opted for the 1/2 corned beef with french onion soup.  good way to spend a lunch hour out of the office.

Vawesome, free, installation art gallery. it's open during lunch time during the week also(wed-sat) so it's the perfect alternative to a lunch(or you can go to the street cart right outside of the door!). go into the station and take the small elevator up to the second and third floor. the staff usually won't acknowledge you, but oh well, just walk around and take a peek - the still is always pretty interesting.\u000a\u000athe current exhibit is recent icelandic art called 'long are the days, short are the nights'.  there is also an another piece to this exhibition open at 943 liberty ave on friday and saturday from 11am-8pm or so called paths. it's a pretty cool exhibit, some interesting stuff being done. i liked paths, converge, and rotating unit quite a bit

Vmy husband and i have used amtrak to get from pittsburgh to chicago and we have also used it to get to altoona, lancaster, and harrisburg, pa.  we like using it to get to chicago because the schedule isn't that bad--it leaves late at night an arrives early the next morning.  we always get the sleeper car.  when amtrak is on time, or if it's less than say an hour late, it can be wonderful.  the problem is that amtrak is at the mercy of the freight railroads that own the tracks. \u000a\u000alast year, according to my husband the train enthusiast, the train was constantly arriving into chicago 4 to 5 hours late because of extreme frieght train congestion.  we avoided it then, but since then the company that owns the tracks has gotten its act together and its been much better.  it's also nice that your food travels with you and you can get up and stretch your legs when you want to.\u000a\u000aamtrak used to run two trains a day to chicago and two across pennsylvania.  unfortunately, budget cuts a few years ago caused one of these to be cancelled, so it is much less convenient.  also, the train to washington, dc leaves pittsburgh in the wee hours of the morning.\u000a\u000aone thing i like is that amtrak, upon 24 hours notice, will provide refridgeration or ice for my insulin.  if you are a "special needs" traveller, they can usually accomodate you with advanced notice.  one other tip.  if you are using amtrak, you can actually check your trains' on-time record using the website.  you can see which trains have good on-time records and which don't (and believe my husband when he says it varies from route to route).  you should also always call amtrak's number 1-800-usa-rail before you head out to the train station to check whether or not it will be on time.

Vi went to visit my friend robin w. in dc over memorial day weekend.  i could have driven, but my husband rick needed the car.  airfares between the 'burgh and dc were just too expensive.  greyhound?  no way!  being that i have a railfan for a husband, i've taken amtrak many times.  i've also used the train to harrisburg when i've had business there.  \u000a\u000aso there i was, waiting for the 5:30am departure.  susan is not a morning person and she doesn't assume human female form until she's had that second cup of coffee.  i joked with a couple of other yelpers that maybe i should board in my pjs, blanket in one hand, teddy bear in the other.  yeah, i'm sure the passengers and crew would have loved that sight!  i went back to sleep once that train hit mckeesport.  \u000a\u000abut east of pittsburgh, the train goes thru some terrific scenery.  it goes through mountains, tunnels, and river valleys.  in meyersdale the train passes mount davis, the highest point in pennsylvania.  the scenic high point is sand patch, which according to my route guide, "sand patch marks the summit of the alleghenies and the eastern continental divide. rain falling on the west end of the tunnel flows to the gulf of mexico and rain falling at the east end of the tunnel flows to the atlantic ocean."  the train also passes the cumberland gap and harper's ferry.\u000a\u000aone thing i was grateful for:  the full diner car on the train.  a breakfast of real french toast and coffee, coffee, and more coffee hit the spot.  just so you know, the diner has "community seating", so if you're traveling alone, you're gonna be seated with 2-3 other travelers.

Vwhen times are tough and you really don't want to be spending $50 on a tank of gas.  this is one of your better options.  i've taken the train several times and i have to say it was a nice experience.  for half of what i would have paid to fill my tank up with gas i was able to get a round trip ticket to the johnstown station and back.  the regular seats are good enough for me.  it's comfortable, even if you do have to sit next to a complete stranger.

Vthis review is for amtrak's "pennsylvanian" train, only, not for the system as a whole.\u000a\u000ao' amtrak's "pennsylvanian" train.  so much potential!\u000a\u000athe good:\u000a\u000a--spectacular scenery between greensburg and harrisburg.  the highpoint is the stretch between johnstown and altoona, especially horseshoe curve.\u000a\u000a--relaxing ride and not putting up with traffic.\u000a\u000a--generally friendly crews.\u000a\u000athe bad:\u000a\u000a--lousy westbound schedule that puts you into pittsburgh at 8pm--well past dinnertime.   if you need sustenance, you have to eat the 'meh" food from the lounge car--or bring your own.  if you're connecting to the westbound "capitol" train, you're stuck with a four hour layover in amtrak's basement waiting room. \u000a\u000a--if you're heading eastbound, the "pennsylvanian" receives connecting passengers from the "capitol".  guess what?  if that train's late, you're leaving late.\u000a\u000aoddly enough, the schedule worked in our favor this time.  supervisor susan and three of her team members had to take a one-day business trip to altoona.  our company car was already spoken for, however the train schedule allowed a full business day.  the only question was, would the train depart on time?  hooray!  it did!  believe me, we did not have a lot of time to make it to the jobsite in altoona.

Vnot four-star cuisine, but good take out.   as you can tell i am a regular lunch goer on penn avenue. the take out food at fu lai is always dependable and the price is reasonable.  because i prefer my food to be a little on the plain side, i always get the chicken with pea pods or the chicken with vegetables.  very satisfying!

Vit'd been a few years since i've been to fu lai and judging by the more recent reviews, it's become hit or miss.  but i was on penn avenue last month and i thought i'd stop in for lunch (and yeah, i'm procrastinating on my reviews here).\u000a\u000ai guess i was there on a "hit" day 'cos my lunch was pretty decent.  i usually get chicken with vegetables or chicken with peapods at places like this.  so i guess you've gotta stick to the basics when eating here.

Va co-worker and i decided to go out to lunch together today.  as a contrast to the rather bland, rushed meal i ate yesterday at subway, i suggested he and i try this place.  i'd read good things about it in the "post-gazette" and the "tribune-review".\u000a\u000athe rachel sandwich sounded mighty tempting, but since i was in the mood to sample, i tried the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo.  the soup was delicious and it sure didn't taste canned.  the 1/2 chicken sandwich on rye was very fresh too.  good, inexpensive place to eat at.  they do catering too, so maybe i'll recommend them for the next office party.

Va decent enough dry cleaners, and virtually the only one in downtown with 30 minute service.  i brought some pants here right before i went on my business trip.  so that quick service really came in handy.\u000a\u000aone thing though, i wish they'd update their website.  none of the icons (corporate info, services, products) work.  anyone trying to use their website before coming in might assume they're out of business.

Vbest deli in the city.  it's not a tasting shop, but if you go during off-peak hours and ask to try a bunch of things, they're more than willing to make your day brighter.  great selection of random italian dry goods.  worth a trip, although avoid weekend afternoons if you're adverse to crowds.

Vi walked into penn macaroni co knowing i knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses.  i've always been intimidated by specialty shops b/c there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out.  i decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when i walked in.\u000a\u000ai headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats.  when one of the deli guys was free and asked me if i needed help, i flat out told him "i know nothing about anything in this room.  but i want to learn."  and he was like "i got just what you need" and brought out some samples for me.  he went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff.  after i picked out my meat, i was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like "i'm not done with you yet!" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out.  he also told me i have to feed my friend more b/c she looked too skinny, =p.\u000a\u000ai love going into a store where i get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job.  it just makes you walk out with a smile on your face.\u000a\u000ai plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated, haha

Vcould i do all my shopping at penn mac?  no way.\u000a\u000ahowever, it will always be at least a bi-weekly stop for me because of their amazing selection of italian imports and fresh cheese.  things i'll always buy here:  canned san marzano tomatoes for homemade sauce, fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, and these awesome little italian candies called pocket coffee.  \u000a\u000aif you're in pittsburgh and ever cook italian food, i recommend a stop!

Vpennsylvania macaroni company, you are one of many pittsburgh landmarks that i always knew was there, so i never bothered to investigate. one day i made the trek in to inspect the wares because someone on a talk thread had tipped me off that penn mac co might have the hot sauce selection i so desperately craved.\u000a\u000aupon entering you're greeted with all sorts of goodies. bulk dry foods, cheese, barrels of bulk olives(mmm), meats, boxed items, olive oils, etc. the smells are strong and all of the tastes are equally, if not more so. \u000a\u000aafter inspecting the cheese(and contemplating the benefits of a cheese of the month club), i rounded the bend and lo and behold, a beautiful selection of hot sauces! all different kinds, i inspected them all until i came across... iguana golden habanero! this sauce is my favorite, a total all-star, and i just got a bottle of it imported for my birthday! as you can imagine, that was a costly endeavor, but here at penn mac, it is a mere $4! incredible. there are a ton of other novelty sauces and whatnot if you're a fan, i recommend taking a look. \u000a\u000aas you exit to the back, there is some produce and a few lanes of registers. it was late on a saturday(they were about to close) and there was no line. the place is a treasure and it's definitely worth stopping in, chances are you'll find a few items you didn't know you needed, or didn't think you could pick up in the burgh

Vthe penn mac is a landmark in pittsburgh.  i am a comlplete fan, in particular of their cheese section, which in many ways is the world's best.  they beat out the competition because of their excellent prices, selection, and their quality.  i have checked the prices at whole foods and market district, and often times you pay twice as much at those places for the same cheese.  carol, a.k.a. dearheart, is a wonderful help, especially if you are there on a day when it's not as over crowded.  some other great things about the store...bulk spices (very reasonably priced), olive oil, dried fruit, deli meats, and more.  this store is my favorite place in pittsburgh and you are missing out if you have not visited!

Vpennmac, you are not good for my waist line, but i cannot stay away.  i believe it could be the aroma that draws you in. much like the cartoons of my childhood where the aroma has hands, grasps you, entrances you and pulls you willingly into the store. \u000a\u000awhere to start is always a hard question to answer here. should i go wait at the cheese counter?  should i debate what type of nuts i want?  browse the freshly baked bread?  mull over the many, many types of tomato pastes/sauces?  ah, screw it, go crazy, fun house crazy, and run around looking for your prizes.\u000a\u000athe bread is delicious, and huge.  i made so many things with the loaf i bought and almost ran out of ideas. i cannot even remember what else i bought here because i was enamored by that bread.

Vlocated in downtown pittsburgh, the harris is part of pgh filmmakers who also own the regent square and the melwood screening room.  like its filmmakers' brethren, it shows a lot of art, foreign, & indie films that you can't see anywhere else.  oddly enough, it was once known as the arts cinema when it was a porno house.  \u000a\u000ai mainly go to the regent square for my artier fare, as well as the manor (when they get a good indie).  i've got a screenie pass to any pgh filmmaker cinema, which is good for 12 admissions and 12 popcorns and beverages.  i came here to see "the interrupters", a documentary by the same folks that did "hoop dreams".  "the interrupters" was filmed in chicago takes an intimate look at the stubborn, persistence of urban gang violence. the "interrupters" are a group of ex-convicts who've joined ceasefire, an innovative organization determined to stop by getting  out on the streets and  resolving conflict. \u000a\u000abelieve me folks, this movie is an eye-opener and extremely worth seeing.  much better than anything michael moore could have done.\u000a\u000ai wish i could give it five stars, but there are a few key issues with this place.  first of all, it seems a little lacking in amenities.  second of all, its acoustics aren't all that great.  third of all, its marquee isn't the greatest.  as far as i'm concerned, it still looks like a holdover from its porno days.  but they show great films here and since the fulton mini/byham is now a concert hall, downtown pittsburgh needs a venue like this.

Vthe harris is a great place to go for independent/art/foreign films. the screen is a little small, so if that's a concern, the regent should be your first choice.  i can usually find an available parking spot on the street.  the staff is helpful and artsy/hip.  there's a cool gallery space downstairs.  the selection of films shown is really worth taking a look at.  yes, the theater itself could use a bit sprucing up, but it's still an enjoyable place to see an indie film.

Vi like little indie theaters like this.  (warning: if you want big comfy seats, digital projection, surround sound, and a bucket o' soda, head elsewhere!)  it's small, shows art/foreign/indie films, and you can get a ginger ale for $1.50.  my ticket was only $4 since i'm a grad student...you can't beat that, and there are some amazing movies that show here!  my husband complained the whole time that the seats were uncomfortable, but i was fine.\u000a\u000ai am glad that we have the harris downtown, and i will most likely return.

Vthis coffeeshop is a winner.\u000a\u000athey have deli foods, which always have a happy line, but i've never managed to try them.  i made a beeline for the back of the shop, where they probably have fifty varieties of coffee beans, and at least as many varieties of tea.  behind the coffee, in a glass-walled room, is the roaster, this enormous machine that lets them roast the beans fresh, all the time, in the store.\u000a\u000abehind the counter is an older guy named john prestogeorge.  when i asked him for a recommendation, he suggested the j.p. hearty blend on their coffee list, which is a blend he started selling in the 1960's.  he's still there.  it's still good.  lately, i've moved to the organic sumatran, and really want to try the kona; i'm confident they'll be around for awhile, and i'll be headed back.

Vprestogeorge is not entirely at fault for my coffee addiction, but it is what got me off starbucks/keurig cups and into the jittery world of grind-your-own-coffee enthusiasm.  they have so many different blends and flavors, all roasted on site.  a few of my favorites:\u000a\u000aitalian roast (espresso--the old standby), 100% kona (delicious, but $$$$, so an occasional treat), vermont maple, coconut cream\u000a\u000athey also have a full deli, specialty foods, and as many kinds of loose tea as they have coffee blends.  every time i'm at prestogeorge stocking up on beans, i think about starting a loose tea collection...but that would surely lead to over-caffeination.

Vthis restaurant has remained - longer than i expected, frankly.  but the food is ok, definitely not great and is fairly forgettable.  the wine list is also forgettable.  overall, this is a place that i go to if i have to for an event, but probably wouldn't think about otherwise.  it is well-located in the strip district though and near some bars, so if you want to be able to walk from place to place, this is a place to consider if italian is what you are in the mood for.  fairly pricey for what they offer.

Vi really enjoyed my experience at lidia's.  my friend and i were seated promptly, and we shared an order of the crab fricos, which were quite good.  for my main course, i had a calamari dish with large beans.  i can't remember the name of it, and it's not on the menu online, so ... but all i can say is that my mouth started salivating as i was writing this, so you know it was good.\u000a\u000afor dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, which was incredibly rich.  i don't think we finished it, but it was good.\u000a\u000aall in all, a very pleasant experience.  would love to go again.

Vjeez...has it really been a month since i've been here as i look at the receipt.  well, i'll try to fill in the blanks.  this may be one of my new fav' brunch spots.  i'm not a fan of brunches as i detest most buffet style dining (has to do with my germophobia), sneeze guards...etc. howeve, this is the type of brunch i can deal with.  first let's start with the space.  it's a beautiful restaurant that's been here for a few years.  lidia of pbs fame has only three restaurants i believe (one in nyc, one in kc, and for some reason one in pgh).  as an aside i was told when i asked that one of the reasons lidia chose pittsburgh is because the ratings for her cooking show are better in this small metro than any other urban setting.  i dont' remembe all the details of the space except there were very high ceilings and ornate chandeliers (sp?).  we sat at the long bar and had a great professional bartender.  the bar offers a birds eye view into the open kitchen with many "back of the house" folks running about in organized confusion.  it's a bit busier today than usual isuspect because the matriarch herself "lidia" is here barking orders and checking plates.  i'm told she only visits a few times a year and is here for the tomatoe dinner...btw, lidia in person looks very much like her profile on tv,,, she seems warm, genuine and very...how should i say..."grandmotherlike".  she comes out of the kitchen signs afew autographs and then has a seat by herself sipping an espresso watching the show go past...okay, onto the food one of the main reason's i like this brunch is because the brunch entree's are cooked to order and offer some interesting options outside of your typical brunch fair.  it's relatively reasonable at $22 for everything including a "well" bloody mary.  the brunch starts with a delicious assortment of warm bread from the in house bakery served with three flavored butters.  i believe they are one with "crunchy" sugar, apricot and strawberry.  i like the crunchy one the best and quite frankly could have made a meal out of the bread and butter alone.  the buffet portion (if you will) has some fun options such as a great antipasta platter, all cheese and meats served at the perfect temperature with some house made pickles.  also, there is a nice frittata (think italian omelette) along with a couple assorted salads and fruit.  you then have your choice of about a dozen main courses...everything from there famous pasta tasting trio for those who really want to "carb up" to beef tenderloin and chicken.  annie orders this delicious duck pasta.  i don't think it's on the traditional brunch menu but it is soft pillows of al dente' pasta stuffed with a savory mix of duck and spices served in a small bowl with a dusting of cheese.  it was quite good.  i order the chicken livers, which are flavorful quick seared chicken livers, about medium rare served with polenta and fried onions.  i'm not a big polenta fan and the dish could have used some sauce, but overall it was a nice flavorful brunch.  you also get to peruse the dessert menu for the $22, but we skipped it.  we found the food quite good and the service outstanding.  now, granted the boss was there so it was everyones "a game"...i don't care even without the best efforts i'm guessing this will become a somewhat regular stop for us.

Vi grew up watching lidia's tv show as a kid.  so of course when i found out she had a restaurant in pittsburgh i just had to try it out.\u000a\u000athe biggest selling point of lidia's is probably their service.  people say ti's a good "date spot" mainly b/c of the atmosphere and service.  their wait staff definitely has been trained to the attentive, but at times it can be overly done and i feel like i'm a part of a weeknight sitcom.\u000a\u000afor appetizers, get their grilled octopus.  i've heard good things about their chicken livers, but i've never tried it myself.  their fritto misto is prepared well, but not excessively special.\u000a\u000atheir pasta tasting trio is always a great way if it's your first time at lidia's; they always have two house-made pastas and one imported from italy.  from my experience, i've always enjoyed their housemade varieties, especially their pappardelle and gnocci (when available).  their ravioli's are typically pretty good too.  the imported pastas just don't seem to reach that perfect al dente "bite" fresh pastas can achieve.\u000a\u000atheir ossobuco is a giant braised lamb shank that is fork tender and flavorful in a dark rich sauce.  it seems to be a popular dish, as the last time i was at lidia's they were out of it.\u000a\u000aon an ending note: lidia's does take reservations (just visit their website or hop onto opentable and rack up those dining points), but i've never had an issue getting a seat without reservations.

Vlet's see....an italian restaurant in pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own italian cooking show? should be great, right? not so much.\u000a\u000awent here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at lidias. perhaps i went on the wrong day, but i thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. at the very least, there are italian restaurants in pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.\u000a\u000athe one positive to lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. i had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. the coffee with grappa was also quite nice.\u000a\u000aall things told, though, i would spend my money elsewhere.

Vmy coworker had been recommending lidia's to me for a while, and i'm glad i listened to her and brought my family here for dinner last week.  we had a wonderful italian meal, and one of the better dining experiences in pittsburgh so far.\u000a\u000awe had a reservation on saturday night around 6 pm, and used their valet service ($5?  $6?  i forget).  we were seated right away, and we all admired the gorgeous dining room space.  it seems to have been built in an old warehouse - the ceiling is massively high, and there's gorgeous mondrian-esque glass over the bar.  very stylish!  \u000a\u000ai should also say right off the bat that our server was outstanding.  friendly, funny, and knowledgeable, he was one of the best parts of the whole experience.  he helped us choose a wine which we all enjoyed, and he poured it skillfully.  he was also helpful to us at various points throughout the meal - for example, four of us began with the insalata di rucola (split two salads between four people, and they came on separate plates).  the salad sounded amazing, with arugula, pear, walnuts, and gorgonzola (get in mah belleh) but we all noticed that there was quite a lack of...well, pear.  we all had maybe one measly little wedge, and it definitely kept the salad from being as yummy as it should have been.  so we told our server about it, and he immediately brought out a plate full of pear slices.  redeemed!  and the salad became delicious.\u000a\u000amy entree was the ravioli di cinghale (ravioli filled with wild boar, in a rosemary sauce) and it was pretty delicious.  three big raviolis, filled with succulent meat (think pulled pork, but italian and well-spiced).  the sauce was very very light, but still flavorful.  my dad got the pasta trio, and it was hilariously awesome to watch three different guys come by with big bowls, delivering their delicious wares to his plate.  he had a lot of fun with that.  my mom loved her sea bass as well.  \u000a\u000adad's pasta trio came with a dessert, so he got the crostata di pere, a sugary pear maple dessert which i think was good, but i don't have really strong memories of it so clearly it didn't bowl me over.\u000a\u000aall in all, it was a very good meal with some truly excellent service.  we felt cared for and comfortable, and our bellies were full.  what more could we ask for?

Voh lidia's!  how you've forsaken me!  \u000a\u000ai came here with a group of friends after having talked up the calamari entree.  three out of five of us got it (the others had the osso buco and a pasta dish - the osso buco was good, and the pasta dish was a "meh") and i just wanted to put my face behind my hands and whimper out of embarrassment.  the dish was totally watered down and not flavorful at all.  i did ask for it to be made a little less spicy, and i think their solution to that was to dilute the sauce.  but, another one of us had the entree at full strength, and it wasn't much better!\u000a\u000ai was questioned as to whether i would come back again, and i suppose i would answer yes to that, but only if someone else wanted to go.  after this experience, i don't think i can face the disappointment another time.

V3.5 stars.  i was brought in by the claims of how large the "roethlisburger" is by vendors and other shoppers in the strip district and i had to see it in person.  \u000a\u000apeppi's has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  the flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of peppi's has a couple tables and booths with steelers paraphernalia on the walls.\u000a\u000ai wasn't too hungry so i ended up ordering "the phantom", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  my companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the "roethlisburger" itself.  all the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.\u000a\u000athe phantom was a little smaller than i expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  my only complaint is that i would have liked a little more meat.  after some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.\u000a\u000afor some reason based on the picture of the roethlisburger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  i guess camera angles can be deceiving.  it's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with american cheese and a fried egg.\u000a\u000aoverall i would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.\u000a\u000aanyways, i'm definitely going to be back to try the roethlisburger since now i view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge.

Vgreat place for a party!  i had a party here last night and the banquet facilities are top notch.  we had several hors d'oevres the lamb lollipops were awesome and a must have when you have an event here.  the lobster rolls were not memorable and i'd suggest you skip these when choosing your items.  the crabmeat stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  i was very impressed with our entrees we had a filet and crabcake dinner.  i'm always a little scared with mass produced filets, but they were all cooked perfectly.  the crabcakes had almost no filler and were jumbo lump crabmeat.  dante is the banquet manager and very accomodating.  i definitely suggest you select the symphony a and b room for your event.  that's on the second floor with a great view of the north shore and pnc park.  they are not flexible on the food and beverage minimums, but if your party is big enough (i had about 50) they will throw in a complimentary room and may even waive the fee for the coat check girl.   drinks are reasonable priced and if you request certain types of liquor they will provide them for you.  the hotel itself is beautiful.  the rooms have very comfortable beds and are spacious.  make sure you request a room with a river view.  i also suggest not valeting.  it's $25 which is way too much for pittsburgh.

Vthe reason for this update is the service.  the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  all solid four stars.  i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  in the past i was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  i get there and am running a bit late. i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  i tell him i'm in a rush.  he runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  while i'm waiting my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  the party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  one of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  he ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  btw, did i mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  the next morning i get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  everything about this place is three to four stars.  my main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  there lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  you can't go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot.

Vthis is a very good hotel and with a corporate rate of $107 per night it is the best bargain in town.  i stay in hotels in the city often rather than drive home after a night  of partying and i used to stay at the holiday inn express s. side for the location.  the holiday inn cost is $140 per night and the hotel is fine for a place to crash for a few hours, but  the westin is actually a place that i look forward to visiting.  the rooms are pretty big.  request the higher floors because the view is awesome.  i stayed on the 25th floor last night and had a great view of the arena and train station.  the beds are great.  they also have a fridge for you  to put your own drinks.  however, i think they  should have a minibar.  mario the doorman also is pretty helpful.

Vi gotta admit, the fish sandwich here is awesome!  it's deep fried so that the fat will seep into the meat of the fish!  it's totally bad for you, but the quality of the fish itself is usually good.  it is nice and tender.  you can put your own tartar sauce on it to make it as unhealthy as you want, but it's good with just some lemon on it--the way i like it!\u000a\u000ai can only eat about 1/2 the sandwich, so i usually end up cutting it in half and sharing it.

Vok, here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. where i'm from, you can't call your restaurant an "oyster house" without raw oysters served, unless you want a good ass whoopin'. \u000a\u000anothing else about this place remotely conveys "oyster house." it's a fried seafood joint, that doesn't serve yuengling nor takes credit cards. we got all of our food on styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. the "waitress" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. this particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  it was unsettling. you also have to pay before being served. \u000a\u000athe new england clam chowder was good.

Vlet's face it folks--this ain't mccormick & schmick.  it's a dive, it's cheap, and the fish here is oh so good, providing you lower your expectations a little.  meaning that you're not gonna get five-star cuisine but you'll get good basic chow here.  i went for the baked scrod sandwich and a side of hot sausage soup.  trust me, if you're a soup lover like me, you'll want to come here whenever that's the soup of the day.\u000a\u000aguess i'll be hitting the gym tonight after work.

Vworth the visit, if only for a slice of pittsburgh history.  the buttermilk and oyster is a tradition.  i got the fish boat, and i enjoyed it very much.  the food is mostly made from scratch and the french fries are delicious.\u000a\u000ait's not fine dining, but it's honest food at a reasonable price.  the restaurant dates from 1870, so it makes it the oldest business in the city.

Vone word to describe it, meh.\u000a\u000ai've only managed to stomach this place a handful of times.  i'm not sure if it's the placement of the bar right inside the door that causes me to dislike it.  or the congestion caused by the location of the bar right inside the door.  further back you go the more spacious it gets, but it never seems to be utilized correctly.  \u000a\u000aevery time i am there there seems to be something going on which entails that there will always be a cover charge which ranges from $1 for amateur stripper night to $5 for a drag show upstairs.  that's another thing i cannot comprehend about this place, you have two floors of space but if an event is not taking place you only use one floor causing people to be crammed around the bar by the main entrance (yes, i'm still complaining about that). \u000a\u000akaraoke night here isn't as bad as other local establishments, people can actually sing.  drinks are reasonable priced.  bartenders are attentive.  that is if you can make to the bar for a drink.  \u000a\u000aone bad drawback about this place is that every once in a while you have a random person roaming around asking if you want to buy drugs off them.  crack is whack.

Vi have conflicted feelings about harp & fiddle.  i love the space, the drinks, and the live music.  i do not, however, like the cover charge that happens for every single event. great guinness toast (where you had to use plastic cups!)- $5; st. patrick's day parade- $10!! we made it for breakfast on parade day, had a fine breakfast there (eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, potatoes for 8 bucks), then left for the parade.  we returned around noon, and they wanted 10 clams a piece to come back in and drink $6 guinness out of a plastic cup.  i just couldn't do it, and neither could the rest of my party.  i also don't appreciate that the cover charges are never mentioned in their e-mail newsletter. i know a man's gotta make that money, but sheesh!

Vwe made the foolish mistake of trying to spend our groupon at penn brewery on a saturday, without a reservation.  daunted by the wait, and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food, my boyfriend i were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered - isn't there a little irish bar just off the main drag of the strip district?  let's go investigate.\u000a\u000aso investigate we did, i'd say around 730 on a saturday night.  it was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside - a few tables here and there, but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks, or eat dinner.  there was lots of irish paraphernalia on the walls, but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting.  a little dimness could've gone a long way!  we got some beer on draft - a harp for me - and started with the fried pickles, which were served with honey mustard.  they were.....fried pickles.  they were served as whole spears, not bite-size pieces, so sometimes the breading would slide off, but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard.  good size appetizer portion.\u000a\u000aboth craving something authentic, my boyfriend got the fish 'n' chips, and i got the corned beef and cabbage.  both were utterly no frills.  my boyfriend lauded their authenticity, and i have to confess, the fish 'n' chips were spot on.  especially the fish.  that taste!  it took me back to my semester studying abroad in england, eating fish 'n' chips out of a paper cone.  it didn't need anything fancy or unique to dress it up - it was great as it was.  he was hugely satisfied.\u000a\u000ai was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage.  while i won't question the authenticity, the overall effect was that the food was plain.  well-cooked, and in a good portion, but not really crave-worthy.  there were some vegetables on the side as well, everything prepared with utter simplicity.  i enjoyed the taste, but after a few bites, i wanted something more.  it was a large portion, so i took some home, but we weren't even motivated to reheat it.  it didn't really do it for me.   apologies to ireland if that's how this dish was meant to be prepared - if that's the case, i suppose it just wasn't my thing.\u000a\u000awe started to leave just as a few musicians came in.  i think i'd enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live irish music!  service was a bit slow, but if i was there to relax and unwind for a few hours, i wouldn't mind at all.

Vthis is the best irish pub in the city; while claddagh is a corporate chain (that isn't quite authentic), and piper's pub is a wonderful pub... of the british isles, mullaney's is irish, and a great place to grab some food and drink.\u000a\u000atons of travelling entertainers and bands, fantastic eats, and friendly, good staff.

Vthis is the most authentic irish pub you will find.   the food is good and plentiful and the beer selection is impressive.  i have been several times to the ceili  dances on tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. there's lots of live music, and a truly irish ambiance.

Vmy ngoc had an apparent makeover and is currently under new management.  the claim to their reputation though was lucy sheets who used to sell banh mi outside their store.  banh mi is a vietnamese sandwich that is a french baguette with a sort of meat filling, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, jalapenos, and mayo.  traditionally they also have pate, but the ones at my ngoc don't have it.\u000a\u000aunfortunately, the new owner informed me that lucy has moved and set up shop in nyc.  however, they still do sell tasty roast pork or chicken banh mi.\u000a\u000aa warm french baguette is filled with the meat of choice and topped with the tasty ingredients.  the heat of the jalapenos are cooled by the pickled vegetables and the mayo helps bring all the ingredients together.  by pittsburgh standards, it's worthy of 4 stars easy.  \u000a\u000aon the other hand, their pho has much room for improvement.  the broth wasn't as savory and flavorful as i've had elsewhere and the noodles were a bit on the tougher side.\u000a\u000aa banh mi will run you $5-$6, which is definitely on the pricier side given it's size, but as a niche food in a small market, i'm definitely not complaining if i need my banh mi fix.  for pho though, i'd head elsewhere for now.

Vi am a huge fan of shopping off-price places like filene's, tj maxx, marshall's, and burlington coat factory.  yeah there's a lot of crap.  yeah, there's a lot of stuff that has been picked over.  but every so often, i find that one item i've been looking for.  i recently bought a nice polo knit shirt for my husband and no one can tell that i didn't buy it at macy's.\u000a\u000ai like this location because it's downtown and i can shop on my lunch hour.

Vstopped here on my lunch today to do a little shopping.  found a cute little sundress for 60% off retail price.  found a shirt my husband rick had been looking for too.  so yeah, coming here is always a gamble and you've gotta sift through a lot.  but occasionally you can find something.

Vi used to really like this place, but the service can't be overlooked anymore.  i ate here recently on a monday afternoon (granted it's not the a team on monday's), but  it was so obvious the staff just wanted to get us out of there so they could go back to reading star magazine.  the food was good, not great but good enough.  the service as mentioned was poor.  the server was apathetic at best.  he didn't give us time to finish our soup before he had our entree's in front of us and a check on the table.  i think this was my last visit.

Vjust had the panang tofu for lunch, and was crazy underwhelmed.  tiny portion, very watery sauce, and just no *zing* at all to the flavor.  the wait staff was slammed by a half-full restaurant, so things like a coke took ten or fifteen minutes.\u000a\u000athis trip was bad, even for the price.

Vthis starbucks is worthy of mention only because it moved into the lobby of the former plaza theater.  the plaza is where my friends and i (legally) first saw r-rated movies on our own.  i remember seeing "pulp fiction" here.\u000a\u000aotherwise, it's just a starbucks.

Vthe artworks essentially a very long hallway with a stage and a pa at one end. it is a low(200) capacity venue catering to the off-center art crowd, and if you identify with that then you have probably already been called here by one of the many shows that it hosts. shows here can range from 'the-biggest-name-you've-never-heard-of" to simply "the-name-you've-never-heard-of". the art is usually local, and can obviously be hit or miss. the sound and conditions could be better, depending on what show you're seeing. in the summer the place can get unbearably hot, with people running for the exits between sets.\u000a\u000aparking on the street is plentiful and free, and while there usually isn't too much within walking distance on a sparsely crowded night, liberty avenue is only a few blocks away to grab a bite to eat beforehand. the trip downstairs to the bathroom is somewhat disturbing. the toilet, appropriately, also lies at the end of a long hallway, behind a door which may or may not be able to close completely. cleanliness of this one was an afterthought. \u000a\u000ahowever, while you hesitantly make your way towards the bathroom, be sure to check out the posters lining the wall of the stairs. some of the past line-ups may astound you(and the prices you could have seen them for). make no mistake, there is a fairly solid quality to the music here(especially from touring bands) and over the years many of them go on to be influential in one way or another. so if it's your thing, but sure to stop out and catch a show - the music will probably be solid, and the tickets are cheap!\u000a\u000athey're the only place on the street that requests donations for entry during unblurred, but honestly i can't imagine the place is a gold mine regularly and the music they host is important to pittsburgh(in my opinion), so i never mind tossing in a few bucks. also, imo, promotion isn't the best here, so check the website to find out the latest shows, or stop in during unblurred.

Vthis store is small, so the merch is limited, but the volunteer staff does a pretty good job of keeping it stocked. there is always new stuff there. the real draw of this place is that it is cheap. i mean, it beats the pants off the prices at any other thrift store in town. there's furniture too. additionally, it supports the fine and commendable work of the thomas merton center, so you can get worthwhile junk for superlow prices and support an organization you should be supporting already. wow!

Vthis was my first visit to paddy cake.  i had to pick up a little something for this diabetes support group i belong two.  yes, i am aware of the irony folks.  just remember this, diabetics can have cakes and sweets in moderation!  and my little group has evolved into an excuse to get together and play cards or board games!  anyway, i picked up a small coffee cake for the occasion.\u000a\u000athis place is a treat just to walk into.  it's got everything a traditional bakery should have and is very inviting.  i read a few bad reviews on google about their customer service.  i don't see why--their service seemed fine to me.  i haven't actually tasted the cake yet, so i can't comment on it.

Vangelo's pizzeria was recently featured as a finalist for best hoagie in town and the only one on the list nearby. they also had a vegetarian hoagie on the menu, so in the haste of a hunger-driven decision i called and ordered a veggie hoagie($7.75 - hold the mushrooms), mayo, and an order of fries($4).\u000a\u000awe arrived at the shop about 10 minutes later and waited another 5 watching jeopardy while our food finished up. the store was clean, the dough was being rolled out by hand, and there were people eating inside. the pizza was square-sliced and looked good, but we didn't have any.\u000a\u000awhen we got home with the food, we started into the fries. they give you a lot - you get a small pizza box filled with them - an extra buck or so nets you cheese melted all over it. the fries were very tasty, and had a remnant taste of chicken wing to them. they were also very salty, which i prefer.\u000a\u000athe hoagie was a different beast entirely. a few dots of grease on the outside of the paper could not prepare me for the damp towel of sandwich paper i would see when i opened it up.  the hoagie consisted mainly of grilled peppers and onions as advertised, but having asked for extra mayo(as sarah s suggested) may have been a bit much in this case. they really gave me what i asked for, this thing may as well have been a mayo sandwich with lettuce and onions.\u000a\u000athe taste was awesome and even with all of the grease the bread stayed crispy, but not crunchy as many roof-of-your-mouth-scraping sandwiches around town are.my real qualm is about the texture though, and i'm sure it applies most to the veggie hoagie, with no cheese or meat to provide resistance, it all just sinks and squishes around. they need something firm, something that provides some resistance - take big jim's, where roasted broccoli and carrots give a nice firm crunch to make you feel like you're eating solid food.\u000a\u000aso while i give the taste an easy four stars, i have to deduct a point for the texture of the sandwich, hoping that maybe they will try to add a firmer vegetable to it to make eating it not feel quite as much like sausage gravy on a roll. however i'm sure if you go for a meat-laden variety it will be totally worth your time.

Vif you're not racing your bicycle, this is the shop to go to.  $75-150 gets you out the door with a bike, if you're willing to do some of the tinkering yourself, in the shop.  really a one-of-a-kind place, and a place i'm really, really glad exists.  go visit.

Vi have never heard of pizza italia last week, let alone eaten a thing from them.  shame, shame on me for not doing so earlier.  \u000a\u000ai trusted my friend when i was informed that not only was the pizza good, but i'd be wanting more.  there was no lie in that statement whatsoever.  we got a medium and large pizza with pepperoni.  unlike typical places where you get the big slices of pepperoni thrown on top without a care, here you get the smaller, more true pepperoni that is strategically placed to maximize your chance of getting pepperoni in every bite.  what's also good about this pepperoni is that it curls up perfectly to create that awesome little bowl for grease to collect.  you know, that grease that you have to just dip your crust in.\u000a\u000ayes, i did rip my crust off before i got to it just so i could enjoy my fattening myself.  no judging allowed!\u000a\u000ahowever, i cannot give you five stars pi (i like that, pi, pizza pi, such a connection).  you do not deliver.

Vno way, dudes. go down the street and get some tastier food at tram's kitchen. the grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better. \u000a\u000areally. i'm not joking about the water.

Vi absolutely love noodle soups.  from cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).\u000a\u000apho minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in pittsburgh.  their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (cough tram's kitchen cough).  also, they do some of the "unique" parts such as tripe, which i am a fan of.\u000a\u000aservice is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  yes, if i want some fresh spring rolls (gi cun), i'll probably head to tram's, but when i want pho, i want no nonsense pho, and pho minh is the place to be.\u000a\u000aon a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me i'm heading to pho minh for their pho.

Vthis is a vet for cats, not a vet for people. this staff is going to do what is best for your cat, make recommendations for the benefit of your cat, and that may not always be the most convenient thing for you, as a human person. however, if you love your cat(s), this is the place to be. \u000a\u000aone of my cats is extremely nervous in public situations, but always calms around the dr. here. the doctor seems to talk to the cat in some secret mystical cat language. there is a real sense of cat community, from the portraits of the clinic's cats, to the bulletin board with cat-related notices, to the high-quality toys and treats for sale. \u000a\u000aanother of our cats went to the great litterbox in the sky at this office. this is a horrible, difficult, awful thing to live through. i miss him terribly every day, even though it has been years. i am very grateful that the cat clinic & their wonderful staff was there for us. i am not sure that any other vet would have held me and said comforting things while i sobbed, taken phone calls from my friend, and provided such solid e for effort. \u000a\u000ai have always felt like we have received the best possible service here. even though they are a bit more expensive than "budget" vets around town, the experience here has always been worth every penny. the peace of mind that comes from knowing you are doing the best by your pet is priceless to me. cats don't have voices and cats can't make their own decisions about their health.

Varmand's is usually dirty. it is smoky, and filthy. the ladies bathroom embodies everything i hate in a bathroom - the toilet is too close to the wall, the sink has those push-button knobs, there is an air-hand dryer, and the door opens the wrong way. the patrons are occasionally rowdy, sometimes hostile. i have (more than once) gotten into a fight there with straight people about how gay i am. in all fairness, it may not be totally necessary to discuss lesbian oral sex techniques loudly over your 4th pitcher of beer for the night, except when it *totally is.* \u000a\u000aregardless, this is a typical pittsburgh y*nzer filthy bar, a stand-in for those of us who miss dukes, cheaper than dirt, staffed by wild rogues with hearts of gold, and maintaining totally erratic hours. no, i have never eaten their fish sandwich. i don't eat animal flesh, so i can't tell you if it's as good as they claim.

Vi like this restaurant for a few reasons.  certainly not for the restaurant itself which is not really inviting and definitely most customers take-out or order through mealsdelivered.net.  what is good is their vegetarian selection, and, more importantly, that vegans can actually eat here with good selections.  \u000a\u000ai am not vegan though, so i actually order a few things.  i really like their kabli nan which is nan with golden raisins and almonds in it.  totally delicious and like a dessert.  i usually get the paratha (whole wheat, it's better for you!) and chicken vindaloo, which isn't the best i've had - that is reserved for a place in maryland - but is ok and certainly good value for the amount you pay.  this time around, i also tried the mango lassi (yum!) and the kheer (um, don't order that here, there was a weird taste to it).  \u000a\u000aoverall, the amount of food you get is great for what you pay.  and in general, the food is tasty and spiced decently.  i ordered an 8 in terms of spice and probably really got a 6, but then again, i wasn't there to tell them to make it a real 8.  :)  i would definitely order from here again.

Vwe ordered take-out from here through meals delivered and couldn't be more pleased.  the portions were large and flavorful, and it was a great value ($31 with delivery and tip for an aloo gobi, a chicken tikka masala, plenty of rice and 2 samosas).  i ordered the aloo gobi with a spice level of 5 and thought it was a touch too spicy, but other than that it was very good.  my boyfriend said that the chicken tikka masala was one of the best he's had.  the samosas are just the right size and delicious.\u000a\u000awe will definitely be ordering from here again!

Vit's nice to know that there's decent indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like udipi (which, btw, is worth the trip).  i can't say i thought the restaurant aesthetics were that fantastic.  the acoustics in there are horrible, and it seems kind of dark.  but the service was nice, and the food is great.  beware the stairs of death when you go to the bathroom.\u000a\u000ai haven't seen chicken muglai in years (they call it muglai korma on the menu) and the version they have is excellent.  we also had the sag paneer and a number of other dishes i can't even remember.  all i can recall is that i got my chicken muglai and it was good.  the rest was good too.  i should also note that the portions are pretty large by indian restaurant standards.  one dish goes a long way.\u000a\u000athe nan is a little eh.  a little overcooked, in my estimation.  the garlic nan had lots of garlic on it but little garlic taste.  so, you get all the downside without any of the upside.  too bad.\u000a\u000ain any case, i will most definitely be coming back.  i

Vjust got back from trying the lunch buffet at taste of india, which was pretty good and a definite value.  it is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  the buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  there were also gulab jamuns.\u000a\u000amy favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  the chickpeas were good, but i thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (i am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since i have an awesome recipe that i make at home all the time.)  the watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  total for two people came to $17 before tip.\u000a\u000athis is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is children's hospital staff.  parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  but i really like this place and it's definitely worth it.

Vdonatelli's is absolutely terrific--one of those local gems that make the bloomfield neighborhood so wonderful.  whenever i'm in the area, i make it a point to stop here.  being that i'm half italian, i love coming here.  the help here is really friendly,\u000a\u000aalyson is right, try the biscotti!  as for me, i love the things that you can't really get at giant eagle.  they have terrific imported pastas and italian condiments.  their deli counter is unbeatable--certainly better than the aforementioned giant eagle.  i particularly recommend trying their cheeses!

Vwe were planning our meals for the week, so rick and i decided to head back to donatelli's.  we picked up some of their wonderful pastas.  i was also in the mood to make italian subs for lunches, so i picked up some terrific capicola, mortadella, salami, and provolone.  not only is the provolone good here, so are their other cheeses.  to top off the sandwiches, i bought some imported hot gardeneria mix.  yum!

Vwhenever i'm in bloomfield, i've gotta stop in at donatelli's.  okay, donatelli's was my primary reason for going to bloomfield the other day.  i had to pick up a few of the usual staples.  our fridge was getting mighty low on mozzarella, provolone, and italian lunch meats (the salami was on special, btw!).  ditto for our pantry--it was getting a little shy on the fine imported pastas, biscottis, etc.  gotta restock!

Vyet another review for donatelli's?  \u000a\u000awell let's take a look at the january specials.  imported polish ham for $3.99 lb.  polish ham at an italian store?  okay!  fresh homemade pasta for $2.49 lb!  gonna be having some veal tortellini with spicy italian sausage and my homemade marinara sauce for dinner tonight.  nicholas coffee for $6.99 lib.  we all know that susan doesn't resume the form of a human female until she's had that 2nd cup.

Vfour star food, three star service, and two star ambience.\u000a\u000awent in, got the stink-eye from two or three folks sitting at the bar watching the hockey game.  sat in the dining room, and it was spooky quiet; for the first half of our meal, no one else was there, there wasn't music, and the only other sounds came from the next room, which just felt odd.  atmosphere was bad.\u000a\u000agot the pasta roll, which was absolutely delicious; awesome pasta/pine nuts/spinach under a relatively light red cream sauce.  the salad i had was lackluster, though; wilted greens, dry shredded carrots, and a pepperoncini that was just off; it tasted bitter, which was an all-new, all-bad taste for those.  ew.  five star entree, two star salad, maybe.\u000a\u000athere were two waitresses and only two tables; refills on water were pretty quick up front (several times), but we wound up hanging out for five or ten minutes after we were done eating before seeing our waitress again.\u000a\u000atwo and a half stars?  i'd stop in and get a pasta roll for take-out, maybe, but there's a lot of competition for selling red-sauce italian food in the italian neighborhood, ya know?

Vd'amico's is like...olive garden, only less festive and with more "local color."  we came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a thursday.  we made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  definitely not hoppin'.  the color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  it's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a tv showing a football game in the next room.\u000a\u000aour server was definitely "set in her ways," as one of my coworkers said.  she had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a "does not compute" response across her face....like when i sat down and she asked what i wanted to drink.  i said i was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like "...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?" and i was all "yes, i just got here....i don't even know what i want!" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like "oh, do you need a list or something?"  i know, i'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine i plan to order.  i'm weird like that.  trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  you have to play by her rules.  when we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and i enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  i'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\u000a\u000athe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  they had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  it was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  i liked it, because i like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  the four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  i didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\u000a\u000ai got the pasta roll for my entree.  despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  i didn't think it was well-seasoned - i ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  the texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a bad dish, but it was just...meh.  nothing exciting.  very average.  pretty bland.  i tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  it's just generic stuff.  like i said, olive garden, only local.  considering how "meh" the food was, i think it's way overpriced.\u000a\u000aso i wouldn't go back.  it's not my kind of food, or place.  for all the italian folks around here, i'm sure pittsburgh must have way better italian food offerings than this.

Vhole in the wall - check.  stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.\u000a\u000ai don't really trust a vitnamese restaurant to be really really good unless it is a hole in the wall kind of place.   :)  and this place is good.  now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited menu.  but really, they do everything on the menu so well that you can't really complain.  and the prices are extremely reasonable.  make sure you get the fresh rolls.  i usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top.  and unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.\u000a\u000abyob, so feel free to bring your own alcohol of choice.  i can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, i believe.  and bring cash.

Vpeter b. got it right. order the pho, order the spring rolls, and i'll add order the summer rolls. these are all good. other things are not worth trying. i love pho, and i have it all over the country. tram's is not one of the best. however, when you're in pittsburgh, and you have limited selections, it is the best. for that phofix in da burgh, you gotta go to tram's. \u000a\u000asometimes i think the yelp rating needs to be aware of the circumstances. it's not dumbing down, it's just knowing your surroundings. tram's - you get 4 stars from me. thanks for quenching my pho thirst.

Vwow! i am so glad miss alison suggested this place while we were in town. she's vegan and they have plenty of options for her. we came here with friends for dinner after day 1 of selling at handmade arcade. we got there just in time since it got packed shortly after we sat down. there was a slight language barrier, so instead of getting the chicken with crispy noodles, i got tofu, but you know what? i didn't even notice until 5 minutes after eating and then i looked across the table at my friend jessica's dish that clearly had chicken and we had ordered the same thing. oh well. i don't regret it at all. it was delicious and i ate every bite. also the vegetable gyoza we started with was very tasty. will definitely add this into my rotation of pittsburghian restaurants i hit up when i am there. i heart pittsburgh!

Vfor many people in pittsburgh, tram's is the only place to be to get pho.  for me though, whenever i go, i always leave disappointed wanting more.  their saving grace?  their spring rolls are easily some of the best of the vietnamese variety in the area.\u000a\u000ai find their pho to have small portions and to be of inconsistent quality.  if the i find the broth is good, they might ruin it by dumping a good 6 shakes of black pepper all over everything before they serve it (wtf?).  other times, they might serve beef cooked well done as opposed to the rare which i prefer.  or maybe they will give me my beef rare, except the broth will be so lukewarm that zero residual heat passes on to the beef.\u000a\u000atheir spring rolls though are good.  fresh and wrapped tightly, they help make the long wait time it takes for pho to be brought out more manageable.

Vi really wanted to  give this a great review, because i have very fond memories of this place when i was a kid with my mom and also when i was in my early 20's hitting this place after 3 am.  alas,  i went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu.  i give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables (sopranos finale style) and i thought our server was great.  she easily had been doing this for 40+ years.  the atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too.  i was here this morning with my friend fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night.  the coffee was good and plentiful.  we never had less than half a cup.  i had two poached eggs and white toast.  the eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter.  all in all this was pretty good.  my bacon was also fine with three healthy strips.  however, fiona was less lucky.  she had a veggie omelette which was average at best, size doesn't matter with respect to omelettes i'd rather less eggs, but super beaten so the omelette is light.  the veggies were plentiful, but i'd prefer the veggies lightly sauteed, so texturely there isn't such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables.  the sausage was good, but cold.  she asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't crispy at all, in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine.  the homefries were okay, but i prefer a little more crust on the potatoes.  i'd say this is a perfectly acceptable diner, but i'd recommend you'll enjoy your meal much better if it's at 2 am in the morning as opposed to 10 am on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the tequila.

Vi've only been here after 2 am, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.\u000a\u000ai've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, i've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and i've witnessed an armed robbery.  the food is decent, for the hours they're open.  \u000a\u000atry tom's diner or eat 'n park instead.  heck, go to a grocery store instead.

Vthe food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. i love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. i have only been to (c)ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when pittsburgh's finest come out to play. never a dull moment.

Vif i had to give you just one reason to return to this establishment it would be that they have table jukeboxes. filled with ridiculous music that of course you want to listen to. fifty cents a play and it only takes quarters. it's easy to have your own little dance party in the booth.\u000a\u000aas many have said before, cash only. so if you don't already have your cash or stopped at an atm, no need to worry there is an atm right as you walk in.  not sure if its like this all the time, but it's a seat yourself type of establishment.  when we were there the place wasn't too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor.  i love the fact that the server wears scrubs being in close proximity to shadyside hospital (of course don't expect surgery here).\u000a\u000athe place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling. it's hideous, and i love it. from the booths to the counter seats (where i assume you have to be a regular to sit there). even the desert case at the register, sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you.  the bathrooms are typical and scary. i walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water. \u000a\u000athe food, hmm the food. what an interesting array of food to have for this place. from grape leaves to meatloaf. speaking of meatloaf, that's what i had. two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side. i also opted for the side salad, which was simple with iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and green pepper. and the fresh (is it really fresh?) bread that they give you is amazing.\u000a\u000aif this place is this good at night, i can only imagine what it's like during the day.

Vafter many years of going past this place, i finally had the chance to go in and check out the food! as soon as you enter ritter's diner, right there in front of you is an atm- credit/debit cards are not accepted. the dcor is not modern, but it still adds to the diner's charm. the waitresses, who wear hospital scrubs as their uniforms, were friendly, but they seemed rather tired while i was there. nonetheless, my waitress was attentive and provided efficient service. ritter's diner is open 24/7 and whatever is on the menu can be ordered any time of day. so for brunch, i ordered a steak breakfast that came with eggs, home fries and toast. everything was delicious! i am so pleased with my first experience at ritters dinner that i will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!

Vit's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place.  but, i feel the need to re-iterate just how great these burgers are.  after a very long night i woke up in my hotel room feeling the effects of the previous night.  had a friend in from delaware and he actually suggested we go after seeing it featured on the food network.  we were there before they opened and actually waited for them to unlock the doors.  i had a gourmet burger cooked perfectly.  the meat had a ton of flavor and it was grilled perfectly.  the  hash browns were a nice change than fries and the coleslaw actually tasted great and wasn't just a "throw away" side.  my friend chose a burger with no cheese or condiments just to savor the burger in it's pure form.  true to the hype my friend declared what i'm sure has been spoken many times that this is the "best burger he's ever had".

Vtessaro's is definitely the best burger you'll find in pittsburgh. their sides are also delicious. if you have vegetarian friends that protest, they have vegetable kabobs that are actually really good as well. if you love burgers and you're in pittsburgh, you'll have to try it out. if you've been but haven't gone back in a while, what are you waiting for?\u000a\u000aduring peak meal hours, the wait can be about 15-30 minutes. the staff is friendly and helpful - they know that they serve a mean burger, and they are happy to be part of it all. \u000a\u000aone warning, be prepared to be stuffed.

Vif you have a vegetarian friend who only eats meat once a year, the burger here is worth a shot.  easily the best hamburger in the city, as other restaurants claim "second best burger in town" in deference.

Vtessaro's is a-ok, since they're famous for the burgers that's exactly what i had there - a classic cheeseburger with cheddar, medium-rare. the burger was soft and juicy but otherwise rather plain, the cheddar cheese didn't add enough flavor to it. the decor is a little interesting - denim tablecloth, wood and vinyl booths, and red christmas bows on the lamps? my big gripe with the place was the lack of space between tables. when we were seated, the hostess had to literally pull the table out, let me and my friend sit and then push it in, so we were nice and tight between the benches and the table. when a couple next to us had to leave, we had to pull the table out again...

Vtessaro's was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across america.  i've had famous burgers such as the ones at mr. bartley's up in ma or the french bread burgers down at rotier's in nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.\u000a\u000aafter it all, i still see tessaro's as one of the best burgers i've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh as fresh gets).  i started out with medium rare burgers when i first started going there, but eventually i toned down the knob to rare.  my cheese choice is always a slice of american.\u000a\u000ai typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since tessaro's serves up "pub burgers", i find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  there is never a reason to add ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor quality.  ketchup on a good burger is like heading to a prime steakhouse and asking for a1.  save it for when you overcook your burgers at home or when you're at mcdonald's.  mustard is okay in reasonable quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.\u000a\u000amy first thought was wow. these buns are huge. the top bun was awkwardly round and i had squish it a little to get a first bite that consisted of both burger and bun. it worked out in the end, as the buns were able to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult to hold. the patty itself was perfectly cooked. a full half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. i'm not sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but i want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect in my book. the beef itself had an amazing texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. the beef itself tasted remarkably fresh and just the right amount of "beefy". i usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked and dry; however, at tessaro's, this was not the case. the slice of american cheese was perfectly melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. the lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity from the two tomato slices balanced out the cheese. the soggy pickles were overshadowed by the red onion slices which offered not only a crunch but also a spicy kick, and i did not notice them at all.\u000a\u000amy side choice is always home fries.  they come slightly charred and taste of delicious butter.  i had half my portion "naked" and paired the half with the traditional heinz ketchup. honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing beforehand already. with the addition of the heinz, the subtle tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.\u000a\u000awhen you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  when you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  when you go to tessaro's you order a burger.

Vi can understand why some people give this place 5 stars and some shrug their shoulders and say nothing special.\u000a\u000athe burgers here are ground fresh by an in house butcher and the meat is good, not greasy and very juicy. imho, if you added some ground chuck you would get even better flavor but overall they have some of the best tasting burger meat out there.\u000a\u000athey cook on a griddle that is heated by burning hard woods, an interesting concept but to be honest i could not taste any smokiness to the meat. also, imho, grilled meat tastes better, but griddled meat is juicer.\u000a\u000athe burgers are served on what appears to be a portuguese style bun, rather plain tasting they add very little to the burger itself. toppings are simple lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. their goal is to highlight the meat and not cover it up with lots of toppings or sauces.\u000a\u000aon the side i had the home-fries, which they suggested, and to be honest they were disgustingly gross. overcooked lumps of potato and onions saturated in grease that not only looked bad but didn't taste very good either.\u000a\u000ai like the ambience of the local burger joint, but thought a burger for $ 9.00 was pretty spendy. service was good.\u000a\u000abottom line:\u000a\u000asome of the best meat that i've had in a burger, it was cooked perfectly and very juicy - skip those home fires (yuck).\u000a \u000aif you are burger purist, enjoying a plain all american hamburger with nothing fancy you will love tessaro's, if however, you like a more complicated burger with lots of dressings / sauces and complex toppings you will find tessaro's lacking.\u000a\u000aso why three stars? 1 off for the home fires and 1 off for not grilling the burger over that hardwood.

Vthe burger was pretty good but, i've had much better. tables are really close to each other like others have said. what i really didn't like about this place was the service. we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills. we were rushed through our meals like we weren't wanted! i mean they weren't crowded or anything. there was one other table of people besides us on the dining side and maybe 10 people at the bar. \u000a\u000ai should have went to five guy's! i would have been much happier!

V"you're in the hot seat tonight. that's where christian bale sat on thursday!" said our sweet waitress to my husband. "he had the bluest eyes. i was going to ask him if they were contacts, until i realized who it was."\u000a\u000aperhaps needless to say, i proceeded to spend most of the rest of dinner imagining what it would be like to have dinner with christian bale, but each time i was brought back to reality by a bite of my tasty burger. i went with a traditional american cheeseburger, while christian, i mean, my husband, got the gourmet burger. both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. no french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. they were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. so, i plan to return and give some other menu items a try. prices are very reasonable, and i'd say easily the best burger i've had in pittsburgh (though it's no vortex burger!!). \u000a\u000aand, by the way, mr. bale is an excellent tipper.

Vreally good burgers.  old school.  the unique thing about the burgers is the wood smoked taste.  i ordered the home fries as a side and they were excellent.  my son ordered the potato salad, and that was also very good.

Vwhen i first moved to the city i drove by the pleasure bar all the time thinking it was a strip club. imagine my surprise when jb suggested we go there for dinner one night!\u000a\u000aeverything was tasty - we ordered the assorted fried platter that came with mozz sticks (pretty basic but hey! the cheese was still inside all of them!!!), fried zucchini and potato balls (plump little balls fried crispy on the outside and bursting with creamy whipped potato goodness on the inside). bruschetta was full of flavor as was the rolled eggplant.\u000a\u000aplenty of parking (paid) in the back of the restaurant.\u000a\u000aevery time we are there we have the same server, jim, which is cool by us because he's pretty top notch .

Vyou want people to keep coming back here?  keep doing what you are doing here.  a comedic performance will definitely keep me coming back.  i'm not even sure if the lady i saw behind/by the bar even worked there, but she definitely entertained me.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is light and fun inside making it feel like you are possibly at somebody's house party rather than at a bar.  i only came to partake in libations, so i cannot speak to the food here.  \u000a\u000athis place seems to be a favorite haunt for the locals that live nearby as everyone seemed to know everyone.  it was like one big family get together.  kind of like cheers meets central perk.

Vwe had heard good things about this little neighborhood bar, good beer selection (check), cheerful service (check), good prices on drinks (check), and food (check), and supposedly good food.\u000a\u000athe only problem that our party of 6 had was the way the place was set up, they don't allow smoking inside but they should of. all of the smokers were standing outside in front of a giant sliding, garage style door and all of the smoke was sucked back into the bar. \u000a\u000aall of us agreed this is the worst place we have been in for smoke and some of our group were smokers, they didn't even like it. so if your idea is to sit inside a smokey hazy bar you will love it, but to sit in that atmosphere and dine was impossible. we left for cleaner air.

Vi love boston market!\u000a\u000athis location is right near shadyside hospital in the bloomfield, shadyside area of pittsburgh. this location has a large sit down area and a drivethru if your in a hurry to get your food. they are always nice and the food always tastes great! i get the same thing everytime i'm here. no need to look at the menu. i always get the 3 piece dark individual meal. a rotisserie chicken meal that comes with one thigh and two legs and two sides. i always get mac & cheese, creamed spinach and sweet potato casserole as my sides.\u000a\u000ayummo!

Vi'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.\u000a\u000aboston market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the internet, the order is sent to the store that you select and you just go and pick it up.  humph, that's where the happiness stops.  just because you send your order in and are given a time for pick up does not mean that your order will be ready.  also be sure to print out your "invoice" prior to going or they will literally argue with you that you order is complete.  out of five orders, only two were done correctly.  so that meant the estimated twenty minutes on the "invoice" actually turned into about 45 minutes.  would have been easier to drive here, walk into the store and wait for the order to be done.\u000a\u000aand prices weren't really that great.  food not as good either, the meatloaf i ordered has several pieces of gristle in it.  and if i hadn't asked for gravy to put on it, it would have been dry beyond believe.\u000a\u000aas the stars say, "meh.  i've experienced better."

Vhonesty today must have been forgotten.  i called ahead prior to showing up here to inquire about a basic oil change.  on the phone i relayed my car model and type and was quoted at $43.  a bit steep for an oil change, but for a place that is suppose to be able to get you in and out in a very short amount of time, i could see the charge.\u000a\u000awhen i arrived, i pulled up, said what i needed, got out of my car, handed over my keys and then went in to sit down and wait.  after only about three minutes a technician came in and told me a nice little story about how my car needed synthetic oil.  and that they were going to charge me $70 for it.  funny thing was that i had my oil changed before and no one ever told me it needed synthetic oil.  lies.  when i refused to pay that amount they promptly said that they could knock off $15.  i'm sorry, but $55 is still more than what was quoted to me on the phone.  they then wanted me to sign a waiver to put in regular oil.  i just had to look at them and ask if they heard me.  i again refused, went to work, and found a more reliable place with a better price.

Vi'm surprised lot 17 hasn't been reviewed more on yelp. it really is a quality restaurant and bar. they have a solid menu with good food, not just mediocre bar eats. i highly recommend their burgers and sandwiches. they have a lot of different options like cajun chicken breast, turkey reuben, and salmon blt. personally, i don't do salads, but my co-workers have been pleased with their salads too. get their sweet potato fries, too. their honey butter dipping sauce is scrumptious!.\u000a\u000ai also truly appreciate the ambiance at lot 17 - it's like the old meets the new. they've incorporated clean, dark colors of their bar, seats, booths, tables to the old rustic look of the building. the service is friendly and attentive. i've had only one bad experience when they were understaffed during happy hour, but they were very apologetic about it.\u000a\u000a"refined bar food" is what one local paper said about lot 17. i agree, but i'll add delicious to that.

Vpittsburgh is a town where "bar food" means the exact same menu in every last place you'd drink a beer, with the fryer in heavy rotation.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend and i both had sandwiches, and they were among the best i ever recall eating.  i had a portabella mushroom sandwich, and at no point did i wish i'd just ordered a burger.  \u000a\u000aas far as bar food goes, this is the best i know.\u000a\u000aedit: went back and was less impressed; dropping this from 5 to 4 stars.  nothing particularly wrong, but not in the "best thing ever" category.  still really solid.

Vthis is my go to place when i am craving a turkey burger.  i cannot complain at all.  the size of the burger is great, especially when i have that craving.  it amazes me.  of course i make sure to get all the toppings i can, they all seem to go nicely on that kaiser roll.  side of fries is a must albeit it is hard to decide which type to choose from.  regular old fries, sweet potato fries or cajun fries, it's so hard to pick the right one (or maybe an excuse to come back again and again and pair it up differently).\u000a\u000aone thing that i always definitely do here is find the pittsburgh earthquake crack.  not much is out there information wise for this event, but i always make sure to find it.

Vi'm not really a big fan of going out and eating italian since many of the pasta dishes prepared at restaurants seem like they came from the frozen section of the local grocery store, i can do that at home and save some money, thank you very much. \u000a\u000aalexanders is very different. you can tell the sauces are all freshly made and there is a great selection of them. i recommend the gorgonzola basil cream sauce. the menu has all the classic italian favorites and the specials menu always has mouth watering seasonal items on it as well. the whole family can enjoy alexander's. \u000a\u000agreat italian food, very reasonable prices and huge portions make this our go-to italian eatery.

Vwe ended up at sammy's famous corned beef after trying to get pho at tram's kitchen and forgetting it was a monday (tram's is closed on mondays).  the bright neon lights flashing famous across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.\u000a\u000ai ordered the sammy's special, which is 5 ounces of corned beef topped with sauerkraut or cole slaw, swiss cheese, and russian dressing on your choice of rye.  i went with sauerkraut and rye bread.  i also got a side of potato salad b/c it costs a buck and i was kinda worried i'd still be a little hungry after the sandwich.  the sandwich was alright; the corned beef wasn't as salty as i expected and sliced really thin.  i would've liked my bread toasted, the heat of the meat and sauerkraut warmed up the bread from the inside.  toasted bread might have also held up to the wetness of the sauerkraut and russian dressing; the bread was extremely soggy by my last bite.\u000a\u000aone of my companions said their pastrami was underwhelming and to stick with corned beef (he had two sandwiches).\u000a\u000athe potato salad was pretty standard with a dijon mustard base.  \u000a\u000athey also have a bar in the dining section of the place, but since it was around 2:30 pm in the afternoon i decided not to get a beer at that time.\u000a\u000aoverall i was satisfied with my meal and i'd probably drop by again if i was in the area, but i probably wouldn't go out of my way to get their sandwich.

Vi must write a review for this restaurant!  :)\u000a\u000ai have lived in pittsburgh for almost 8 years now and luckily found this thai restaurant early in my move.  let me start with a little story.  my sister lived in northern california and was visiting.  we were talking about places to eat and i of course mentioned and suggested thai cuisine, knowing how good their food is.  my sister was skeptical, to say the least, mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the san francisco area, could a place in pittsburgh actually be that good if not better than restaurants in ca?  i decided to let the food speak for itself  --- and it did!  my sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she loved it.  in fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best she had had - and that it was too bad that it was in pittsburgh.  \u000a\u000ame personally?  i love the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and i am not vegan or vegetarian.  i would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  the crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  the soups are all pretty great.  \u000a\u000ayou should try this restaurant, it will definitely be worth your time.  and if you like your food spicy, like i do, make sure you tell them you want it thai spicey at 10 out of 10!  :)

Vthai cuisine was very good and might be deserving of 5 stars but i have only been there once and there were a couple of items that knocked it down to 4.\u000a\u000ai started with tom yum veggie, it was loaded wit lots of fresh vegetables, the broth had a little too much lime in it for me and the idea of adding extra heat with chili flakes was okay but overall the broth lacked any sort of flavor outside of base, lime, chili flakes. \u000a\u000ai had the spciy basill noodles, this dish was excellent very similar to pad kee mao but it had egg and bell pepper in it. this dish alone deserved 5 stars.\u000a\u000amy only other critique is that i had ginger tea and it was westernized version, on the sweet side and lacking the spiciness of true ginger tea.\u000a\u000awith my little nit-picks aside i currently highly recommend this dining establishment, not that they need much help, they were very busy as they should be - go enjoy.

Va lot to choose from and i have scored a few awesome items but i often walk out empty handed. prices are high for a thrift store. some belts and clothing are sold at nearly retail prices. i've even seen clothes with store price tags still attached but were being sold for more. don't bother asking for help because you'll get a huff and an eye roll. cash only and the atm inside is frequently out of order.

Vorganization people, that's all i got to say, organization.  this place is in dire need of it.  or maybe a map of some sort, but not like a treasure map.  i walked in to try and find a picture frame to use for a project and it took me forever to figure out that they were buried behind the knickknack area.\u000a\u000aalso, the staff might want to take a people skills course.  not a good experience to have them weaving in and out of customers much like a stunt car driver to avoid a question.  i really loved overhearing their conversations...\u000a\u000aone other thing, make sure you work out a bit, that ramp connecting the levels is not fun to conquer when you're not expecting it.

Vi only stopped here once, on the way to a party at a friend's house.  thus, i can only give it three stars.  i needed a cake in a hurry and kribel's was able to fill the bill!  i also picked up some bread for sandwiches.  i have to say this--the bread was outstanding!  it's so yummy, all i wanted to do was slather some good ol' butter on it!\u000a\u000athey also make a concoction that i didn't try--the good luck pretzel.  their website is here http://kribelsbakeryofpittsburgh.com/ and you can read about these pretzels here http://kribelsbakeryofpittsburgh.com/goodluckpretzels.html  kribel's supposedly has really good birthday cakes.

Vi love carhops! i have been going there for years! they also have a location in monroeville. \u000a\u000athey have hoagies, burgers, fries, wings ,salads sandwiches etc. every hoagie is named after a car. you have two choices in sandwich sizes, coupe - 1ft and sedan - 2ft. they offer cheesesteaks, chicken, reubens and italian subs.\u000a\u000ai love their burgers too. all of which are named after lamborghini's such as the diablo, countach, espada, muira and jalpa. my favorite burger is the jalpa. it consist of a cheeseburger with melted cheddar cheese and bacon and is outstanding!\u000a\u000athere is also a full bar in the back.\u000a\u000amake sure you try the home made ice tea! it is outstanding!\u000a\u000acash only!

Vnice atmosphere, good food - sesame inn gets an a in my book.  the service is good - i especially like the man who has been refilling water glasses since i was in middle school and always smiles at you.  there is a room off the main dining room to support larger groups, a full bar, and a great menu.  the lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.\u000a\u000aas far as the food goes, everything is delicious.  the hot and sour soup is great, the ma po bean curd is the best i've ever had, and even their newest offering of pad thai is pretty good.  whether you're taking out, eating in, or having food delivered, everything here is delicious.

Van article i once read in the tribune-review said that chinese food has gone from exotic to good old fashioned american comfort food.  it's also what you get when you're too tired to cook or when you're running around, getting last minute shopping done.  \u000a\u000aas my cousin cindy & i were.  we met up at the galleria, which is kinda-sorta half way between downtown (where i work) and bethel park (where she lives).  \u000a\u000achina gate--mark pi's food can best be described as what you'd get in a typical strip mall chinese place, only in a more upscale setting.  the decor here is actually very nicely done.  the food though is your everyday americanized chinese chow.  you've got your eggdrop and wonton soups, your eggrolls and springrolls, your pot stickers, and your typical chicken, beef, and seafood dishes here.  and of course your general tso's chicken.  \u000a\u000ai went for their amazing chicken--fried chicken in a cherry sauce with broccoli on the side.  i believe my cousin went for orange chicken.  and of course we each had the hot-n-sour soup and an eggroll.  \u000a\u000athe food here is good, but it's really nothing you haven't seen before.  and you'll notice that a surprisingly large number of menu items are fried.  on the whole, if you're in the mood for some chinese, or if you want something else besides chain places, you'll get a decent meal here.

Vi don't make it here nearly often enough *sigh*...\u000a\u000athis place is sooo good!  a friendly fun atmosphere with great great great neapolitan pizza.  i actually managed to order something other than pizza (a couple of pasta dishes) and that was fabulous!  my parents are not usually fans of italian food, but even they agreed that il pizzaiolo had great food and didn't complain!  :)  the wine flights are also fun and affordable even if not the best wine.\u000a\u000aparking can be a pain at night and on weekends - probably because there is likely to be a line for this place...  try for lunch or an early dinner.

Vokay, okay, i finally get it. i've been told about this place for years and finally stopped in on friday night around 8 pm.  i guess i'm not the only person who likes pizza on a friday night because it was packed.  however, we were escorted out back to a beautiful wine bar with great dark lighting, comfy furniture and additional seating.  the bar itself was pretty small, maybe 8 seats and the place was packed.  it didn't affect our service which was quite good and no one in the group waited for a drink.  the crowd was (i hate this word) "trendy" and most were laughing and having fun.  the wine seemed to be relatively reasonable priced, however i'd like more options than just italian wine.  we sampled a charcutterie platter which was amazing.  the meats were top notch and flavorful.  the hummus and olives were some of the best i've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. the best i've ever had.  after a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  wow, the pizza truly the best i've had in the burgh'.  i love mineos, aiellos, and fioris as much as the next but this is in a different league.  we ordered the neoplolitan pizza which is very simple, light, thin crust and amazing flavor.  as another yelper mentioned this is one of only 16 pizza places in the states to be certified to serve authentic neopolitan pizza.  we also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.  it's one of the best pies i've had coast to coast and i'd stack up against ray's or any other historic pizza joint in nyc.  i'd give it 5 stars if it had better parking and a better wine selection.

Vfinally - a pittsburgh restaurant with a decent outside patio!  patio is in the back, so you don't get all the road noise, and is quite pleasant.  in fact, we got seated in the back corner by the fountain, which is not a normal table, but one of those stone garden tables.  despite not being the most comfortable of seats, it was by far the most enchanting part of the patio.\u000a\u000ai thought the pizza was "eh." the dough was a little "doughy' for my taste.  i was significantly more impressed with my pasta dish, which was incredibly delicious, but also incredibly rich, so i had to leave about half of it.  i guess that's what i get for ordering pastas with cream sauce.\u000a\u000ain summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  i didn't find the inside half as exciting.  i'll give them another chance on the pizza, but even if you don't have that, try the pasta.

Vlittle tokyo is the restaurant where i first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  however, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, i still believe little tokyo is one of the best.  for one, i have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  little tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  my favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  the atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-homecoming dinner.  the service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  they will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.\u000a\u000ai would highly recommend little tokyo, especially over sushi two (or three, i never can remember) on beverly road.

Va pretty good place to see a show.  it doesn't quite have the panache that the loews in homestead nor the eclectic mix that the squirrel hill and manor have.  but it's a nice, clean multi-plex in an upscale mall.  they show a lot of movies that appeal to the local population and, yes, that does include an "art house" or "indie" flick or too.\u000a\u000aworth checking out if you're in the area.

Vthis place was scheduled to be closed on june 17, 2010.  fortunately they worked out an agreement with the mall owners and will stay in business.  they're also expanding into family fare.  that's great 'cos too many pittsburgh theatres have bitten the dust recently including the squirrel hill, the norwin, screenworks, etc.

Vi adored uptown coffee as a middle- and high-school student, mostly due to its proximity to the school.  it is a great, mellow place to hang out for hours.  their drinks and desserts are always delicious, and they used to serve sandwiches.  they seem to have gone through a makeover since i graduated, and now it is much better lit, though the much-beloved couch is no longer.\u000auptown coffee is a great alternative to starbucks and a great place to spend a few hours catching up with friends.

Vwho likes going to the hospital?  almost no one!  but the care you receive and the kindness of the staff turns an otherwise unpleasant event into something more bearable.\u000a\u000ai've been going to this hospital ever since i was a young woman.  when i was in my late-teens to mid-twenties, i had to have three surgeries done.  i stayed at magee, and as difficult a period of time that was for me, they helped me get through it, in physical and mental and emotional care.  their aftercare was wonderful and they were able to refer me to some emotional support, which i desperately needed during this time.\u000a\u000atheir ob-gyn services here are second-to-none.  my ob-gyn and my general practioner are both affiliated with magee.  i wouldn't go anywhere else for my needs!

Vi am writing an update to magee women's hospital.  my attitude towards them has not changed.  this is still the best place for a woman to get healthcare, especially ob-gyn services.  but it will soon be the tenth anniversary of my second of three surgeries i had to have done.  in looking back, i don't know how i could have had them done anywhere else.\u000a\u000athe second surgery was bad enough, the third was even more serious because it involved a life-changing decision.  instead of being very cold about it, i was given my options and told calmly and with empathy, "susan, this has to be done".  and i'm telling you that despite the difficult choice i had to make, they guided me through the entire process.

Va nice alternative to the starbucks down the street. this location is fairly large with couches & comfy chairs in the back by the fire. their coffee is better than average, and the baristas have been friendly. a nice place to hang out on weekend mornings. if you don't find anything yummy to eat here, try the bakery across the street before grabbing your coffee.

Vthis is simply a great place to shop, or come and just have a look!  the thing to remember is this--eons is a very small shop and it's best to come here on a weekday when they aren't so overwhelmed.  \u000a\u000alike the nearby hey betty!, what they have here is usually first-rate.   they do not sell junk here (no salvation army thrift store this) but rather high quality antique clothing, many one-of-a-kind.  like all good vintage shops, it can be a bit pricey, but if you're willing to sift and look hard, you can usually find something you want.  the clothes on their racks look clean, and are in good condition.\u000a\u000ai'm not into vintage for everyday wear, but i play bass in a bar band and every so often i love wearing vintage clothes on stage.

Vthere are thrift stores and there are vintage stores.  there are some stores that are a blend of the two.  and then there's eons.  eons goes beyond your average vintage shop in that it could be considered a museum of fashion.   a lot of their stuff is one-of-a kind antique clothing.  you can easily find stuff from the 1930s up to the 1980s.  heck, in a few years we'll be looking at 1990s grunge here--time to dig out the soundgarden cds.  i once bought a clutch purse here.  \u000a\u000ai stopped in the other day and even though i couldn't find anything that quite caught my eye, it was still a lot of fun poking around in here.

Vi have walked past this store on so many occasions, but never thought to actually walk in here until today.  being a creature of pittsburgh i have been doing the whole neighborhood thing.  that is to pick a neighborhood, browse almost every store in that neighborhood and then rave to everyone for about a week how great that neighborhood is for shopping.  well this week my friends i will tell you that because of eons, shadyside will be spewed upon all my friends and anyone that comes my way asking where they should go to shop.\u000a\u000ai must say, i hesitated at the door for a bit, mentally prepping myself to enter this store.  i hate when i walk into a store and cannot find anything i want.  so i prepped myself just in case that happened.  once i walked in, i put myself at ease and just let myself browse and browse and browse.  for the small space that the store occupies, they sure do know how to jam pack all racks and shelves to the maximum.\u000a\u000ai was greeted almost right away as soon as i walked in the door.  of course the obligating question once you enter a clothing store of any type is, "welcome, can i help you find anything?"  of course i did what any typical person would do stared at them and eventually replied with, "no thank you, this is my first time in here."  i think i puzzled them with that response.  then i just went where my mind guided me...which would have been to the shoes.  i found a swank pair of tan and white shoes that i couldn't take my eyes off of.  after about five minutes of me staring at them the guy asked me if i wanted to try them on, of course i wanted to try them on.  i wanted to hug them if i could.  not only did he give me one shoe to try on, but unlike other places, allowed me to try the other shoe and yes, i did a little turn on the catwalk to make sure they were right for me.  and i will admit, i watched myself in the big mirror as i walked back and forth in front of it.\u000a\u000ai also browsed a few more racks and shelves to make sure i wasn't neglecting any other items.  good thing i did, i found the perfect vest to compliment the shoes (and once i got home i noticed it was reversible, bonus!).\u000a\u000ayou know you had walked into an amazing business when you see that every non-filtered review here on yelp is above par.  i'm also glad to add another one of those reviews.

Vyou simply have to visit this shop, they have the best quality vintage clothing and really excellent customer service.  the store feels cramped, but then again it is packed with a great selection of vintage clothes.  everything is laid out very logically, and the prices are quite reasonable, especially given the quality.  \u000a\u000ain particular, you will find a great selection of men's bow ties, and i have looked unsuccessfully for these at other stores.\u000a\u000aone more thing, the owner supports the local community, he is continually helping out non-profits by donating or loaning merchandise and by publicizing their events.

Vi am not a fan of this place.  they are certainly convenient for shadyside, and i don't think their prices are out of control.  but they do have quality issues with alterations.\u000a\u000ai didn't have any problems with the dry cleaning, but brought some pants in to get hemmed.  first time i went back to pick them up, they told me they were out to be pressed.  not sure why it should be sent out to be pressed, especially since i had come a few days later than indicated on my ticket, but ok.  second time i come back to pick up the pants, the pins were still in the fabric - nothing had been done to them.  so not only were they not done, someone clearly lied to me about where they were the first time around.  finally got them on the third try, and i insisted on a discount.  but when i brought them home, i looked at the hem job and it was low quality.  they just flipped the fabric up and sewed along the hem, rather than tucking the cut edge under and then hemming.  i expected better, given the price.

V2.5 rounding up. while i'm not too thrilled with the customer service, i am content with the dry cleaning. jb & i dropped off two of his suits, two dress shirts, and our 1250 thread count egyptian cotton comforter on a wednesday. we got a call on saturday morning saying that our items were ready for pick up and my debit card was found in the pocket of one of his suits. \u000a\u000a(side note: i noticed that i misplaced it 4 days prior) \u000a\u000ai went to pick up the items and the clerk acted surprised when i gave her 2 tickets and checked our order then told me that the dress shirts weren't ready, they were waiting for the next shipment that would probably arrive in 45 minutes. \u000a\u000ai told her that i'd like to pay for and pick up what was ready then made a joke about how it figures with my luck, the same day i get a call about my atm card i get my new one in the mail. "you didn't get a call about your card?" she asked. "yes, today" i replied. "yeah, that was me that called, but its been here for 2 days. i can't believe no one else called". \u000a\u000abecause i noticed it right away and ordered a new one as soon as i possibly could, it wouldn't have mattered to me if they called sooner but if someone didn't take the proactive measures i did, those 2 days it took them to call and notify would have made a huge difference. \u000a\u000athe clerk proceeded to bring out the suits and cash me out when i asked her if the comforter was coming with the shirts, she then put on her surprised look again and thanked me for reminding her. she rummaged through some things and finally found my comforter and i was on my way. i'm picking up the shirts tomorrow, hopefully it wont be such an ordeal.

Vbeen coming to this restaurant for years, before the fire that caused the entire renovation of the place you now go to.   obviously, i like the food, good quality, a perfect serving size, and the amuse bouche is a nice touch!  the wine selection by the glass is pretty decent.  service is always great.\u000a\u000athe bar area is fun and definitely a place for young professionals out for a drink, to hang, and to meet others.  at night, for the late-night menu, you can even get a few selections made from their neighbors, umi!

Vatmosphere is very nice - quiet without feeling like a library, nice lighting, decent and eclectic music mix.  service was excellent.  the clientele was mixed on friday night - a couple with a child, two couples double-dating, people just getting drinks, etc.\u000a\u000aonto the food.  the pacific rim drink was fruity and not too strong, and also reasonably priced.  the crispy tofu appetizer is awesome.  if i lived closer, i would want it all the time.  the high crispiness level means it was probably deep fried, but it's so yummy i didn't even care.\u000aspicy cucumber raita (amuse bouche) with flatbread was also delicious.  i kind of want a jar of it at home to put on sandwiches or something.\u000aas far as entrees, boyfriend had the beef brisket which he said was excellent and very tender.  i had the citrus tofu curry, which was just ok.  if i were a chef, i would have balanced out the very sweet citrus sauce with a little soy sauce or something savory.  the portions were more than big enough.\u000aand for dessert, we had the vietnamese coffee creme brle, which was beyond delicious.\u000a\u000ai generally enjoyed the meal, but would appreciate maybe one more vegetarian entree to give diners a choice.  also, a head's up: the adjoining parking lot is small, so if you have a reservation or are meeting people, make sure you allow time to find alternative parking if the lot is full.

Voverrated.  completely overrated.\u000a\u000aafter reading all the rave reviews and hearing about how amazing soba was, i went there last night with two companions.  we started off with an order of calamari and tuna tartar.  what came out even before our appetizers was a complementary cucumber salad (it appeared that every table got it).  i found the flavor of the cucumber salad the best part of dinner.  the cool cucumbers were complemented with a slightly spicy sauce, which were served with slices of pita bread.  even though our waiter went on about how the calamari was different than other restaurants, it was strikingly similar to the overly breaded calamari at the cheesecake factory.  it wasn't heavily seasoned, and most of the flavor came from the garlic sauce and freshly squeezed lime juice.  i preferred the tuna tartar over the calamari, as the the flavors melded well together with just the right amount of bite from citrus notes.  these were served with house made potato chips, which were sliced thin and fried golden with just the right amount of crunch.\u000a\u000afor entrees, my companions ordered our server's #1 and #2 recommendations of seared rare tuna and boneless pork chop, and i ordered the wok seared sea scallops, since i've been having a craving for large plump sea scallops for some time.  one companion asked a rhetorical question of why everything that is labeled as "asian fusion" or "exotic" has to be spicy, which we could not answer.  his seared rare tuna was a tuna steak cooked rare topped with the korean "gochujang" mellowed out with some soy and probably sugar (that's where the fusion plays in, instead of kiwi or pear juice).  he mentioned that he liked the ginger fried rice, even though the rice was probably one day old (fried rice is traditionally made with leftover rice).  my other companion received a 10 oz. thick cut pork chop.  being so thick and also pork, the meat was flavorless and dry.  i sampled a piece from the outside edge and one cut from the center; the first piece had the flavor form the char, but the center cut one was so bland i could not finish it.  the defining part of the dish was it's spicy chili honey sauce, as it made the pork edible.  the grits were ok, not amazing, but not bad.  two five oz. pork chops would've probably done the dish more justice than that 10 oz monstrosity.  meats that need to be cooked through should not be thick cut unless it's well marbled, and we all know how hard it is to find marbled pork nowadays.  last, my dish consisted of around 4 oz. of rice cakes cooked in an overly salty "sauce" with pork and bok choy topped with four seared sea scallops.  for some reason, i was expecting my sea scallops to be around 30% larger in diameter, but realistically being in pittsburgh the only scallops that are available are ones that are shipped from the coast.  the scallops were seared perfectly (but honestly now, searing sea scallops is not difficult).  the rice cakes were cooked properly, but they were miniscule in size and thickness, and overly salty from the "spicy" sauce, which had maybe quarter of a clove of minced garlic, and half a seeded chili pepper.  the bok choy was cooked beyond recognition, and basically became a sponge for the soy sauce.  the few strips of julienned pork was probably 2 oz. meat, and did not fit well with the dish as it got lost in the sauce.  dishes that are soupy in nature should have larger pieces of meat; only dishes that have more solid food than liquid should be allows to use small pieces of meat.  i was not impressed at all.  yes, i keep switching between soup and sauce; it's labeled as a sauce in the menu, and it was definitely too salty to be a soup, but it's consistency was that of soup, and it was served with one of those soup spoons you get with egg drop soup in asian restaurants.\u000a\u000afor it's price, soba should've been much better.  i would've given soba two stars, but our waiter was attentive and the ambiance was nice.

Vhow have i not reviewed soba yet?  well, let me remedy this oversight directly.  with this review i have now completed a clean sweep of all big burrito restaurants and i believe have not give one less than four stars.  this is a testament to this talented restaurant group which recently gained national attention by being named a semi-finalist by james beard foundation for restaurater of the year.  that's it pittsburgh we are getting more and more attention with the national food scene.  so, i've been here a million times (well, not literally) and was here last on wednesday for business prior to the pitt game with mike and g. w. (not our former president...he hates asian fusion).  the space is beautiful and i spend most of time at the bar where they serve the full menu.  howeve, a couple tidbits on the dining room.  it's three levels with a bar on the first and third level i believe an also a deck for al fresca' dining.  the first level is beautiful earthy tones, white linens and really comfortable chairs with some bench seating on the sides and four tops scattered about.  the ceilings are very high and there is a staircase in the middle of the room.  the top floor has very nice wood floors and a small wood bar.  the lighting is intimate and flattering.  the bar itself is pretty large with bench seating on the sides and nice comfy leather chairs for lounging.  i believe the doors open up to the sidewalk in the summer.  the service is always adequate, but not necessarily friendly i'd say. i usually get this bald fellow who is nice enough, but probably wouldn't engage in conversation if i was by myself.  one small complaint is that they tend to keep the bar really dark, which i like if i'm trying to hide in the corners while i drink away my concerns, but if i'm on a date i'd prefer a little more light.  the menu seems to me to not change that frequently and i rarely hear them offer features not already on the menu.  i guess it's because i've been here so often, but i wish they had more options.  we started wednesday with korean barbecue ribs, chicken spring rolls and calamari.  the barbecue ribs were probably the best thing i had there all night.  they were well seasoned, fall off the bone and a healthy portion for only $9.  the chicken spring rolls were forgettable and the calamari was just "ok".  it was served lightly breaded, but lacked any real flavor.  we all drank relatively reasonably priced wine for under $10 a glass.  g. w. and i ordered the seared rare tuna, which is a very healthy portion of fresh quick seared good quality tuna with a sesame seed coating.  it's served with house made kim chi (really spicy) and ginger fried rice.  it's a safe choice and probably the most popular entree on the menu.  mike had the seafood hot pot, and i think he was the winner with best entree' choice.  it was a delicious curry broth served with rice on the side overflowing with mussels (fresh), scallops (cooked perfectly) shrimp and i thinki may have even have tasted sausage.  we skipped dessert.  this is a good place for some drinks and even a nice meal, especially if you don't come here often.  congrat's again big burrito group for the james beard nom.

Vthere have only been two superb fusion restaurants that i have been to in the world. there have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. the problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore, the parts do not have to be that good to begin with. unfortunately soba falls in that category.\u000a\u000afor example the corn fritters we had, if you tried the fritters on their own they were barely passable, greasy, falling apart and not much flavor - a virtual fritter failure, however you wrap that mess in the bibb lettuce, put on a basil leaf and dip it in the sauce chili-soy sauce and all of a sudden it becomes a tasty little snack. but i still have to ask would this dish not be better if all the components were excellent? \u000a\u000athe thai corn chowder tasted good, but had a funny mouth appeal, grainy and lumpy at the same time and didn't look appetizing brownish yellow. we eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements.\u000a\u000athe mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor. however the chopped salad was excellent, so all is not dismal at soba.\u000a\u000ai could go on but you get the idea. the place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes. overall most people are not as picky as i am, we tried, it was good with some problems, problems that should not have been there at their price point.\u000a\u000a3.5 stars

Vmy boyfriend took me out to dinner at soba lounge for my birthday last week!  we had reservations for 7 pm on a thursday evening, and had an absolute hell of a time parking!  how does anybody live in this neighborhood?  it's maddening.  the lot next to soba was full, and there's only one way in/out, so it was pretty much impossible to get out of after we realized it was full - don't even bother, just drive around until you find street parking somewhere.\u000a\u000aour disgruntled-ness quickly wore off when we stepped inside.  dimly lit, sleekly decorated, and filled with a sense of zen and calm, my boyfriend noted that it reminded him of the restaurants in chicago.  high praise!  we followed our server upstairs, past a peaceful wall-waterfall, and to our elegant table.  there was a medium-size crowd at soba that night, consisting oddly of mostly older people and businessmen - not many twenty somethings in sight!  that was a bit surprising, but fortunately the noise level was low, giving soba a feeling of intimacy - great for a date!\u000a\u000aour server was friendly, perky, and quick to recommend her favorite dishes.  she was the kind of server who, if you wanted her to, would stop at your table to chat for a few minutes, but if you'd rather she was unobtrusive and quick, she could do that too.  i started with a cocktail, the gin blossom, and my boyfriend got something with drambuie that isn't on the menu anymore.  i loved mine - it was purple!  it was very floral and sweet, perfect for me.  just strong enough too - i sipped it throughout the whole meal.\u000a\u000awe started with the grilled baby octopus, which actually was great!  the texture was meatier than we expected - i think we anticipated the rubbery, chewiness of calamari.  but it was great!  the legs (tentacles?) were lined with grill marks and the meat had a salty, savory taste.  and the aioli that lined the plate?  creamy and delicious.  next, we enjoyed the lobster maki with pistachios and mango - it was delicious and fresh, presented very simply.  a bit pricey for what you get, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.\u000a\u000afor my entree, i had the sea scallops with bbq pork, and it was pretty wonderful.  the scallops were cooked perfectly, and i mean perfectly.  the pork underneath was flavorful and tender - a bit salty, but at least it wasn't bland!  the rice cake noodles were deliciously glutinous and chewy.  it was a good size portion as well - i couldn't quite finish it after the two appetizers we shared, so i had to take a bit home. boyfriend got the pad thai, and i found it a little disappointing in that it was indistinguishable from takeout pad thai.  good takeout, but still - it didn't seem heightened in any way.  which is fine, i guess, but for $19?  whoa.  no.  he was satisfied with it, but i was disappointed since it was a special occasion and his meal definitely wasn't of birthday caliber.  at least it was my birthday and not his!\u000a\u000ai think generally the food here is very good, and the atmosphere is upscale and intimate.  i'd stick with the dishes that are complex and unique.  don't go here and get the pad thai.  but you won't be disappointed by the exotic offerings!

Vi been to soba a few times and i love the food.  the appetizers are particularly wonderful, so this last time i ordered 3 appetizers, then split an entree.  yeah, that works.  the mussels are very flavorful: blue bay mussels, thai sausage, basil, and szechuan peppercorn.  i can also recommend the filet mignon, which is prepared with chili garlic mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, garlic soy,  and pea shoots.  delicious.  i think the service could tighten up a bit, and i wish the hostess would be a little more welcoming, but on the whole, the service was good.

Vdo not go here if you are on a budget and/or really hungry.  however, if you have an expense account or are a guest of someone with an expense account (as i was last night) than this is a good option.  in fact, this is the best sushi i've had in pittsburgh.  umi is a part of the admirable big  burrito group.  it's located above soba.  it's up two long sets of stairs, so if you are bringing someone handicapable or elderly they'll have trouble navigating the double staircases.  as i was walking up the stairs last night i noticed the painted large waves on the walls.  i believe umi is japanese for big wave (maybe?).  our reservation was for 6:30 and initially they only had the tatami tables where you sit on the ground and your feet dangle in a hole in the floor.  these tables are probably okay for date night, but would have been weird with two business associates.  luckily, a table opened up.  if it's this busy on a tuesday i suggest a reservations.  anyways, the rest of the space is very nice with a sushi bar with about 5 seats as soon as you enter and very warm colors with a few scuptures and a waterfall in the middle of the dining room.  the service was pretty good.  there was nothing particularly memorable.  i started with a mark west chardonnay, which was okay and priced under $10.  they also have a good selection of warm and cold sake'.  i started with the white tuna sashimi which was a few slices of super fresh melt in your mouth tuna with a nice soy sauce and just the right amount of wasabi.  matt tried the shrimp tempura which was perfectly breaded quickly fried light shrimp with veggies.  this was a good deal at $12.  keith had the lobster soup which had a few big chunks of lobster and a nice broth.  i ordered the toro tartar with caviar, which was probably a teaspoon of super creamy fatty tuna and a touch of caviar.  this was really rich and one of the most expensive teaspoon serving i've ever had at $21 for such a small amount.  keith had some noodle dish which he said was good and actually was pretty reasonable, but again it's noodles.  matt ordered the strip steak tataki, which was about 1 1/2 ounces of prime steak served with a sweet soy sauce.  it was delicious, but again $20 for less than a 2 oz. serving.  i stuck with sashimi.  the lobster sashimi was great and had some type of flavored sauce instead of just soy.  the salmon and tuna were also amazing.  they were cut perfectly and tasted like they were just pulled from the sea.  overall a really good sashimi "dinner", however i have to admit i did stop for pizza a few hours later.

Va nice quiet atmosphere with good service and excellent food. i've tried many sushi places in pittsburgh, and flavor/presentation wise, this was clearly the winner. the sushi here is so good you want to just let it melt in your mouth and savor each piece. only drawback is the price! highly recommended.

Vthis is a great place to go for a special dinner. i've been here twice, and on both occasions had a wonderful three hour long dinner. the food is delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed feeling, and the waitstaff are friendly. my only complaint about umi is the exorbitant price!

Vumi is alright.  what i mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, i'm never completely satisfied when i leave.  let's start with the good:\u000a\u000athey have great quality sushi.  they have interesting taste combinations.  the decor is fun, especially if you sit in the "traditional" seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).  \u000a\u000abut, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, "great meal, but holy moly.  dunno if it was $xxx good."  we'll continue to come, but probably only if someone else is paying.  in the meantime, it's off to tamari we go.

Vi took my boyfriend to get the omakase dinner at umi as a christmas present - it seems like the best location to go for a special occasion, something really memorable.\u000a\u000awe made a reservation for a saturday evening, and got a little dressed up - with the dim lighting and sleek decor, it's fun to wear something here besides regular ol' jeans.  the host was very friendly, taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious.  umi is a place with truly skilled service, one of the few places i've eaten in town with utterly professional staff.  they are knowledgeable and skillful, and they added tremendously to our dining experience.\u000a\u000athe omakase dinner is pricey, i think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  the eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  alas, time has passed since our meal and i failed to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  i'd say five out of seven.  there were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  one course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - i want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly simple but tasting complex.  we took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious.  \u000a\u000amy boyfriend raved about the meal as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful experience.  i will give it five stars, but i hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  i have no doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh and certainly worth paying for, but the bill for two of us was well over $200 including the sake.  and the food, while excellent, was extremely light and delicate.  now i'm not a big fan of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, i hoped to have a little bit more food.  i was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but i was surprised that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing pieces of fish on a plate.  they were all wonderful - but it was a lot of sashimi.  i was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, perhaps?\u000a\u000abut that doesn't change the fact that every bite of food we did have was of impeccable quality.  i'd recommend omakase only to those who are celebrating a special occasion, love raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  i think in the future, i'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  and umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding service and chefs who are clearly passionate about their product.

Vthe food at this location was about the same as at the squirrel hill location on forbes avenue (not bad, not great), but i thought the service was far worse. one of the male employees helping us referred to one of the females as an "old hag" which i thought was extremely unprofessional and uncool. i'm sure he was joking, but that's still not something he should have said around customers. this tainted the whole experience for me and i probably won't be returning. my dining partner agreed.

Vthis is a nice little tile store in the city, but being small, the selection is somewhat limited and requires flipping through samples which are partially hidden. this place is a bit on the higher end, so i would not go here if you are under a tight budget. customer service was friendly, and the sales people were knowledgeable and professional.

Vi went here last night with a couple of friends befor watchin' the black and gold complete the almost annual boring task of wooping' on some brownie as* in cleveland.  we were seated upstairs at a great table upstairs facing ellseworth.  the view was great watching many of my fellow burghers' imbibe on a windy sunday afternoon.  the positive experience ended here.  well, maybe except for the humorous menu that made me smile.  the waitress was so below average, you know the type... she is doing you a favor by taking your order.  i had the pierogies appetizer which was flavorless potato filling served in a overcooked pasta shell served in vegetable oil with maybe one or two slices of onions.  come on!  this is pittsburgh. you should be ashamed.  then another server brought my burger and i made the unforgivable mistake of asking her to grab me another beer.  sorry, i know you are not the one who took my order, but you are bringing my food.  i've made this mistake before and usually the person says "okay, i'll let your server know", not "ummmm, i'm not serving you,, you'll have to talk to your server".  funny, i thought you might run into each other in the back.  anyways, the burger was close to inedible burnt to a crisp resembled a hockey puck.  we also tried the hummus which was pretty good.  i ordered a kettle one with cranberry and was brought absolut.  friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.  they both said they were pretty good, if not a little dry.  then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our bill.  if they executed the food well and had at least average service i'd be back, however they don't and i won't.

Vthey tell me it's global warming; but, i just don't want to get into a scientific/political debate about this. all i'll say is if global warming means i get these beautiful nights in early november, i don't know what the big deal is. ok, before i get flamed, i'll just continue with my review...\u000a\u000ai was fortunate enough to eat at harris grill on a beautiful night in early november. the temperature was just about perfect for a fall night to eat out on their patio. the outside seating gives a really nice atmosphere to wind down after a long day at work. now i know why people like coming here for happy hour. the inside has a nice lounge area, also good for getting to know your co-workers outside of the office structure. i give it a good solid 4 stars for the restaurant itself.\u000a\u000athe food is okay too. i had the lettuce pray - seared tuna and grilled peppers with lettuce to wrap it all in. i liked it; it was a nice small snack to accompany my beer. i did enjoy the entertaining menu names. the beer selection is not that big, but they have an ok variety to choose from.  for the food, i'll give it 2.5 stars because, although it wasn't bad, it also wasn't anything to remember. \u000a\u000a3 stars for harris grill. i would definitely recommend this place when you just want to go out on a casual fun night with friends. you can grab a drink, order something to nosh on, but you're really there to enjoy the company.

Vexcellent vegetarian options, excellent beer selection, good non-vegetarian options, and an all-you-can-eat bacon night.  the wait staff is awesome, friendly, and knowledgeable.\u000a\u000athe average patron, unfortunately, isn't half as cool as the staff, and i avoid the mixed drinks, as the scotch and soda i had was just bad.  plus, there's an awesome patio, but it's the smoking section, unless that's changed.\u000a\u000asunday brunch is also designed to cure the common hangover, which isn't a bad plan.

Vatmosphere - downstairs was nice and cozy with the fireplace roaring. upstairs was a bit chilly and we were seated in front of a huge window overlooking ellsworth ave which was nice, but i was freezing in front of that window. \u000a\u000aservice was great. our waiter was very helpful and attentive, but not overly so. \u000a\u000afood was good. best greek salad ever, french fries and onion rings frozen and fried, my falafel was almost burnt, would have been delicious if taken out of the frier 3 minutes earlier and jb's italian hoagie got his seal of approval. \u000a\u000athe menu and attitude of the place is witty and fun, we'll be back for sure.

Vi used to be a regular at harris grill until i moved a bit further away, but i still try to return for the i can haz bacon cheesburger and bacon night. where else can you go on a tuesday and order a side of bacon with your meal?\u000a\u000awhile harris isn't the only place in pittsburgh where you can get your drinks delivered to you by a cute hipster waitstaff, it certainly has one of the widest & best beer selections in the city. i've also heard tell that the frozen cosmos are quite good.

Vmight i say that this is one of the best places in pittsburgh to get a late night bite and brew?  yes, i might and will say this.\u000a\u000aafter a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, i decided i needed to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort food and try out a few brews.  this, my friends, is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).\u000a\u000amy friend had beat me there and already had one of each in front of her.  she decided on the trailerpark tatchos and i'm not quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting in an interesting glass.  the tatchos were amazing.  nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant idea none the less.  the mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great.  in a single bite you got spicy, hot and cool.  i decided that i needed to order something else myself, as i feared that my friend might end up raising her lip and snarling at me for eating more than i should.  i got myself an order of cloudy and a chance of these.  i dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.   ding ding ding...you, sir get a prize...not really.  nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed.  the right combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  and that bread made sure i didn't miss a smear of that sauce.\u000a\u000aas for the brews, i tasted three different ones while i was here.  it was kind of hard to choose, but their nifty little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  what also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able to make suggestions, not just guesses like most places.  \u000a\u000adifferent flavors hitting my palate at just the right time made for a great night here.  i will definitely keep this on my short list when i need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.

Vi love hey betty!  it is such a fun place to simply browse!  i warn you though, you could blow your entire paycheck here.  i play bass in a band (unfortunately, we're not as active as we once were) and most of the time i wear, well, whatever.  every so often though, i like to wear vintage clothing that i've bought here!\u000a\u000athe collection here is certainly eclectic enough.  they also have vintage accessories too.    they have retro jeans, but i'm really more into vintage dresses and costume jewelry.  they also have retro tee-shirts (and not the ones you can get at target, either).  my brother once bought a pittsburgh gladiators t-shirt and a pittsburgh pirhanas jersey here.\u000a\u000aso this is the place to be in shadyside when you want vintage.  prepare to empty your wallet here!

Vhey betty is another place i had to hit on thanksgiving weekend.  you know, when the malls and big box stores are full of grade-a morons who will do anything to save a buck on chinese-made crap!  no, places like hey betty and eons are for those who want to relax and have a little fun while shopping.\u000a\u000ahey betty is a little bit small and it does require a bit of poking around in.  but they've got both men's and women's stuff here and i've even found things rick enjoyed.  i've bought vintage levi's and lee jeans here because, let's face it, the old jeans which were made in the usa fit me better and lasted longer.  i've still got a vintage pair i found here three years ago.

Vi have lived in pittsburgh for almost a decade and have never been to this restaurant until now.  many people could not believe it.  but honestly, from the outside, this place did not appeal to me.  it looked like it would be some kind of shabby bar inside.  this is not he case.  inside, it is quite cozy with a nice bar area (very smoky, blah) and another adjacent dining room that is very nice and the non-smoking area.  the host and server were both extremely nice.  the food - well, it was ok.  i couldn't decide what to get and our server recommended the french dip as very good.  well, first,  i should have looked more carefully or asked, because it came on a croissant.  eww.  then, the beef was tough, non juicy, which, i know, is what the au jus is for, but even that can't help tough overcooked meat.  and where were the onions?  all i spied and at was the meat and provolone cheese on top.  the onion rings were good.  \u000a\u000aoverall, this place was ok.  i probably wouldn't come back again if i had my choice.

Vi've been here twice and i'm just not crazy about it.  nothing is bad, per se, just not really impressive.  the service is fine and the food is certainly edible, but missing something - at least, their vegetarian food.  when i ordered sweet potato fries, a lot of them came out burnt.  the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks.  their french onion soup was pretty good, but when is french onion soup not good?  they have a hot vegetarian sandwich, but it sounds gross.  does hot hummus and alfalfa sprouts sound good to you?  as for non-vegetarian food, my dad was very satisfied with his hot grilled chicken salad.\u000a\u000ai wouldn't mind coming back for brunch.  since it's just around the corner from my new apartment, i'm sure i'll end up going here with my parents fairly often.  i'm not crazy about it, but if they're paying, i'm not opposed to it.

Vbeen there twice in the last year.  the service was mediocre once, and embarrassingly bad the second time.  the food is good; it's meatloaf-centric american.  it's a place you'd take your conservative parents.\u000a\u000athat said, the first time i was in, some of the regular customers were being ridiculously outgoing about politics, and decided to group-hate some things i find pretty reasonable.  didn't seem reasonable to argue with a large group of folks in their regular spot, so, ah, that's that.\u000a\u000aif you can't find plain-to-upscale american food in pittsburgh, you're really not looking very hard.  reading another review, i'd be baffled trying to figure out why anyone would take the bus here.

Vi met a group of girls here for dinner last night, and my initial first impressions were very positive.  the space was attractive, with a nice bar area and bottles of wine decoratively placed on display.  some of the wine was reasonably priced, and the wine list included descriptive words below each type, like "dry, food-friendly, hints of pear."  very helpful to a wine ignoramus like me.  there was only one bartender at 730 pm, and he was quite busy so it was difficult to get his attention.  one of my friends also was given a dirty glass with smudges on it at first, but as soon as we managed to signal the busy bartender, he fixed it quickly.\u000a\u000aour server was very friendly and cheerful.  she didn't rush us, and made good wine recommendations.  we had to ask for water, which i thought was a bit weird since the table was pre-set with empty water glasses.  i just assumed someone would be round with a pitcher, but that was not the case.\u000a\u000awe started with the artichoke dip, which was pretty good - your usual creamy dip with artichoke hearts and spinach.  it was served with some little slices of french bread, and was a pretty decent appetizer.  for my entree, i got the danish burger, and here's where things took a major tumble.  the burger supposedly had "herbed caper relish and bleu cheese."  now tell me - how flavorful does that sound?  it sounds pungent, sharp, and just what i was in the mood for.  what i received was one of the most bland burgers i had ever eaten.  seriously.  what.  was.  the deal?\u000a\u000ait was cooked the way i asked, and taking the bun off revealed that there was indeed caper relish and bleu cheese on the burger.  but there was a very small amount of it - when i ate a crumble of cheese by itself it was delicious, but on the burger, the flavor just vanished.  the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef.  i couldn't taste salt, pepper, garlic, anything.  i had to put ketchup on it!  ketchup!  normally that's not weird, but on a burger with bleu cheese and caper relish, i shouldn't need other condiments.\u000a\u000ai lost interest in it very quickly, and focused on eating my sweet potato fries.  i should say that those were pretty tasty, and i was happy to spend my time gobbling them up.  i took most of the burger home, and fed it to my boyfriend, who agreed that it was a super boring burger.\u000a\u000amajor bummer.  i considered giving this place a 3 since it's a cute restaurant, the service was good, we enjoyed our wine, my sweet potato fries were hot and crispy, and the appetizer was all right, but ugh that burger!  i can't with that burger.\u000a\u000athat being said, i'd go back for wine and i'd hesitantly try something from another part of the menu, but i'm done with their burgers.  their burgers are dead to me.\u000a\u000athe hunt for a decent burger in pittsburgh goes on...

Vthree stars, really?  bland?  applebee's like?  i disagree sir...circle gets a square.\u000a\u000ayes, this is a new (old max & erma's) location, never been to the old location.  yes there are still remnants of the old there, no remodel was done, but that does not mean the place does not have character.  something intimate about walking up that staircase, or even taking the small elevator up to the restaurant area.  it feels bright once you get upstairs.\u000a\u000amy recent visit was during lunch in the middle of the week.  i met my friend and didn't even have a chance to greet him and we were being seated.  an instant later we were greeted by our waitress with water for the table.  we were told the soups of the day and off she went to give us some time to look over the menu.  even though we were delaying her a bit by conversating, she was patient with us.\u000a\u000ai ordered the gw, my friend ordered a burger.  the gw is a a nice mixture of roast turkey, melted  brie, and granny smith apple slices (yes, i know it's odd, but it worked (now what's bland about that?)).  all that between two slices of  multi-grain bread with honey mustard and then toasted.  the combination worked so well together that if you didn't actually see the turkey and granny smith apples, you'd think you were eating a high end grilled cheese sandwich.  your choice of side was either hand cut fries or cole slaw, or you could upcharge and get sweet potato fries or onion rings.\u000a\u000amy friend ordered the average joe burger where you can basically build your own burger.  he ordered it medium rare and it came out cooked perfectly good.\u000a\u000atowards the end, and this is the reason i could not give this place five stars, we felt a little rushed to leave.  i could understand if the place was packed and people were waiting outside, but that was not the case.  there was brisk business going on, but that was no need to rush us out.  the check was delivered and we didn't even have time to check it before the waitress came back.  she actually had to be told that we didn't even look at it yet.\u000a\u000ai guarantee that i will come back here.  the food was delicious.

Vtook my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned, when i picked it up i had to wait a really long time which was petty absurd because i was the only one there and they had 3 employees behind the counter but only 1 doing work. the price was reasonable but when my bf put his suit on, he noticed they had written his name in sharpie inside all the pieces - even the back of the tie. even though the markings weren't visible, it was sill irritating. \u000a\u000awe found a really awesome dry cleaner (runners) which was always reasonable, the owner (or manager) was always friendly and remembered your face and name. we did a lot of business here but sadly the greenfield location closed. \u000a\u000afooters has so many locations in pittsburgh in convenient locations but it is definitely worth seeking out some other place.

Vi think i've found a home for haircutting in pittsburgh :)  richard is an excellent, if but eccentric, hair dresser.  he gave me a great cut that i love, my co-workers love and my husband loves.  i also got a pedicure and brow wax here.  the pedicure was nice, though i think too expensive.  i was also reminded why i do not typically get my brows waxed in hair salons.  it's not like she did a bad job, but it just wasn't thorough and kinda painful.  also, this place does lots of coupon-like discounts and deals.  it seemed a little strange for a place that was so busy, but it's only good for me, so hey!

Vi've since had two more haircuts from richard. the second haircut was great, but styled horribly. when i left i literally looked like i was wearing a wig from the early '90's. once i was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, i really loved it. the third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. i just hate it, and i'm not sure what to do about it. i'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!

Voh my!  i keep telling myself "it's okay, susan, you can have this for your snack when your bgs go low."  contrary to popular belief, we diabetics can have a cookie or a piece of cake (indeed we must sometimes), but we have to watch our carbs and take enough insulin to cover.\u000a\u000ahaving said that, where to begin about this place?  how about with their famous burnt almond torte.  these things are so good, they can now ship them anywhere.  they make a "travel" torte version with their  "wedding creme" custard, which doesn't require refrigeration.  sigh, but i usually limit myself to their cookies and their fine bread.  as i said on another review of mine "pump that insulin, susan!"

Vi came in here looking for an italian loaf to serve with dinner at around 2 pm and was rudely informed by the girl at the counter that they were sold out of pretty much anything of the sort.\u000a\u000adisappointed, but being new to pittsburgh, i got a small "bar" version of the famous burnt almond torte.  \u000a\u000aregardless of the bad service, i'll be back for another piece of almond torte...it was that awesome.

Vi'm not really a dessert person, but i was going home to visit and i always like to bring a little bit of pittsburgh home with me so i stopped in for some goodies. i got an assortment of their mini pastries which was perfect because you get to sample a little bit of everything. everyone was impressed. in fact, so impressed that i'm not allowed home without a prantl's box in my hand.\u000a\u000athe burnt almond torte with vanilla icing is simply to die for. i've had it several times and it's always been moist and an explosion of nutty goodness with every bite. let me stop myself... this is starting to sound dirty.\u000a\u000ain addition to wonderful pastries, they also offer a decent selection of breads and rolls which are tasty as well, but i wouldn't go out of my for them.

Vmarvelous bakery.  they are quite famous for their burnt almond torte, and it never disappoints.  i thought i would have to order this ahead, but it seems as if they always have plenty on hand.

Vthis coffee shop is fine -- decently made espresso drinks and i've had no problems with the service. i use this as a backup location when the others in shadyside are too busy. not a huge fan of the atmosphere inside...

Vjitters definitely has good coffee and ice cream, but as others noted, the service can be a little hit or miss.  the ice cream here is hand made without any preservatives.  the baked goods are from prantl's, so they're localy sourced.  in the fall and winter they have a good pumpkin spice latte.\u000a\u000aone thing i noticed:  theyhaven't updated their website in awhile.

Vsorry folks, i'm not a fan.  when out with my family we decided to get something frozen for a treat.  the one good thing about this place is that it serves dave & andy's ice cream.  but that is possibly the only good thing about the place.\u000a\u000athere is no order in here.  especially with three possible ways to enter.  the proper entrance at the front of the building, the side entrance or if and when the doors are open, walk right through the front of the store.  with that, no one seems to know where the line starts, if there is a line at all for service.  what should take just a few minutes to order your item easily turns into a good ten to fifteen minute wait staring down the person that just cut in front of you and several other people.\u000a\u000athe pricing seems a bit high here too.  for two scopes of ice cream the cost was equivalent to going to a frozen yogurt place and getting a cup filled with not only frozen goodness, but mixture items as well.\u000a\u000athe place is nicely set up, but it does feel a bit crowded in here.

Va decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. decent coffee, tasty bagels, and so-so bagel sandwiches. i've tried several of their sandwiches and been disappointed, but i'd still recommend this location overall. try the upstairs seating; it's divine.

Vgoing into this store is like going into a vacuum.  you loose all track of time.  that's not a bad thing.\u000a\u000ai started in the traditional card section and slowly made my to the homemade, more explicit card section.  i didn't even take time to examine all the calendars and knick knacks they had because i was too enthralled with all the cards to choose from.\u000a\u000abetween here and wildcard, i doubt i'll ever step foot back into a hallmark store.  better quality in cards and the staff are excellent.

Vthe nicest full-range grocery i've ever seen.  with, well, a catch.  \u000a\u000ait's the flagship store for the giant eagle chain, and they're strongly competing against the whole foods and trader joe's, both less than a mile away.  they stock a large number of quirky items you normally would only see at specialty stores, and the produce section is amazing.  the employees in the produce section are also amazing, as many of them can spout off a recipe for any particular item they sell, with a story and a smile.\u000a\u000athat said, the traffic in and out of this place is pretty rough, and the prices on random items are much higher than you might expect, while the average price of items are actually pretty darn good.  hummus is ridiculously expensive.  juice is cheap.  dunno.\u000a\u000aevery time we go here, we come out highly stressed, which sucks.  the parking lot, traffic, and lines all make for a bad time, so i shop elsewhere unless i really need something that other places don't stock.

Vdude, the other reviewers were not kidding about the parking.  i'm not a big fan of carrying orange juice up hills in the rain, but i think it would be worth it to not have to attempt to park in that insane asylum known as the giant eagle parking lot.\u000a\u000agiant eagle pita chips lose to trader joe's.  they got groceries though, lots of groceries!  i like being able to buy marketplace hummus dip and toilet paper.  this place might beat out trader joe's for me for regular grocery trips, when i have to buy like, lettuce, and shampoo.

Vif they actually actually kept the store stocked, this would be a 4 star review.  however, i fight the traffic, parking lot, people with baskets, elevator, and rest of the customers to get to the bulk spices, mexican section & produce only to find 100% of the things i need not stocked. so incredibly frustrating!\u000a  they do have a nice cheese section, bakery, prepared food section & juice bar.

Vi was scared to come into this giant eagle since the parking lot looked like a madhouse, but then i found an easy place to park in the garage, hopped in the giant elevator, and walked out the door and into a land of awesomeness.\u000a\u000amy foodie boyfriend and i run into a problem all the time - we use both specialty ingredients like unique meats, cheeses, and produce, asian ingredients, things like that...and we also want tide, bounty paper towels, cheerios, cheap barilla pasta, that kind of thing.  and up until now, i hadn't found a place where you could get both.\u000a\u000ain that sense, this giant eagle market district is the bomb.  the bomb!!!  they had a huge bakery section, a surprisingly unique produce section (thai chiles!  kohlrabi!  purple cauliflower!  taro!  jicama!), a fun gourmet cheese area that carried some very hard to find things (ricotta salata cheese in particular, i remember), a cured meats area where i finally found spanish chorizo after months of hunting, a little olive oil station where you can some pretty decent olive oil in a giant eagle jar for $5.99 and you can taste them first with bread and cheese, a huge italian section, a decent mexican and asian selection, a butcher with some good cuts of meat (who chopped up some lamb shoulder into stew meat for us), a fish market area, some bulk spices at a good price, and lots of other fun delights.\u000a\u000aand they have all the normal, national brands.  how cool is that?\u000a\u000athe normal stuff is as expensive as it is at regular giant eagles, and the fancy stuff is more reminiscent of whole foods prices.  still, there are some good deals.  we still try to do as much of our shopping as possible at trader joe's, but if there's any special thing i need after a tj's run, i might check this place out!

Vsome people go crazy over this location, me, i just go crazy because of this location.\u000a\u000ai hate it, from the congestion in the parking lot to the congestion in every single aisle inside the store.  people are correct that this place has a larger selection of products, but forget your conventional set up for a grocery store.  you would think with this being a market district.  it would be an easy endeavor.\u000a\u000athis location is a place that i would visit for only one thing, definitely not a place i would regularly stop at, unless i lived within walking distance.

Vi much prefer shopping at trader joes, but i like the selection at market district.  they carry some products i don't easily find anywhere else.  parking is tricky, the parking lot is usually crammed and it's hard to find a spot.  prices could be a lot better.  i don't care for their produce, i think they could do a lot to improve their produce.

Vi was like a kid in a ca...err, i mean a toy store.\u000a\u000ai came in here to get some noise makers and ended up browsing the shelves and thinking, "man, to be a kid again."  it takes some time to browse through everything they have.  they've got just about every little trinket and small toy you can imagine.  \u000a\u000ai was just browsing away and picking up just about everything i came across.  examining it, reading the explanations on the package, and of course i played with it, they are toys.  i had completely forgot why i came in here until the lady working the floor brought me back to reality.  once i said i was looking for noise makers, she went into a frenzy much like that of the tasmanian devil and when she stopped, there was a small collection on their best noise makers.  i mean i ended up getting a slide whistle, kazoo, and maraca, just to name a few.\u000a\u000ait's nice to have a store like this around.  it draws you in, tells you to calm down and take a breath, and reminds you that when life gets a bit hectic, sit down on the floor and give that top a spin.

Vdoc's place offers cheap bar food in a chill atmosphere.  the biggest perk doc's has to offer is their price.  there is always a special on something on the menu every single day, from half priced burgers to half priced pizzas.\u000a\u000atheir pizza's are huge, but not particularly tasty.  their burgers are definitely bargains at half price, but nothing spectacular either.  i like my burgers rare / medium rare; the last one i had at doc's seemed to have a darker color than a typical burger, i wasn't sure if it was because the meat was frozen or just not fresh.  i didn't get sick, so there were no issues.\u000a\u000aanyways, doc's place is a nice place to hang out in the spring and fall, as the outdoor balcony is quiet and peaceful, the food just isn't anything noteworthy.

Vthis feels like one of those places that are tucked away and is somewhat of an adventure for you to find. walking walnut in shadyside you usually don't think to walk down the side streets unless you have a purpose for doing so.\u000a\u000ajourneys, not to be confused with the chain shoe store, has a nice mix of items. from gems and incense, to books and art. it took us a while to browse the shelves as there was so much to look over. walking through here as well makes you think that you are walking through someones personal pintrest page in real life.\u000a\u000athe book selection upstairs is a lot of self help, guidance type of reads. good if you have a job where you are there to help people. they also have educational board games that would be good for children (don't read that as boring either).\u000a\u000awhy not five stars?  i'm a bit skeptical of a place that sells items that are to help you cure yourself when it's not medication.  but that shouldn't deter people from coming here.

Vi ate here last night.  there are aspects of the space that i really appreciated such as the stone walls and artwork.  it's very cozy and seems like a nice escape from the hustle of walnut, however it is so freakin' loud.  i usually don't mind the noise in restaurants in fact i don't recall ever commenting on the sound factor, but this place is reallly loud.  i guess there's good and bad with loudness.  the bad is obvious, but the noise and close quarters does paradoxically provide a level of privacy, because the tables are so close together that if it weren't loud your neighbor could here every detail of your conversation.  the service was excellent.  the place was packed not an empty seat in the house.  our waitress was efficient and didn't seem intrusive.  we ordered a bottle of a very reasonably priced white wine.  i think around $45 for the bottle.  it was delicious and paired well with the food.  i was a little surprised that the bread was cold and i think they could be a little bit more creative with the butter or dips that are paired with the bread.  they could take a lesson from jonathan at alla famiglia.  my friend ordered a very delicious looking salad.  she said it was very good.  i'm not much of a salad guy, but i can pretty much tell how the rest of the courses are going to taste after looking at the salad.  this one had many great ingredients outside of your average lettuce, tomato, etc.. i ordered the escarole and beans instead of the salad.  they were quite good.  i really liked the sauce and the greens were delicious.  a little parmigian to top off the dish was perfect.  i ordered the small size and i could have ate it as an entree'.  i had the salmon and risotti for my entree'.  the salmon was cooked perfectly and the risotto was pretty good, but i've certainly had better.  the flavors didn't stand out as much as i would have liked.  my friend ordered a ravioli with cream sauce and peas.  she said it was delicious and i sampled and concurred.  the pasta was cooked perfectly.  this is a good spot.  i'd give it 3.5 stars if i could instead of 3.

Vexcellent italian food.  very cozy - not a place where you want to have a business dinner, but go if you have some close friends and you don't mind yelling over the table.  the food is fantastic - any of their raviolis will do.  service is attentive, and their pastas come with soup or a hefty salad.  reasonable prices, given the quality.

Vgirasole is a small italian restaurant off walnut street that serves up decent italian food.  i've only been to girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  most patrons appear to be late 20's/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  the restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  i'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  anyways, on with the food.\u000a\u000atheir menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 pm).  all entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  i ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.\u000a\u000awhile we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.\u000a\u000athe wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  i picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and i don't like my salads soggy.\u000a\u000athe ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  it was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks i'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  the pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  the steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.\u000a\u000ai've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and i don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.\u000a\u000ai would probably recommend lydia's over girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.

Voh how i wanted to like this place, i love little restaurants like this, the rustic stone walls, the small tables, etc, they do have one drawback, when busy, they can get loud and this place gets very loud.\u000a\u000aservice - aloof, unknowledgeable, friendly, but overall you would probably get more professional service at your local ihop than we did. i asked for a pronunciation on the menu, they didn't know, i asked about a product, said they were unsure what it was, and then we had to ask for the bill from a busboy after waiting and waiting for a long time. 2 stars\u000a\u000avalue - no, sorry this place is expensive and the food does not match the price. we split an appetizer, had two entrees and one ice tea bill was $64 and one of the entrees was simple polenta. 2 stars\u000a\u000afood - don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but when you pay $30 for an entre you expect a really well prepared and executed entre. in this case i had traditional osso bucco, the shank was excellent, the marrow delicious, the risotto milanese over-cooked and sub par. the polenta entre was good, but the polenta was actually very plain tasting and covered with a slice of mozzarella cheese. salads were horrendously over-dressed and our appetizer was $13 for one sausage link and a pear and taleggio crepe, it was good, probably the best dish of the meal, but i had to marvel at the cost. 3.5 stars\u000a\u000abottom line: 2.5 stars.

Vafter months and months on hiatus i have made a resolution that i think i'll actually be able to keep (unlike the nye 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  it started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was girasole last night.  however, i feel the need to document the experience immediately.  if only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  the lady and i wanted to try somewhere newish and i hadn't been here in over a year when i was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  i'm sure much of what i said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  i call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what i seem to remember always being a wait...we arrived at 8pm sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who i assume is the owner.   we mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...great!  i understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...okay, i'll try to make this easy.."sir, may i please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?"..."sure, what is it?".  we go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...now, keep in mind i booked a reservation well in advance.  we go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  okay, i know what you're thinking why not just leave?  i've already admitted it's nothing special.  i know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  so, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through annie and i and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  i have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  it was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  i can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  there is a happy ending...we ended up at the bar at eleven, i had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  we won't be back to girasole.

Vwhat is there to say about girasole? an italian owner who wanders around the restaurant (often with a glass of wine) greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff; a friendly staff; and fantastic food. seriously, the food is great. order anything on the menu & you won't be disappointed.\u000a\u000athe best part about girasole, though, is the intimate indoor & outdoor atmosphere & the wine. pours are generous, and there's a fantastic selection to choose from. if you're having difficulty, your server will be happy to help you, too (ask for ryan). did i mention the wine? seriously, the pours are generous, and if you must bring your own, bring a lot, because the corking fee is very reasonable.

Vi've been meaning to try girasole for at least three years. finally got around to it tonight as we were looking for a nice patio dining experience on what is presumably one of the last warm autumn evenings of the year. the patio is somewhat tight, but pleasant -- we were able to get seated within a few minutes. it's on a side street to walnut, so it's quiet and appears to be non-smoking which is a huge plus.\u000a\u000athe entres (pumpkin ravioli and grilled chicken with gnocchi) were delicious, as were the appetizer salads. they have a decent italian wine menu, and a selection of mixed drinks too. overall, we had a good experience, although the servers seemed rushed and this made the experience somewhat less pleasant.

Vthis is a a good interesting spot.  it's located on walnut above pamelas.  i don't recall ever having peruvian food before, but will definitely try again.  it's a small place where everyone seems to know each other.  the specials change weekly and are a good deal for $10.  the service is friendly and the portions are appropriate.  we started yesterday with sweet patatoe chips (i think) with some type of dip.  it was very good and a nice change for a first course.  i  had the chicken and rice cooked in cilantro which was really good.  the cilantro really gave the dish a crisp fresh flavor.  the limeade was delicious and gave me an appropriate mid afternoon sugar buzz.  it's a good discovery and a unique place to take your out of town guests.

Vexcellent food, especially given the price.  i can't tell how they stay in business, because i've only ever been in there with one or two other parties.  but the food is really good, and the service is friendly and informal.  come to get away from the crowds on walnut, and be surprised by the quality of the food.  all entrees come with salad and rice.  my personal favorite is the cream chicken entree - deelish!

Vi really don't know where to start.\u000a\u000ai went to la feria for lunch today, my companion and i did not utter one word while there was food on the table.\u000a\u000awe both started with "inca cola", a peruvian "cream soda".  i'm not usually a soda drinker, but i felt like i should try something new.  it was unique, but a bit too sweet for my palate which isn't accustomed to drinking soda anymore.\u000a\u000awe also split a sampler of their empanadas, which were amazing.  perfect ratio of pastry to filling.  perfectly seasoned fillings, perfectly cooked exterior that undercooked nor burnt.\u000a\u000afor entrees, we both decided to get the "pollo borracho", breast of chicken baked with fresh tomatoes, olives, capers, and white wine (from their website).  it came with a side of salad, rice, and french bread.  my companion paused after his first mouthful to say "oh my god.  this chicken is amazing."  we didn't speak again until both our plates were completely empty.  the salad, rice, and french bread were what were expected, but the chicken.  wow.  i don't know how exactly they bake it, but the chicken breast was even more tender and moist than most of the chicken thighs i've eaten.  not dry, not stringy by any means.  completely exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aprices were definitely reasonable, w/ the daily entrees topping out the menu at $10.50.\u000a\u000ai also like the homey feeling i get while in there.  there were around five other parties, which i think is pretty good since it was before noon on a saturday and pamela's is right next door.\u000a\u000ahighly highly recommended, i'll most definitely be back.  for sure.

Vnearly empty on a friday evening around 8:00.  service was fast and extremely friendly.  the menu is a decent size, with specials posted on a board above the counter.  i got a pumpkin/rice souffle with cheese and peas for $10.50, and it came with salad, rice, and french bread.  however, the salad took up about half the plate, and the rice took up a quarter, which meant that you only end up getting a small portion of the actual entree - disappointing, since it was delicious.  i also had a lemonade, which was not overly tart or overly sweet.\u000a\u000athis is a good place to go for a casual meal.  you can definitely go in wearing jeans.  i hope to come back and try more of their specials.

Vi came here on a friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents, who were staying at a nearby b and b.  we wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive, and la feria definitely is both of those things.  we almost didn't find it - it's upstairs above pamela's.  pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out la feria. \u000a\u000athere was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  there are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  we all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  the drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.\u000a\u000ai ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  it came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of french bread.  the chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  i really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and i looooove cheese.  the bread was pretty standard, so i used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  nom!  my boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which i tasted.  not as much meat as i'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!\u000a\u000afor dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  everyone really enjoyed their meal.  it just feels like a good place to spend your money.  it's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  i think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.  i really want to taste those empanadas....

Vsomething told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.  i was pleasantly surprised when i stumbled upon here.  i saw pamela's and thought oh well, if i can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  when i walked in i saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.  \u000a\u000ai can honestly say i have no clue as to what peruvian food is and even though i partook in this delicious place i still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  we were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  for lunch this place was not busy in the least.  too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  i skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  i cannot remember the name of what i ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after i finished my plate, short of licking it clean, i wanted more of the special!  the special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  what an ideal combination of flavors.  the special also came with rice i believe and the house salad.  the salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  the dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.\u000a\u000aour server seemed a little inexperienced, but i won't hold that against her.  i am going to assume that she didn't know much about peruvian food either.  even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.  \u000a\u000athey also have shelves of peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  i did not while i was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal.

Vwonderful food in a relaxed environment.  the staff is always very friendly and attentive.  the menu always features great vegetarian options.  if you don't know which dish to pick there is a delicious combination plate that i like to order.  the menu has a lot of variety and everything appears to be made fresh. la feria is a gem!

Vthis is the place to be late-night...  you can get some good pizza, watch the drunken antics around you and possibly be the star attraction if you are that drunk person.  they cook your pizza pretty quickly and it has always been good.  tip:  call ahead as you are walking over and your pizza will be done that much more quickly!\u000a\u000ap.s.  this place is 3 stars for food, but gets upgraded to 4 stars for the stories i have to tell because of the antics witnessed here!

Vpancakes!  what can i say, but pancakes, pancakes, and more pancakes!  because i'm a type-1 diabetic, i have to plan before and after if i eat a meal here!  pump that insulin, susan, pump!  i have to watch the carbs when i eat here.  but pamela's has the best pancakes in pittsburgh!  \u000a\u000abut if for some reason my bgs are acting wacky--and believe me, they do--there are plenty of other dishes to order here.  i like their eggs, including plain ol' scrambled eggs and fried eggs.  the coffee here is decent, but if you order during off-hours, it can be a little burnt.  yes, the wait times here are legendary, but if ya want eggs or cakes, this place is it!

Vsome of the best breakfast you'll find.  the crepe pancakes are unique and good.  everything comes in large-but-reasonable portions, and everything is reasonably priced.  the service is fast and friendly.  the line is understandably long at times.\u000a\u000athe secret to the crepe pancakes, and the potatoes, is a *lot* of butter and/or oil.  they aren't really very healthy choices.  pamela's only has mixed fruit jelly for some reason, as something tasty doesn't fit the budget?  \u000a\u000athat said, you don't order fried potatoes and pancakes as health foods, and one can forgive them the mixed fruit.  5 stars, because you're not going to find a better breakfast-only place.

Vwow i couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when i had brunch, to 9pm!  usually i hate homefries, but these were great!  i think i can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding.

Vthey are unique to pittsburgh and the crepes are outstanding.  the owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who i was with this morning who frequent much more than i do.  the place was packed at 2 pm on a saturday i can't imagine it being comfortable on a sunday or saturday am.  the wait staff in general is off and i'm really not sure why.  i mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise "bohemian" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic frecnch experience.  you do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best i've ever had in pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  i had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  it had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  a friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  this was also a smashing success.  i think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but i'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already.

V*for the bar\u000a\u000awhile looking for places to have easter brunch, i saw the sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. they no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. i should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but i threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a friday evening.\u000a\u000ajust getting off work, i came alone. the location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. the mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. the furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. the bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. the top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\u000a\u000ai browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that jose cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). i stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \u000a\u000ait was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. banker's club is the gin of choice here, and burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. the martini came(not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\u000a\u000ai found as i drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. i quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. how much did my room temperature banker's club cost? a cool $9.\u000a\u000ait appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. if you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to walnut street. at least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.

Vwent here after dinner to grab a frosty but gave up after an extended wait. the cashiers were busy chatting with their friends and couldn't be bothered to help anyone in line. the location also seemed a bit sketchy; i'd avoid this one. try panera bread across the street.

Vin a pinch, wendy's can do.  however, if you're in a hurry, and expect to use the drive-thru and get out, go elsewhere.  that is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto baum blvd.\u000a\u000aquick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.  it's like that long ride on the turnpike when you already passed the last rest stop for 50 miles.

Vyumm-eeee!  i don't care if the previous reviewer thinks that this place is americanized chinese food--i love it!    as i've said on other reviews, i like my food kind of plain, so i love the sesame chicken or the chicken broccoli.  i figure that if a place can get the basics right, then they can do the more complicated dishes.  my husband rick likes his food a little spicier.  his favorite is the kung pao shrimp.  once when i was feeling bold, rick and i split an order of crispy whole fish with homemade spicy hunan sauce.  spicy?  i think i saw through time after trying it!\u000a\u000aone dish i'm going to try someday is three's company.  no, it does not feature joyce dewitt, john ritter, or suzanne summers.  it is  lemon chicken, general tso's chicken and chicken with vegetables.  for the vegetarian-inclined, they have soy protein with cashew nuts, soy protein with curry sauce, and wheat gluten with garlic sauce.  uh, no thanks!  i'll stick to my chicken dishes!  \u000a\u000achina palace features a full bar, but since i'm a diabetic, i usually stick to my tea.  plus my drink of choice (bailey's with coffee) probably would not go well with chinese food!  on the whole, china palace is a place for wonderful chinese food and definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.\u000a\u000anow should i try one of their other specialties, three afire?

Vthis was my first chinese food experience here in pitt, and i've gotta say, guys, i wasn't impressed.  this was also the first time in my life i've ordered from a chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  odd.  i suppose, then, i shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage.  the pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  to end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find.

Vchina palace offers both americanized chinese food and more authentic style dishes.  a good portion of their menu is populated by items such as general tso's chicken and moo shu chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as szechuan water boiled beef (shui zhu nio) and yu xiang eggplant.  personally i have to say the water boiled beef is both the best water boiled beef i've had in pittsburgh and also the best dish i've had at china palace, i like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  their americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.\u000a\u000acontrary to popular belief, china palace actually has a taiwanese owner and not an american owner.\u000a\u000achina palace is nice as you can go there with people with more americanized palates if you have a more asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.\u000a\u000aprices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended.

Vmy husband and i ate lunch here--actually, it was our first meal in our new home of pittsburgh.\u000a\u000ai really expected it to be better than it was.  it was cheap, fast, and the service was good but the food just didn't wow me.  there was nothing wrong with it, but it was just middle-of-the-road americanized chinese lunch special.  (which i suppose i can't complain about, since i knew that when i ordered it.)\u000a\u000athat being said, this chinese place has an amazing vegetarian selection!  i'm not just saying that because i moved from omaha, beef capital of the universe.  i ordered general tso's tofu for lunch--and i could have ordered general tso's soy protein!  ha!\u000a\u000ai would come back here, maybe, if i was looking for a quick bite in shadyside.  but for now i think i'll stick to trying other chinese places in the 'burgh.

Vi liked it.  huge portions, not too expensive, and it's really nice inside.  i like my cheesy general tsos, what can i say.  it's not cuisine, but if you want a big fat plate of sweet and sour pork in a relaxed ambience it's great.\u000a\u000ai'm psyched that they deliver.

Vmmmmmm, great chinese food here!   my dad and i came here for dinner last night after finding out that jimmy tsangs had closed.  rick had to teach a night class and mom had a meeting to go to.  besides, i hadn't been here since my last review.  yeah, i know the chow here is americanized chinese food.  who cares--it's great stuff!  \u000a\u000anow when eating chinese, you should never begin by diving in to your main course right away.  first you've gotta have some soup and some egg rolls!  dad and i both began with some r-e-a-l-l-y good hot-n-sour soup.  man, that was good-n-bold.  warmed my insides right away!  now i know that vegetable spring rolls are supposedly better for you.  yeah right--what's a great chinese dinner without some good old fashioned egg rolls?  i like to put a spoonful each of sweet-n-sour sauce, duck sauce, and hot chinese mustard on my plate, dipping my egg roll in a different one with each bite!  \u000a\u000ai love the names of some of their specialties here, including the triple crown, three afire, sizzling trio, and the royal match.  feeling a little adventurous--and why not:  the old man was paying--i went for the jaded affair.  yum, scallops and shrimp marinated in white sauce.  usually seafood isn't my first choice.  my dad went for the kung pao chicken.  i've got to give him credit--how a guy his age can eat that and not reach for the mylanta is beyond me!

Vok, this place must keep people coming by the ridiculous food portions that they have, because the food itself is not so great.  it's just...  ok.  nothing special.  some of it is not good or undercooked, such as a fellow diner's raw swordfish or mahi mahi that seemed more like tilapia.  wine list just ok and very overpriced.  dessert - way too big of portions (the brownie dessert was enough to feed at least 4-5 people and more, the brownie was undercooked).  there is better food on walnut, i swear.  and even if there isn't, go somewhere else.  service is good which brings this back to a 3-star review.

Vi really enjoyed myself here, but you know what, that was 100% because of the awesome, drunk conversation, all we had was draft beers.  we had 4 for 14$, that doesn't seem too expensive to me.  it was also happy hour when i went there:  half price appetizers (which i didn't eat any of, but were still very exciting).  i have no comments on service, food. or cocktails, and somehow i still really liked it in there!  the bathrooms were clean.  actually when i went to the bathroom i thought "these bathrooms are clean!"

Vduring the three or four times i've been here, i've had friendly service, some decent drinks, and mixed luck with the food. on my last visit, i tried the fish tacos and was sorely disappointed-the tortillas appeared to have been recently revived from the freezer, and the quality of the fish seemed subpar. still, this is pittsburgh, so i don't really expect to get decent fish tacos here but like to try occasionally on the off chance that i will succeed. another failure in my opinion: the fish tacos came with french fries. who serves fish tacos with french fries?! maybe if the fries had actually been decent i wouldn't have minded so much, but they were overly salty and soggy.\u000a\u000ai've had better luck here with the salads and would recommend those.

Vgood if not great place to get a meal at.  mom and i were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the phipps. \u000a\u000athe chicken 'n waffles (organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles) caught my eye as did the eggs benedict.  but i was in the mood for some sweetness.  the  cinnamon swirl french toast with sausage links was pretty good.  mmmm, french toast!  pump that insulin, susan.  pump!  whoo-hoo!  the cinnamon did give it a nice bite too.  good thing rick and i hit the bike trails the day beore.  mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata, which looked good too.\u000a\u000amany of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices.  the dinner prices look high for what you get, but the brunch prices run about $8.00-$10.00 per entree.  service here is good though.

Vcame here with a whole bunch of girls on a wednesday night due to their half-priced wine situation.  actually, we meant to go to shady grove but it was packed, so upstairs we trekked to walnut grill.\u000a\u000ait's dim up there, and has a more formal vibe than shady grove.  the half-priced wine was pretty good, we tried several of the bottles and they were all perfectly decent.  i loved their spinach and artichoke dip, scraping the bottom of the ramekin as best i could to get all the tasty bits.  our server, who was very friendly and cheerful despite having to deal with such a huge group, recommended the california pretzel club.  i have to say, it was pretty good.  dense, and filling, but i enjoyed it.  the avocado spread was a nice touch.  i couldn't finish it, though i made a good effort on the fries, but my boyfriend polished it off later. \u000a\u000aas the evening progressed, they turned the music up - way up - i'd say by 9 pm we had to shout to hear each other.  that wasn't very cool - it's wednesday and you're serving dinner.  people are here to have conversation, it's not a dance club.  sorry, but i'm old and crochety (at age 26) and i like to hear what my dinner companions are saying.\u000a\u000athe entrees looked pricey, but apps and sandwiches are reasonable.  i'd come back for more half-priced wine and a snack sometime.

Vnot impressed, but it is what it is.  much like the other two stores in the plaza that offer much of the same savings.  i always find it weird that they have a tj maxx in here as well, especially since they are owned by the same company.  they should have saved that other store front for another business that would have been a bit different.\u000a\u000athe merchandise is about the same as any other location (read that as: browse, browse a lot).  finding a particular item in here is not an easy task.  but it can be done.  you just have to give it time and keep an open mind.  sometimes this location can be a mess with customers opening packages to see what exactly they are about to buy and that can be an annoyance.  one thing that i do like is they have a fitting room, so even though those jeans are cheap, you can still try them on to make sure they fit before you get them home.\u000a\u000asaving a few bucks never hurt, but you may not always find what you want or need here.

Vgreat place for cheap designer names. \u000a\u000amarshall's is the type of store you go to on a rainy day and sift through the racks for hours. i have found all types of deals at this location. everything from true religion jeans for $99.99 to polo shirts for $29.99. be sure to check out the shoe section for spectacular deals as well.\u000a\u000athis location used to be a hidden gem a couple years ago but, since the economy tanked marshall's is seeing a lot more customers so the selection is not as good as it once was. it seems like now as soon as something is put out it is snatched right up.\u000a\u000abe sure to check the packaging before you buy as a lot of times previous customers will open them up to see what all is inside and then not buy it and leave it there like that.\u000a \u000aif you can't find anything check out the near by tj maxx as both stores are owned by the same company.

Vthere were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and i was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  walked out and got faster service at panera, which had a line out the door.\u000a\u000aoh well.

Vthis was a nice surprise.  i really like sushi, but i don't like having to always drive into the city for decent sushi.  i recently discovered this place just a couple of miles from my house located in the suburbs.  i've tried it twice now.  the first time i was a little nervous about trying the sushi... again, due to its location.  fox chapel is better known for starbucks rather than good ethnic food.  i had the curried chicken and the steamed dumplings.  these were both of good quality.  i thought the curry with the chicken lacked a little flavor, but i'm from the caribbean and used to west indian curry.  the dumplings were nice because they actually were light and not too heavy like they usually are.  i think probably the best chinese in town is the sesame inn with a few locations, but this place is fine.  what i am really impressed with is the sushi.  i had lunch there today and was impressed with the servie and the chef.  the service was really good... maybe a little too much attention, but better that than the alternative.  the chef seemed to be a trained sushi chef.  i'm guessing he learned his trade in asia.  i had some excellent quality white tuna, which was delicious.  i also had the spicy scallop with avocado sushi.  it was really nice with great texture with the creaminess of the avocado and sushi and the crunchiness of something else (not sure  what).  i also had the crabmeat sushi, which was pretty good quality.  the rice had good flavor and the right amount of stickiness.  the sushi was wrapped perfectly.  the chef was helpful and very nice.  i would have preferred authentic wasabi instead of the pasty type stuff you get everywhere, but again that's pretty standard.  i didn't try any of the rolls.  i don't typically eat rolls, because they usually are pretty heavy and one of the reasons i eat sushi is to offset my typical gluttony.  however, the selection seemed really good and i was told by another customer at the sushi bar that the tai pei 101 roll was great.  it should be with a $24 pricetag for a roll.  the ingredients are 7 oz. of lobster, eel, asparagus, onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad.  if this place were in the city i would probably just give it 3 stars, but the fact that it's in the burb's and has this good quality justifies the 4 stars.  and, they deliver!

Vi'll be honest, i'm a cheap bastard.  only reason i took the pup here was because he was due for shots and i had a coupon for the free doctor visit fee.  when i called to set up an appointment for my little man i had asked about pricing and payment.  the price i was quoted was much lower than what i actually got charged while there.  payment is due when you check out.  \u000a\u000ayou can tell the vets and techs are animal lovers, receptionists not so much.  the receptionists were more interested in the stool sample i had than the three month old puppy having a hyper fit.  \u000a\u000aif it is your first time visiting they do give you a nice little starter kit for your animal.  but that was not of a saving grace for me to return.

Vmeh, pier 1 i can love or hate you, depending on the season (or should i say how you rush the seasons).  it delights me when you are in the summer/push to fall season and you have all the different colors in the store.  but i have to say that i am totally not into you when you start putting out candle holders that are to resemble reindeer.  i try to stay clear of your store when this happens.\u000a\u000ait's like a higher end tchotchke store.  sure you could find something of your interest in there, but definitely not an essential that you'll need.

Vgood prices, better coffee.  the food never looks good so i haven't tried it.\u000a\u000ai sometimes stop here for coffee before work, the baristas are always friendly--even at 6:02 am, right after opening. if you're in the area i recommend it over the starbuckses (what is the plural of that?!) in giant eagle or b&n in the waterworks mall.

Vmy girlfriends and i (the girl posse) were looking for something to do on a saturday night.  being that we're all married 30-something(some with kids) music fans, we don't always get a chance to get together and head out to a show.  but somehow the planets were aligned and the whole bunch went out to moondog's for some great live music.\u000a\u000athis is another one of those places in which i can't believe i'm the first to review.  moondog's is a local institution, people!  it's been around here ever since i can remember.  rusted root played here in their pre-"send me on my way" days.\u000a\u000ait's everything you want in a small music venue.  although does mean a slightly cramped seating area and the requisite long lines for the restrooms, it's a great intimate venue to see live music.  and moondog's brings in the music!  it has everything from rock to blues to folk music.  the starlite lounge restaurant is next door and you can order food from there and bring it into the club.  \u000a\u000ait's local music folks.  come out and support it!

Vi really didn't get much of a chance to see this airport as i was just connecting through.  the short version is i was flying back from kansas city to pittsburgh, so what better place to have me connect in than charlottle!  a little outta the way, ya think?  \u000a\u000ai'd booked on united airlines, but both returning segments were on a us airways code-shared flight.  so thank you very much united and us airways for that creative routing!  and of course my connection was at dinnertime!  \u000a\u000amercifully, both flight segments were in and out of concourse d.  so i guess the three stars are for the slice of freschetta pizza i bought at their stand.

Vi was very, very pleased with tatman's.  they towed my car.  they fixed my car.  they didn't send me the same form 4 times to get my insurance info like carle did, they just called the number i gave them and got the info they needed.  i never had to pay them any money because they were so on top of the insurance, even though my repairs were of the substantial variety engendered by being run into by a guy going 30 mph.\u000a\u000athey told me the repairs would take 3 weeks, and they only took 10 days.  there was a small problem with the remote control locking when i came to pick the car up, and even though it was after 5 they fixed it, for free, right then, and gave the car a thorough inspection before letting me leave to make sure nothing else was wrong, and i was still gone 15 minutes after i came to pick the car up.  \u000a\u000aever single person i talked to throughout the entire experience, from the guy that towed the car to the receptionists to the guy that inspected the car after the remote problem was nice and helpful.  i would definitely recommend tatman's to anyone who needs body work done after a car accident.

Vyou know, i actually like rock's.  especially in the summer when it's not too crowded and the outdoor seating is available.  it's a bar, it's clean, and it probably has the best nachos in cu (last night i ate two portions, which is embarrassing because thy are huge!)

Vthis erc gets the majority of my coffee buying business these days, because it has one thing that starbucks, the larger erc in urbana, and the cleaner erc at the crossroads don't have, namely proximity to the psychology building (where i spend my lengthy days of graduate toil).\u000a\u000ait also has a chick with totally awesome hair and espresso bar skills who works mornings.  \u000a\u000alow marks for bathroom cleanliness though.  and don't even try at 5 past any hour on a school day; you might as well buy your own coffee plantation, spend a couple summers refining your picking and roasting strategy, import your beans back to the us, build an espresso machine from paperclips, and make your own latte.

Vthis silver mine has 2 strikes against it that apply before even entering the building:  it's on the same strip of vomit streaked pavement as kam's and c.o.'s, and one of its other neighbors on the same strip is a subway.\u000a\u000aso why do i go there every time i have to buy lunch on campus?  well, there are no scary cross-eyed employees there talking on their cell phones instead of making sandwiches (as at subway.)  instead there is a totally friendly crew of regular sub-makers, as well as a delicious and satisfying selection of subs.  yum!

Vwhen i was a senior, i believed wholeheartedly that brothers was the most ridiculously awesome bar in campustown.  i still believe this, even though i seriously have no idea why.  i love it because it caters to the older students - i never even used to go when i was under 21, because they'd just snatch the beer right out of your hand (jerks).  the music was always the best - a great combination of whatever was popular on the radio at the time, and all those hilarious 80s/90s songs that you never thought you'd hear again.  there was no dance floor - the whole floor could be a dance floor if you staked out your claim early enough.  you could creepily watch people from the top floor; it was a great place to spy on your ex, or that random hookup from freshman year.  i've munched on their mozzarella sticks, failed miserably at their pool tables, and closed out the bar more times than i could ever count - especially senior year.  always will have a place in my heart!

Vthey have a good selection, but wow is this stuff expensive.  it pains me to buy $45 sweatshirts, but i guess that's not uncommon for college attire shops.  they were open until 9 pm on a friday night (homecoming weekend) which was much appreciated, since i needed a long sleeved illini shirt to wear under my hoodie.  we were going to start tailgating around 7 am, and it was about 40 degrees outside.  i needed another warm layer of illini-awesomeness to shield me from the cold until the beer kicked in.  done and done.  they have fitting rooms, which is good.  not much else to say!

Vmandarin wok has been hit or miss for me, mostly depending on whether i go with a person who can read and order from the real menu or whether i have to order myself from the english menu.  it's in campustown, so i usually never go there unless it's for a departmental luncheon, and then i don't have to pay.  in fact, i've never gone to man wok one time when i had to spend my own money.  i think it is more "authentic" than any of the other chinese restaurants i have eaten at in champaign.  but they still serve orange chicken.  \u000a\u000atonight when i was there, i noticed that they have a plasma screen tv in the party room now.  it was playing a chinese game show.  of some sort.

Vtoday was my first visit to the new luna, and i was disappointed-- both because i really liked the old cafe luna, and because the new luna came well recommended.  \u000a\u000athe decor in there is great:  very mod soothing old train station become chic tapas bar.  my initial visual assessment was highly optimistic.\u000a\u000awe were seated quickly, but when we got to the table there were only 2 menus for 8 people.  the waitress apologized that they were "short on menus."  i don't really understand that, because their menus are printed on paper and the dining area was half full, if that.  but, ok, they were short on menus.  (they also gave us mismatching water glasses.  i care zero about matching water glasses, except in a place that is trying soooooooooooooo hard to be all chic-chic.)\u000a\u000athe menu shortage (??) probably wouldn't have been so bad (even when accompanied by the mismatched water glasses), but for the fact that they appeared to also be out of almost everything else.  out of tuna.  out of mussels.  out of quiche of the day, risotto of the day, and quiche lorraine.  by noon on monday!  the feeling we had by the time our food showed up was that we basically had the picked over remnant dishes that no one else wanted. \u000a\u000athat impression was reinforced by the fact that my salmon chowder was definitely the worst soup i have ever been served in a restaurant.  in addition to not really having enough cream to really properly even be called a chowder, the salmon was off.  i would bet the price of the meal that that salmon was saturday (or friday, or thursday) special leftovers.  yuck.  oily salmon leftovers.  neither i nor the other diner in our party who ordered it ate more than 2 bites.  \u000a\u000aone of the diners in our party saw that i wasn't eating my soup and offered me a taste of hers.  hers was only marginally better!  a tomato puree that had cinammon in it, for some reason.\u000a\u000aone of our 8 orders came out wrong.  \u000a\u000aetc.  etc.    \u000a\u000athe waitress didn't charge us for the soup.  so, that was nice of her.  and she was really very nice and properly embarassed that they were out of everything and screwed up our order and gave us gross soup.  so pretty much one star is for the ambience and one star is for the nice waitress.

Vthis olive garden is more crowded and a little dirtier than other olive garden's i've been to in the past.  \u000a\u000alast time i was there, our waiter dropped half of my friend's meal on the floor right in front of her, put some of it back on her plate, and then didn't replace the rest.  this time, we had a really nice friendly waitress.  so i guess it's about what you'd expect from a chain; sometimes the service is good, sometimes it's not.

Vye old time meat and deli shoppe is one of the only places in champaign that i have no reservations about giving 5 stars.  it is spotlessly clean inside, and full of tip top meats!  the staff have always been nice and helpful when i've been there, and i'm pretty sure it's the only place in cu that has rack of lamb.

Vyou guys, if you have to move from champaign, go with allied.  look:  i called 3 moving companies for my move to pa.  mayflower never called me back.  the north american agent made me cry on the phone with such bitchy gems as "i live in new york.  you think i'm going to come to illinois to see your apartment?" after the person who put me on the phone with her told me i was required to schedule an in home estimate with her specifically before my move could proceed.  then i called allied.  they called me back right away, and i was doing my in home estimate the next morning.  i got my moving agreement signed in about 10 minutes and didn't have to think about it again until the movers came.  \u000a\u000anotice:  allied has the contract for moving university personnel in champaign, so if you are university affiliated you get a sixty three percent discount on your move.  amazing.  \u000a\u000athey showed up within half an hour of when they said they would for delivery, and the delivery guys were great.  they kept calling each other "sir," that cracked me up.  go with allied!

Vthis friday's has been recently remodelled, so it's nice and clean and new-looking even though it's been around for awhile.  the remodelling job itself screams trying to hard, but that's probably friday's corporate's fault.\u000a\u000athey will serve you your pecan crusted sicilian teriyaki quesadillas with green bean fries and cheesecake in a reasonable amount of time, and without any of the way, way, way over the top smarm that you might expect from a friday's waitstaff.  and you don't have to drive all the way up to north prospect.\u000a\u000athree stars is probably the maximum i am able to give to any friday's, anywhere, just out of principle, so this awarding of three stars should really say to you "best possible friday's."

Vmy experience with amtrak was surprisingly pleasant.  my morning train in to chicago was sterile-ly clean and almost empty, but took 4 hours (scheduled for 2.75).  my evening train smelled like extreme bo, but only took 2 hours (scheduled again for 2.75).   this state of affairs can be described as "surprisingly pleasant" as i expected both legs of the trip to take 4 hours and smell like extreme bo. \u000a\u000adespite my friends' urgent warnings, no indigent peoples tried to talk to me or make friends on either train.  i think i will use the amtrak again!  way less stressful than driving in the city, and not any more expensive with gas in chicago being up to $4 a gallon.

Vthe minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation.  but only on weeknights.  when there are no sporting events.  and your car has run out of gas and can't get you out of campustown.  and you really need a drink because your advisor just called you to tell you you have to cancel your weekend plans to come over and shovel his sidewalk.  \u000a\u000athe leftover vomit is less tangible, the smoky haze less all-engulfing, and the number of 14 year olds skanks less overwhelming than anywhere else on campus (except firehaus, but apparently no one goes to firehaus despite the fact that it is clean, devoid of skanks, and conveniently located.)

Vbig fan of this place.  they've expanded since i went to school here, which is fantastic since the overall feel is less crowded.  the more people you can fit in the bar, the shorter the line outside!  i haven't had food here in years, but i know it's super cheap.  drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them).  i've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes.  and you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and i dancing around like idiots to bon jovi.  but you know, murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that.  the jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for "play next," like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all.  and you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music.  i guess it just depends on the crowd.  either way, we always stop at murphy's when we come back to champaign and i know we always will!

Vi don't understand, and will never understand, why people will stand around at cowboy monkey for an hour waiting for a table when there are 10 tables open 5 feet away at barfly.  we sat at the barfly table closest to cowboy monkey and we could still hear the band and see into the club, so it was exactly like we were at cowboy monkey except the service was about 10 times faster and we didn't have to wait for a table.  barfly is clean, it didn't smell like a disgusting cigar smoked in ammonia like boltini does, and there weren't a bunch of tramps giggling around and exposing their nipples (as recently at guido's).  \u000a\u000ai did feel like kind of a loser for going in there since it's always so empty.

Vblah everyone always wants to go to mike and molly's when guido's and blind pig and boltini and cowboy monkey are too full (that makes it, what, the fifth best bar in champaign?) and i always get sad because it is so gross in there.  i guess maybe i was turned off the first time i went there when there were two port a potties, like, scaffolded on to the front of the building and like some homeless guys living in there?  that pretty much sums up the mike and molly's ambience for me, perma porta potties with homeless guys living in them.\u000a\u000athey have a really, really great booze selection; a million beers, awesome bartenders every time i've been there, and a zero skank factor, but the grime is too much for me.  even downstairs.  i went up stairs for the first time last night, hoping that when i got up there it was going to be some kind of comfortable hipster paradise, but instead i was just faced with a bunch of bacterial colonies in the shape of barcoloungers.

Vhmmm what to say about this chevy's.  our waiter brought us out chips and salsa with two cups of salsa.  he informed us that he wasn't allowed by chevy's management to bring us 2 salsas unless we asked for them, but that he was sucha renegade that he had brought us 2 and damn the man.  we obviously assumed he had only told us this / done this to get a better tip, since bringing us 2 salsas is more work for him than only bringing us one.\u000a\u000athen we ordered guacamole, which he didn't bring us.  so, not good for the tipping there.\u000a\u000athen when we told him to cancel our guacamole, he said he would cancel it from the bill but bring it to us anyway.  this twist made us decide that probably he just hated working at chevy's and wanted to screw them in any way he could, big or small, so we were back on his side again.\u000a\u000athen when he brought us the bill, he put it down between the two of us but said "here you go, sir" to my friend, which was really weird (my friend always gets handed the bill when we go out together since he is a man and i am a woman, but it always cracks us up because it never happens to us except when we are in champaign urbana, and then it happens every time.)

Vi should say up front that this review is based on chips, salsa, and a strawberry frozen margarita.  but you know, i feel like chips/salsa/margz are the fundamental building blocks of any mexican restaurant, and if they fail at those, they might fail at other things.\u000a\u000awhen my friend and i drove down for homecoming, we arrived a little early and couldn't check into the hotel yet.  chevys was just down the street, so we decided kick off our weekend of constant food and alcohol consumption by getting some drinks at the bar.  at 5 pm on a friday night, the place was amusingly empty, with the occasional random quiet man alone at the bar drinking margaritas (awkward) and a couple other tables of folks in illini gear (and steelers gear, for some odd reason.  they followed me here?)\u000a\u000awe saw that on fridays they have a $4 frozen strawberry margarita special.  that deal was calling our name, so we each got one.  they were all right - good texture, decent taste, we got a little buzzed, but nothing special.  the chips and salsa, however, were totally blargh!  watery salsa, weirdly textured chips - like, the chips were really weak and flimsy, not the good sturdy tortilla chips that can hold up to good salsa.  they weren't even worth eating.  also, the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check.  sorry, but we had dinner plans at papa del's, and didn't want to spoil our appetite!\u000a\u000a....why go here when you could drive a mile and go to dos reales?

Vhave to say, at 3pm on a monday afternoon, this place was actually not too shabby.  it was clean, had on some nice soothing tunes, we were the only people there so we got super fast service, and when i went back to pick up my french fries (which were actually good enough to entice my friend who didn't want any and doesn't usually eat french fries to eat some) i actually observed the line cook spraying down some cleanser and wiping an already clean counter.  \u000a\u000athe fish sandwhich is allegedly "the best," but i've never had it.  i wouldn't be surprised if it were worth trying.

Vbeen happy with dr. mcelroy.  the place is really clean, which must be so hard for a place with all kinds of animals running around through it all day.  dr. mcelroy neutered my pup and fixed his tiny hernia, gives him his shots and tells me what i need to do for him.  not the first vet i've been to in cu, but definitely the best.

Vi can't find it in myself to say something bad about people who stay up all night just in case my pup gets hurt, so they can help him.  \u000a\u000ait was pretty expensive, but the vet tech warned me when i called before i came in that there would be an $80 emergency visit and i get it... they can't ever know how many pets will come in overnight so it's going to be expensive.  i am glad i have pet insurance!  \u000a\u000amy emergency was on a saturday night, and our regular vet is vca which is not open on sunday.  if the emergency had been on sunday night, i might have waited until monday morning, but it wasn't.  \u000a\u000athe staff were nice to my pup, and the place was clean (for a vet).  it was super expensive, so you should know that before you go in, but if you need emergency care you need emergency care.

Vi like farren's pretty well for a happy hour type dinner.  the grilled steak salad and sweet potato fries are my favorites.  \u000a\u000ai've had super super annoying service more than once (not bad as much as way too interested in starting a conversation and becoming friends with the diners), and every single time my friend has ever asked the kitchen to hold the french fries he has gotten an extra huge heaping load of french fries.

Vwhen our green side salad came out of the kitchen, my dining partner said "well, this is already enough better than biaggi's that we'll never be going back there."  the greens were great, with perfect little red roma tomatoes and red onion; such nice greens that it would have been ok even without dressing.    i got a ginormous portion of pasta that i couldn't even eat half of even though it was completely delicious.\u000a\u000aour waiter didn't pester us at all, but we always had everything we needed.  second basket of bread, full water glasses, suggestions about drinks.  \u000a\u000aeven the clientele was less offensive than average.  when we walked out of the restaurant, i said "we were just in there for like an hour and nothing annoying happened the entire time!"  that is extremely rare on our friday nights in downtown cu.

Voh.  mah.  gawd.\u000a\u000aum, alums, you need to go back to your alma mater and check this place out.  as i remember it, cly's was the place where the beer formed a sticky film on the floor, the wine on wine night almost ate through the plastic cups, girls grinded drunkenly on poles on the second floor, and where i once spent 5 minutes on my 21st birthday before i had to be escorted home in my blacked out state.  classy, no?\u000a\u000awell.\u000a\u000ai just went back for a visit, and they redid the place.  completely.  they serve food and there is a coffee bar in the front!  the front part is all open-air now (like at firehaus), and the decor is about a million times classier than before.  the place was packed when no other bars were, probably because everybody is so excited to see its new makeover!  also, the whole back downstairs area is a total dance floor now, with glittering disco lights and a stage for girls to strut their skanky stuff!\u000a\u000aseriously, i was impressed. i mean, the clientele looks and acts exactly the same, but the decor is a stunning difference from the old cly's.  it looks good, although i must shed a tear for the trashy cly's of my college years....

Vugggh i hate this subway.  i hate it the most of any subway i have ever been in, including those i've been to in gas stations.  especially given that silvermine is right next door, i would never, ever go here except that i really like the subway tuna salad wraps and the silver mine tuna salad just can't compete.  the vast majority of the employees i have encountered at this particular franchise have been either cross-eyed (no joke) or unwilling to interrupt their cell phone conversations to make me a sandwich.\u000a\u000athe best part about this subway is that if it weren't so terrible, i probably never would have tried silver mine, and silver mine is awesome.

Vi stayed here with four friends when we came into town recently for a football game.  the rates were pretty decent - it wasn't homecoming or any special weekend - $135 a night got us a room (suite?) with two double beds, and a couch.  slept 5 comfortably.  there was plenty of space for us to spread out, but the bathroom was pretty small.  when you upen the bathroom door, the door swings like 1 cm past the toilet, it is that cramped.  nice shower though - when the first one of us took her shower, we heard her go "oh my god!" and were immediately wondering what she was up to - she alerted us that the showerhead was moving!  sure enough, it rotates.  i'm not sure if that adds much to the experience but it was sort of a funny twist.  we had a tv that faced one of the beds, a mini fridge, and a microwave.  i couldn't hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway.  free wi-fi that was pretty fast, and no password was required.  lobby was clean and attractive.  didn't try the pool, fitness room, breakfast, or any other amenities.\u000a\u000agreat place if you're here for a game, as it's an easy walk.  we even walked home from green street bars one night, and it only took maybe 20 minutes.  just a little over a mile, i think.  very doable if you're in decent shoes!  hopefully next year when the tradition continues, we can get a room here again!

Vwhen cu goes smoke free in january i fully expect myself to go to jupiter's like 100 times a month.  although i don't really like thin crust pizza, for some reason the jupiter's topping combinations always hit me just right.  especially the pizzas with meat on them.  yes.  meat pizza.\u000a\u000ai wish there were more seating, so i could bring more massive groups with me.  jupiter's is an extremely popular departmental happy hour site, and when even 20 of us show up we pretty much fill up all the seating in the entire bar.\u000a\u000apizza is good, beer is good, not too loud, lots of pool tables, very few skanks!

Vi had the 6 course tasting flight tonight at bacaro and it was incredible.  my friend and i ate and drank wine for 3 hours, and i felt completely taken care of but not intruded upon by our totally awesome, knowledgeable, helpful waiter the entire time.  \u000a\u000a100 thousand props to said waiter, who didn't give the check to my male dining companion just because there were two of us and my male dining companion was male.\u000a\u000ai can't agree with the other reviewers about the portions; i was full by the end of the third course and still had half a meal to go.  i think if i had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course i still would have been full.\u000a\u000athis is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant, but i will certainly go back if i ever have a special enough occasion again.

Vi loved the decor in the new radio maria tapas bar, but i was not crazy about the tapas.  the olives in our manchego baked olive dish had a bizarre citrus note that was rather offputting, and were way short on manchego.  our apple blue cheese spread appeared to be apple-free, and the blue cheese spread itself was runny.  \u000a\u000amy bloody mary was top notch; i'll have to do some serious research to figure out whether it surpasses guido's for best bloody mary down town.

Vyum i love jarlings!  i love the smell of the waffle cones inside, i love the cute chinese food takeout boxes they pack the pints in, i love sitting out on the wooden benches and watching the fourth of july fireworks, and i love that cold fudge and / or butterscotch can be mixed into anything!!!\u000a\u000athe new brownies that they use aren't as good as the old ones though.

Vlots of hate on yelp for this place - come on people and chill-ax. \u000a\u000acheck-in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes and i was on my way to the rental cars. sure they tried to up sell a few services but a polite "no thank-you" was all it took. btw, i get the same up sell routine at every major rent-a-car place so they are doing nothing different.\u000a\u000arental car was a nissan altima for $9 a day, it was clean but had a couple of scratches on it but for $9 a day i can handle the minor cosmetic blemishes. car worked flawlessly and the ac kicked butt in the hot arizona summer sun. i noted the scratches and handed in the form to the check-out person and we were on our way. note: this was probably the fastest car rental i have ever done in phoenix (and i do a lot here)\u000a\u000areturns was another breeze, i didn't even get a chance to remove my luggage and the return girl handed me my receipt and said "have a nice day."\u000a\u000abottom line: super fast check-out, super cheap prices, super fast returns, cars have a few more miles and some cosmetic damage that goes along with those miles but you save a bundle over the major companies. i will rent again.

Vneil and i had a great time last night on the 'burgh brew tour with molly's trolleys. the tour started at 5pm at penn brewery, then proceeded to east end, full pint, and finally boyd & bair vodka distillery.\u000a\u000apenn brewery was cool as usual. we got there a bit early to have a beer and chill at the bar. happy hour was going on, so 2 pints of beer was $6-- score! the tour started, and our guide gave us a little history about the place in the courtyard. we went back inside and had 3 beer samples (about 8-10oz each), a pierogi and a soft pretzel. the pierogi was delish, and the penn dark was the best of the samples. we all hopped on the trolley, and made our way to east end. the trolley is super clean and nice, and we got to do beer samples and trivia on the drive to east end!\u000a\u000aeast end brewery is a small operation, and they're primarily a growler filling station. i'll write my review of them, but it's a pretty chill place with helpful, hipster staff.\u000a\u000afull pint brewery is way out in north versailles. they're a larger operation situated in a big warehouse. they had 6-8 beers on tap, which you could sample or get full pints (hey, a pun!) of. the rye imperial stout, perc e bust, and all-in amber were my favs. we were supposed to get a tour of the brewing facilities, but for unknown reasons, that never happened. we still had fun hanging out with other peeps on the tour and the locals hanging out.\u000a\u000afinally, after a pretty long drive, we ended up at boyd and blair. b&b are the only vodka distillery in pa, and they run a pretty small operation with only 4 employees. despite the size, they've been wildly successful, and it was easy to see why after sampling. they make potato vodka from scratch, and we got a tour of how each step is done. it was great to have at least one educational tour on the trolley, and the owner did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. i'm definitely a fan! we all got back in the trolley which dropped everyone back off at penn brewery.\u000a\u000aall in all, it was well worth the $75/person for the tour. it made for a great birthday present for my hubby, allowing us to meet new people, taste lots of beers, and be safe while sampling!

Vit wasn't my first choice.  industry public had an hour wait and pusadees garden was closed.  but hambone's was a sturdy backup plan.  first thing, the service is extraordinary, the people who work here are very nice and work very hard to make sure everything is right.  the food is pretty average, but still better than i was expecting.

Vvery long and narrow -- kind of 2 1/2 stories with a small stage in the middle. not a great venue for seeing concerts due to the small size (unless the artists are really unpopular). as a bar, it seems like a fine place with the exception that they still allow smoking. the food was pretty horrible, but they have a decent selection of draft beers.

Vsome definite problems as a venue.  there is smoking in the bar up front, which creates problems for people who want to watch the shows.  the building is long and narrow, and the shows can be extremely crowded, with most of the audience standing.  often difficult to see the stage.  yes, this place has a lot of charm, but they could do a lot to improve the space as a performance venue.

Vthis place is simply amazing. our party of five ate on the pub side since there was a longer wait for the fancy side. we feasted on puffy pierogies, meaty wings and such fantastic pizza. for a drink, i had a soda (i believe it was brewed there) with vodka which was a good choice for me since i don't drink beer. this place is a bit pricey, but you've got to think about the costs that you rack up when you set up shop in a church! super holy hell, i will definitely come back to this place the next time i'm in pgh! i was actually bummed that zachary wasn't with me because this place would have blown him away!

Va lot's been written, so i'll try to be brief.  i was here on saturday with a couple friends, place was packed but found ample seating at the bar.  the space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  this place has outdoor seating, however i always seem to forget.  it has delicious brick oven pizza, with fresh sauce, and perfectly cooked cheese.  i only wish their crust was thinner.  the wine selection sucks, but the spirits offered are pretty ample.  they won't offer samples of the cask conditioned, which is okay because all there beer is pretty good and they offer samples of all the rest.  the stout was below average.  i had their "kobe" steak sandwich, for $11,,, really?? "kobe"?? either way, perfecty acceptable sandwich and the sweet potato fries are a nice touch.  friend had the salmon, she said it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  we tried the brie, which was about c level brie with nice breading and figs (nice touch!), the non-traditional perogies were no good, overcooked, overpriced and underflavored.  the service was better than most.  the bathrooms were big enough, with no lines that i saw, which was surprising with so much beer being drunk,,, oh well, i guess it's not possible for me to write a short review.  there's always next time.

Vpros: \u000a1. the brewery is located in a gorgeous church. i mean, it is really really pretty. the novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great. \u000a\u000a2. the brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. if you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. i have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. i can be particularly hateful about subpar beer. \u000a\u000acons; \u000a1. the wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that i have often been discouraged from going here. too many times i have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. once i sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, "for the pain." \u000a\u000a2. some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. i am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. the food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. they have a tempting "pierogie of the day" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. if you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. vegetarians have limited choices here. vegans will starve. \u000a\u000a3. church brew works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. this is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. the majority of people here are not like you. and you should be happy you are not like them. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000adespite all this, it is a really really pretty church! good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward.

Vcongratulations, church brew works, for making it on to the opening scene of the movie 'zack and miri'. you looked great in that shot, as usual - beautiful and confident. you do the city of pittsburgh proud.\u000a\u000aas for my 3 star rating, i just don't think this is the place to go for good food. for a cool place to drink and chill with your friends, this location is okay. and, of course great for tourists and returning ex-locals. but, it's definitely not somewhere i'd go regularly to grab a bite and gulp. if you do need to order something, i'd recommend the pierogies. \u000a\u000achurch brew works is like the movie star that doesn't have to impress on things that matter (like food) because they have the looks and fame already.

Vthey brew the beer on the altar -- enough said! \u000a\u000aseriously though, this is a cool restaurant with tons of indoor seating in addition to a nice outdoor courtyard. the food i've had here has been good and they have a nice selection of beer. definitely worth trying if you've never had dinner in an old church! try the pizzas -- they're excellent.

Vhaving waited nearly two years to try church brew works, i was sorely disappointed by the food and beer, but overwhelmed by the atmosphere. there's really no comparing the atmosphere to anything else - it's in an old church, of course, and the high ceilings and stained glass windows are overwhelming. unfortunately, my burger was subpar, and i've never really enjoyed any of cbw's beer - the fact that it was on tap from the brewery didn't help. furthermore, my waiter was incredibly odd - lame jokes, and all, which detracted a bit from the experience.

Vgreat place to take out of town guests.  my best tip for you is to ask for the bar menu, the food is better, and less expensive.  the pizza is delicious and creative.  the decor is impressive, although i find the lighting a little too dark.  this place has excellent food and wonderful beer.  great for groups.  there's additional parking in the back, but i often park on the street.

Vi've heard people talk of this place and thought to myself that i must go here one night.  the deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national tv that it's one of the best places to eat in the burgh.  she was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  so when my mom came down to cash in on her mother's day gift, my sister and i decided to bring her here to eat first.\u000a\u000athere was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  and there is one about to happen.\u000a\u000awhen you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  you can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  we chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.\u000a\u000aafter looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  my mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  sister decided on yinzer cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  and i couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  i also got a side of belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  these pirogi were amazing.  i was a bit worried at first when i saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  the belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  my mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  my sister's yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  it's just a cheesesteak...pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.\u000a\u000athe service was top notch here too.  the server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  the hostess when we walked in and i asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if i did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.\u000a\u000aeverything in here is interesting to look at.  while we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  even the bathrooms were nifty.\u000a\u000ai, however, cannot speak of the brews.  as i was driving, but i'm sure i will be back to partake in one or more.

Vi miss being a south sider, but that doesn't stop me from coming back here.  best eye doctor i could have chosen.  i just went here on a whim and because it was due time to have my eyes checked out.  best decision i had made.  \u000a\u000athis new location is by far the best idea they have had.  it feels roomier and nothing like being in an eye doctor office.  i don't mind sitting in the waiting room now.  i feel so comfortable going here and i feel like i am welcomed here.  \u000a\u000athe eye exams aren't that bad either, especially with how awesome the doctors are.  i had a few different ones being there on different occasions.  i usually see dr. siegel while there, but the past two visits i got to meet dr. pusz, they are both so kind and make you feel at ease when there.  \u000a\u000ai once saw dr. pusz for and emergency appointment and i felt 100% better after leaving there.\u000a\u000athe selection is so-so for frames, but i'm sure you can find one to fit your face.  \u000a\u000aone other good thing about the place is if you have something wrong with your glasses after receiving them, you can just walk right in and they'll have a look at them, fix them there on the spot for you or try their hardest to find the best solution for your problem.

Vi definitely had a favorable first time here last night. piper's pub is a british pub, with all the goodies. i had the scottish eggs and it was pretty good. i've never had scottish eggs, but i imagine that they were authentic and delicious. i didn't love them that much, but i could definitely appreciate what they were - hard boiled eggs wrapped in sausage dipped in hot sauce. around the table, my party had: ground lamb and chestnut shepherd's pie - it was not typical but really really good, some sandwiches - they were decent sized platters. i'm definitely going back there to try more food.\u000a\u000apiper's pub brings the best of unhealthy british foods for our consumption.

Vthis is an excellent pub that for some reason i never go to.  i was here on saturday and was really happy with the people i met at the bar and the staff was outstanding.  the pub itself is quite nice.  it has tin ceilings, copper bar (i think), plenty of plasmas, booths in the back, and a few hi tops scattered about.  i was really impressed with the whiskey selection listing even a japanese option.  they also a premium bottled beer selection and plenty of draught options.  i started with guiness, but then was intrigued by the cask option because i rarely see cask conditioned ale's in this town except for church brew works.  the cask condition was some type of winter ale.  it was good if a little too sweet for me.  i wasn't that hungry, but we did order a couple appetizers.  i ordered the ploughmans platter (cheese platter) and ordered the artichoke and red pepper dip.  i wouldn't have chosen this dip, but she seemed to like it.  it was okay i guess.  the portion was huge the dip was warm and had a decent flavor, but it seemed a little too greasy for my liking.  it was served with bread that could have been warmed up a bit.  the cheese platter was pretty good.  it was served with a delicious apple chutney, fruit and a  few gherkins.  there were two cheeses.  i think they were both chedder. one was flavored with guinness and i'm not sure what the other one was, but it was green and i actually preferred the green cheese.  overall this is a really good pub, with super friendly patrons, and a staff that's spot on.  i'll be back.

Vauthentic pub, good eats, good drinks, televisions with soccer, rugby, and pittsburgh sports.  \u000a\u000aopens stupidly early on weekends, so that they can catch european sports live.  when they're open early on weekends, they have a terrific brunch; please, please, please try the boxty brunch here.  (fried hashbrown potato pancake stuffed with other delicious foods.)\u000a\u000aone of the best bars in the city; if i was picking a top-five, this would be in.

Vthe things i take home from this store tend to be newer items in fair-to-good condition. this is not a good store for vintage or unique clothes. the prices skew fair to high. \u000a\u000athe dress selection is pretty extensive, and seems to be a treasure trove if you're looking for the kindergarten teacher jumper-style of dress. the furniture and housewares section is kind of worthless- most things i like are priced beyond my "flinch point" at this goodwill. they definitely have a concept of the "value" of items, and price accordingly. there is rarely cute furniture, but i did score a beautiful metal vintage cabinet (that appeared to be... i can't verify the origins) straight out of a 1950s science classroom for $10. \u000a\u000athey do have a private lot, which fills up kind of quickly. it's a giant pain because parking is so scarce over there by ss works. i am curious to see how long this gw can last across the street from that upscale strip mall experience. \u000a\u000aworth a note: this is the motherload of all goodwill dumpsters, but you will have to do some scaling/crawling (under/over tall fences) with a careful lookout stationed on carson to avoid being ambushed & caught. ive seen several working bikes come out of that dumpster.

Vbetween the two major goodwill stores in the 'burgh--the other one is on ohio street--this seems to be the better one.  parking here is a little tight--the lot is very small for this size store.  \u000a\u000aon the upside, this store is very well organized.  they usually have stuff according to size.  the menswear is very well organized  and extensive.  on the downside, you do have to do a lot of poking around to find what you are looking for--especially if you are into vintage dresses like i am.  this isn't so much a haven for vintage wear.  i would imagine that in tough economic times as these, people come here more and more just to find everyday wear.\u000a\u000athey do have a good selection of used books.  i bought "east of eden" from john steinbeck here for $1.00 and an old copy of "david copperfield" by charles dickens for 75 cents.

Vjust got back from the goodwill store.  me -n- the girl posse (my friends marla, sherry, and maryann) just kind of headed over here, spur-on-the moment.  we weren't really looking for anything in particular.  i did find a few used books i'd like to have.  but then again, i remembered the words i told myself, "no more used books, susan, until you read the ones you've already bought."  boy, that susan d. sure spoils all of my fun!

Vgoodwill is well known as a place where you can get used, newer clothes in good condition.  but did you know that it can be the perfect place to get your halloween costume?  i was searching for a polka dot dress 'cos i was dressing up as minnie mouse for halloween.  and lo and behold i found one here in my size.  \u000a\u000aof course i was minnie mouse because this past weekend, my husband rick and i took our niece and nephew out to idlewild park.  on halloween proper, minnie's sluttier sister maxine mouse will appear!

Vthis goodwill is the primary place i get work slacks.  thank you donaters for allowing me to dress for success for less! \u000athey have racks of slacks, khakis, blue jeans, skirts, dresses and shirts.  waiting for a dressing room can take forever, but there's nothing you can do about it, so just look at the 70's ties while you wait.  there's a reasonable selection of shoes and accessories, as well as home wares and electronics.\u000ain addition to hunting for halloween costumes, they also have a decent selection of holiday decorations that are fun to pick through.

Vokay, i've gotta upgrade this one to five stars.  i was here on friday thrifting with my friend maryann.  we were going through the racks of used clothes and other assorted consignment goodies, not having much luck, when he happened upon some used dvds.  and there it was. \u000a\u000a"parker lewis can't lose, the complete first season."\u000a\u000aholee shite!\u000a\u000a"parker lewis can't lose, the complete first season".\u000a\u000aone more time..."parker lewis can't lose, the complete first season"\u000a\u000ai'd nearly forgotten all about that show, but i used to watch it all the time when i was a teenager.  i didn't even know it was on dvd and i wondered who the hell would be getting rid of such a treasure.\u000a\u000afor those of you who don't know, "parker lewis" was an inventive early fox tv show that paved the way for such later fare as "malcolm in the middle" (only without that show's nastiness) and "scrubs".  i remembered how it was primarily a single-cam show with lots of fast edits and sound effects.  i remembered how it had odd colors in places and its quirky humor.  i remembered that parker lewis and his buds mikey randall and jerry steiner used their wit, some gadgetry, and their general cool to negotiate the world of high school.  parker would pull some stunts on the show, but they were generally out of kindness and a desire to help his fellow students.  and if he just happened to promote himself doing so, so much the better.  \u000a\u000abut what i'd forgotten was how it was an important bridge between the 80s and 90s.  it went from pastels to grunge.  and it's a riot seeing some of the gadgets they used--vhs tapes, two way radios (remember, no cel phones), analogue tvs, cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes!  doesn't make the show any less enjoyable watching it 20 years later.  oh yeah, and the catchphrases:  "not a problem", "mental note", and my favorite, "synchronize swatches"!\u000a\u000acoolness!

Vi love you goodwill.\u000a\u000ayou would think that would be a good enough review, wouldn't you?\u000a\u000athis goodwill location on the southside is amazing.  i love it because of how you can pull up and drop off your donations, then swing your vehicle in a spot and then go into the store and browse.  take a deep breath, that mixture of old, warmth, and donated is the scent of goodwill.\u000a\u000awhen i said browse before, i hope you have at least a hour to browse.  it's part of the experience.  if you don't have time to browse plan to come on a day you can just putz around in the store and not have to be in a rush to head out to work or something.  wouldn't want you to miss out on an awesome shirt, or maybe that coffee table you've been looking for is sitting there, or maybe somebody donated a cd you've been searching forever for.\u000a\u000atake your time here.  and if you plan on coming here, take time at home to clean out that closet, make room in your dresser, sneak out a gift you really didn't want from last christmas, then bring it with you, donate, then shop!\u000a\u000aoh, good tip: don't forget to ask for your tax receipt when you donate, every penny counts nowadays.

Vnuts to hitting macy's or target for after -christmas sales (although i did do that).  hitting up goodwill is the way to go!  and because it'd been awhile since we did some serious thrifting, my friend marla and i came here looking for some bargains.\u000a\u000aand find good bargains we did!  i found a beautiful ralph lauren cotton blazer.  i couldn't believe my eyes.  first of all, who gets rid of a ralph lauren?  second of all, who'd ever expect to find one at goodwill?  you'd expect to see something like that a good consignment shop.  marla found some gorgeous sweaters for herself.  \u000a\u000asometimes it pays to really poke around in a place like this!

Vthis goodwill is a *little* better than other goodwills i've been too. the clothes here are more modern and stylish and the crowd that shops here is younger. this store is small so i would recommend coming at least once a week to check for "new" items.

Vthis is my favorite divey type bar in the south side.  i have been going here for at least 10 years and it's nice to go to a place and know exactly what you're gonna get.  this place is usually the last stop of a long night.  i found myself there last night once again closing the place out, which unfortunately due to my advancing age and mellowing tempermant i find myself doing less and less frequently, thus the impetus for me to document this fine establishment.  it's located on e. carson st. next to the parking lot by the pittsburgh steak company.  it's plenty big and most folks spend their time located at the long bar to the left after you enter.  in the back there is a pool table and a bunch of booth seating.  it's really a shame because this is a lot of wasted space for an e. carson st. location.  they also have a fully operational kitchen in the back but don't expect a menu.  they may have served food long long ago, but do not now.  they did attempt to revive their kitchen about a year ago, but it didn't work out.  you'll mostly be snacking on bags of chips, crackers and beef jerky unless you luck out and cindy is behind the bar and is willing to make you a burger on the small grill behind the bar.  if she is making burgers you should order one they are surprisingly good, either that or i'm usually tipsy enough to appreciate anything warm when i'm here.  all of there bartenders, cindy, billy, etc. are all great and have been there for years.  this is definitely a last stop destination and usually never super crowded.  the folks are a pretty wide mix, but after midnight mostly mid 20 somethings and 30 somethings with a few local older yinzers mixed in.  they have a couple of tv's (no plasmas) and you could do a lot worse than to watch the game here.  in fact during the last steelers superbowl run i found myself here often.  also, the free ham bbq's aren't bad either.  this is not a place to order wine, but they do have a good beer selection including guiness on draught and a few imports.  they make a strong drink with most top shelf liquors available and the prices are cheap.  again, this is a great place to end the night and often closing time is on their own schedule.

Vamazingly awesome pasta salads and sammies. oh! and the grape leaves taste like demeter made them herself...divine! there is so much to choose from and everything i've tasted so far has been really tasty. however, a friend had the macaroni salad and she wasn't so thrilled, said it was extremely bland and had to add some flavor (good thing i don't care for macaroni salad!) \u000a\u000afabulous beer selection! \u000a\u000afast and friendly service.

Vthis is another place i can't believe no one else has rated yet.  my cousin and i were due to get our tattoos touched up.  after 13 years or so, my tattoo had begun to fade.  the place i had it done at is long out of buisness and when i talked to my artist, he wasn't a bit surprised.  \u000a\u000aanyway, my tat is of my four-string bass guitar and it's vertical, to the right of my left shoulder blade.  it is a very intricate pattern, but it just needed re-inking in a few spots.  i have no plans of ever getting rid of it either because i am proud of it!  yes tattoos do hurt, but my artist was professional and as gentle as good be with it.  it was a tad sore for a couple of days afterward, but not too bad.  and my tattoo looks so good again.  my cousin's does too!

Vi've never had any work done here but i've been with plenty of people who have and they are way overpriced and flashy. i never liked the vibe of the place. walk to in the blood or jesters court if you're in the s.s. but if you're willing to drive, head to human productions in bethal park...well, first make your appointment because it might be awhile...that's a good thing!

Vso...  i usually only eat in the sushi bar/bar area because i am not into the whole hibachi thing.  this place is usually very busy for happy hour, so if you just want to eat and not worry about a crowd, try a different place or come at a different time.  otherwise, it can be amusing to people watch here.  \u000a\u000apersonally, i come for the sushi.  ever since my friend introduced me to the hanalei roll, i can't resist it.  shrimp tempura, cream cheese, some other stuff, then tempura batter fried.  tastes so much better than it sounds, worth the $14 price tag (if done right) as it is double the standard sized roll.  the other rolls are all decent and the sashimi servings are huge.  if you are on a first date, beware - the pieces of sushi are so gigantic that you'll either 1) look like a pig stuffing it all into your mouth or 2) risk having the entire piece fall apart all over you as you try to daintily take normal bite sizes out of the sushi-piece.  you decide whether you will go for option 1 or 2!  oh, and just say no to the tempura appetizer.  it's not tempura, that would actually be japanese style.  no, what you will get if you order the tempura is american-style beer-battered shrimp and 3 pieces of vegetables, all for 11 bucks.  blech.\u000a\u000aservice is always a bit shoddy in the bar area, but to be fair, that place gets crazy busy.  so...  food, 4; service 2-3 depending on the night and business; atmosphere, 3.  but hey, if you just want that busy happy hour scene, this is a place to go to!  p.s.  parking can be a pain.  it's carson in the southside, what do you expect?

Vi go here a few times a month, mostly because i think the bar scene is probably one of the most fun in pittsburgh.   it gets pretty crowded especially on the weekends, but the staff does a good job especially after you go there a few times and they know who you  are.  it's the only place i know of in pittsburgh that on any given day (even a monday or tuesday) there will be a good crowd at the bar with a higher girl to guy ratio than the usual dudefest at most bars.  the hibachi is better than most.  it's definitely better than benihana, but probably not as good as shogun in monroeville.  the only thing i don't like about the hibachi (or any hibachi) is that after the meal you smell like a diner short order cook because of the oil from the grill.  the other menu items are pretty average at best.  the marinated beef tips and chicken lettuce wraps are okay appetizers.  the edaname is pretty hard to mess up and the miso soup is about average.  the sushi is awful.  i mean i guess the rolls are edible, but you can hide the quality by adding a lot of junk to cover up the flavor.  the sashimi (whish is really all that i order) i found to be really poor quality and the way it was sliced was not at all how sashimi should be sliced.  i really don't understand how this place wins best overall restaurant and best sushi  in pittsburgh.  it really makes no sense.  most of the people i know agree that the hibachi is good, but overall the restaurant isn't that good and the sushi not good at all.  however, i have a  friend who is one of the chefs assures me that the quality of ingredient is good.  overall, i suggest if you eat here the hibachi is pretty good and fun if  you are having a sit down dinner.  if you are eating at the bar try to stick to the edamame or maybe one of the appetizers mentioned.  i strongly suggest staying away from the sushi, but if you  must stick to the most basic of rolls (california roll, etc.).  in fact, if you are not sitting down for hibachi go eat at dish on the same street and head to nakama only for the bar.

Vit's interesting that one of the most crowded restaurants in the south side (possibly, all of pittsburgh?) has such bad ratings on yelp. i think yelpers have it right in the case. nakama totally did not live up to the hype for me. i had the hibachi and it was just mediocre. the chef / entertainer wasn't even that good - no cool tricks and he didn't even try throwing food in my mouth. the place was so loud that there is no way you can have a decent conversation if you come with a group of people. and, i swear they celebrated 10 birthdays during the hour we were dining there. they have this irritating gong that they bring out. you can't hear the guy next to you, but you will hear every birthday dinner that night. \u000a\u000aa bunch of my co-workers like nakama's sushi bar, so when i get a chance to try it, i'll update my review. until then, i'm not quickly planning my next nakama outing.

Vone of the coolest meals i have ever had. watching a hibachi chef cook my food in front of me was a real treat.\u000athis place gets super crowded, so come early (or really late) and try making a reservation (although they will still probably make you wait).\u000awe had to wait a long time before they took our order and a lot more time after that before they started cooking our stuff before us, but once that starts, it all really becomes worth it.\u000ai am vegetarian so had miso soup, stir-fried mushrooms, vegetables and tofu with sticky rice (and sake!!).. it was all delicious... watching your food get made in front of you makes it soo much tastier.\u000aportions are enormous, so don't overorder.\u000agreat place to catch up with friends and have a lot of fun.

Vnakama tries to be very trendy, but i have experienced much better sushi for a better price.  still, the sushi is better than many people claim.  i had very good service here.  and there is some great people watching.  but we have much better choices for japanese food in pittsburgh.

Vrecently caught a show at the (relatively) recently renovated rex theater, marking my first show there. i have to say, i'm a pretty big fan of the venue. as you enter, to the right there is a bar area and to the left a stage: a small, square room with a slightly slanted floor and a balcony behind it. ideally the slanted floor should give shorter people in the back a better view, and i have to say that while i am a taller person, the view from the back was excellent, giving a full view of the stage.\u000a\u000athe house lighting is decent and the soundsystem is loud for the space with great bass, which makes it pretty good for dance music and such. unfortunately, i spent most of my time too close to the stage to actually hear how it sounded, so i can't comment on it being any better than loud.\u000a\u000adidn't really notice the staff, which is always a good thing. they get a fairly decent variety of shows here as well, working with grey box productions. apparently they do some non-music events.\u000a\u000adefinitely worth catching a show here, in a town with quite a few venues worth missing a show at.\u000a\u000aoh and venue capacity is probably about 500-600

Vi had a veggie hoagie and cheese fries. the fries were thin and went straight from the bag to the fryer, the cheese 'sauce' was cheese powder mixed with too much water and my hoagie was a bunch of fried veggies (even the lettuce) poured over a burnt bun. they also made the mistake of putting canned mushrooms in the mix. i loathe canned mushrooms! blah, yuck, gross! \u000a\u000ai'm giving this place 2 stars as a vegetarian,  perhaps if i ate meat the pickle barrel would score higher. it is dirt cheap and if they had veggie alternatives i would definitely return.

Vmediocre at best.  see that delicious looking picture up there that shows you how great the chicken tenders are?  well that's exactly what i ordered, except for mine, they came fried a little extra.  i might be being kind with that.  the were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating.  no matter what i dipped them in i still tasted the burnt-ness.\u000a\u000anext time i order from here, i'll make sure to order something that doesn't come from the fryer.

Vi stayed here last night, so i could safely enjoy all of the south side festivities after a sb win.  this is a very relaxed b & b which is good for me.  did that just rhyme?  okay, regrettably i can't give a full and complete review because my total time spent here awake not including my shower was about 7 minutes.  i did take a few pics so that may fill in some of the blanks.  it's located off of carson st. at 21st and sarah.  it's close enough to e. carson that you can do the full loop if you are so inclined.  check in is at 2 pm, but i arrived around noonish and was able to go right in.  the parking is on - street except for a couple of spots in a small lot to the side of the building.  the guy i spoke with said only park in the lot if i can't find a space.  well, i've been side swiped enough in the s. side to know how welcome off street is, so i can't say i looked too hard for an on - street spot.  the building itself is quite nice and historic.  it has iron gates, high ceilings, marble and cherry wood.  the entrance is a big double door that was wide open.  they have a lock on it, but it wasn't activated.  the first floor is large with a couple sitting rooms to your right a few tables for breakfast and a kitchen in the back.  there also is a courtyard in the back, but i didn't use it.  i was pretty singleminded yesterday.  i entered and there was a note to my left with my name on it and directions to my room.  i call the phone number to let him know i arrived and that was the first and last interaction i had with any staff of any sort which is fine with me.  he also seemed pretty disappointed when i told him i doubt that i'd be up by 830 am for breakfast.  he said he would make me whatever i wanted and i'm pretty sure i missed out on a good breakfast this morning.  my room was at the very top of the house two long flights of steps up.  it was the margaret jackson suite.  the bedroom itself was pretty small with this 13" tv in the closet for my viewing pleasure.  however, the bedroom did also have a sitting area next to the room with a nice fireplace some chairs and books.  the bed was crazy comfy.  it was one of those swede temperpedic deals that costs like a million bucks!  it was the first time i slept in one and it was great.  the bathtub was okay and stalked with some surprisingly decent shampoo/conditioner, however no soap.  luckily i bring my own.  i left arround 10 am this morning.  the total cost was $200.  you can stay at the holiday inn on 10th for about $50 less, but i think i'll try this place again and not skip breakfast this time.  i hear this place does a lot of business for receptions and is quite good if you have a small wedding party.  one last thing that was weird.  there is no door from the bedroom to the bathroom.  so, if it's your first getaway with that special someone be prepared to really get to know them.  there is no privacy from the bedroom to the bathroom.  hopefully the other suites provide a little more privacy.

Vi agree pretty much with the other reviewers that the burgers are fantastic.  i happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years i've been hangin in the s. side i never stopped prior.  the space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  the only one complaint that i have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when i first walked in.  i was greeted warmly by one of the servers "li li" i believe.  she was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  the bartender was "bear".  he was a good typical burgh' bartender.  he served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  i ordered the "ultimate burger" which i ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as i witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  the soup was forgettable.  the broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  it really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  incidentally, i had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like i lucked out with the order.  the burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  the burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  the burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  i'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  it very much reminded me of a tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but i can't bring myself to say it).  the staff was so friendly i found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  i will go again and stick to the burgers.  the rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again i think the burger is the star.  incidentally, i was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity.

Vi had wanted to try this place for a while and finally got my chance the other day after my friend hanna suggested.  it's a small restaurant on e. carson st.  you enter off the sidewalk and walk into a small arrival area with a very small bar to the right.  the bar really isn't that functional and i'm guessing not used too much.  the dining room is bright with relaxing colors and a bookshelf on one side of the room and large windows with a view of the street on the other.  it has a "homey" feel to it.  the tables are reasonable spread apart with fresh flowers on each table.  we were sat at a good table with a nice view of e. carson.  the service is better than average.  we had a friendly waitress who was pretty error free except for forgetting my friends glass of wine.  the meal started with some nice crusty french bread with room temp. butter.  then i had the pate', which was not what i expected being pork instead of liver.  nevertheless, it was very tasty.  my friend had a good looking salad.  my entree' was the chicken.  this was delicious and it was how chicken should be served in a restaurant.  it wasn't just the breast, but some of the tastier cuts served in a nice broth with root vegatables.  it was delicious and total comfort food.  my friend had the trout, which looked very good.  we both had the sorbet, which was delicious.  i especially liked the coconut flavor.  this was a great meal for a very reasonable $35 each prix fix.  the wine selection was pretty good.  i'll definitely go again.

Vthis is a pretty unique dive bar and a pittsburgh original.  i don't go there much now, but i did have the occassion recently to be there at around  830am on a saturday.  i couldn't believe how many people were there and the mix of the crowd.  there were people there my age who  had obviously had a long night that turned into an early morning.  there were also "grinders" who just got done working at the mill or whatever and were there to have a cold meatloaf sandwich and a beer for breakfast.  there was also a guy there who was trying to sell me a pair of his shoes.  there can be a lot of meatheads there sometimes late at night, but if you are looking for a good dive bar open 365 days a year i suggest jack's rose bar, especially before 9 am.

V2.5 rounding up because of the free popcorn on the bar!!\u000a\u000awow! what a mix. this bar is hit or miss, the crowd varies night to night. i generally stay away from south side bars unless a friend wants to meet up and for some reason my bff loves this place...maybe its the free popcorn or the fact that cotton eyed joe is always played when we're there...coincidence? i think not.

Vgot here before the crowds on bourbon....err i mean carson st. started to roll in.  it's a much different atmosphere when there isn't the rowdiness of the college/young adult crowd in there.  you can actually sit and enjoy a libation and talk amongst yourselves.\u000a\u000adrink are definitely reasonably priced, which is great for a place that has so much competition.\u000a\u000ahalf the time i was distracted by all the kick ass signs hanging on the walls/ceiling.\u000a\u000abe sure to put your nose where it says for an amazing view.

Vto each their own and excuses doesn't strike me as my kinda place. saturday night they had live local bands playing that drew an "alternative" crowd... everyone seemed to know each other and was either a girlfriend of someone in the band or girlfriend's friend. two blonde girls were sitting in the middle of the place, rocking out but looking very out of place without black hair, dark clothes, tattoos and piercings. \u000a\u000athe drinks, while cheap, were gross. i got a maker's sour but it tasted really really odd. haven't tried their food, doubt i will.

Vi would love to see the city of pittsburgh support theater with more dedication and passion. sure, lots of yinzers have annual subscriptions to the benedum center to catch the lion king or wicked when it comes to town. but, what about the smaller, unknown plays that need some support? we're not just talking about watching shows here, we're talking about supporting the arts, encouraging aspiring playwrights and even lesser known seasoned playwrights to bring their works here. you may not be able to brag to your co-workers the next day like you did when you saw rent, but you might be exposed to the next great play.\u000a\u000ai've been to city theatre a number of times this past year thanks to a friend's annual subscription. i've watched good shows, boring shows, and some that i really loved. i'm a big fan of good old dialogue - the kind that makes you really know a character, whether you like them or not, you are intrigued by their story. i've seen some good actors on the stage, a few were/are still students at nearby carnegie mellon's musical theater or acting programs. watching a play in its beginning stages is intriguing, especially when you see the actors nail the character right on spot. i love it. \u000a\u000abut what finally encouraged me to write this review was last night's show "speak american". it was the first showing for a story that probably hits home for many locals. the setting is pittsburgh in 1904, where some steel mill immigrants workers were learning english from a curious and passionate teacher. the play explores each character, where they came from, what their dreams are, and the struggles that they face. \u000a\u000alike i said, i would imagine this story to intrigue the locals, but i don't even know if people know (or care) that this show is playing. again, it was opening night and the theater was maybe 60-70% full. i know it was a thursday evening, so i'm hoping that the weekend will see better attendance. but, either way, the local interest needs to increase so that this local gem can continue to bring good shows. this is a great time to check out city theatre if you haven't already - ticket prices are usually pretty fair, and if you call the box office they can always offer student prices, buy one get ones, etc. \u000a\u000aalso, i'd love to see a younger generation in the audience too, because usually when i go i am one of the youngest people there by a long shot... and i'm not that young.

Va bit of background.  the bill deasy concert in washington, pa my girlfriends and i were planning on seeing was sold out.  so we searched for something else we could do on a girl's night out.  it'd been awhile since i'd been to city theatre, so i suggested we head over to city theatre to check out "late night catechism".  i was a little skeptical at first.  i thought this play might be geared for old-line catholics.  i'm a "non-practicing" 30-something catholic (to put it mildly) and my gfs marla and sherry are a couple of nice jewish girls.  i was wondering whether or not we'd get the humor.  but i'd heard good things about this play, so off we went.\u000a\u000abut the show is terrific.  kimberly richards played the feisty "sister" who teaches classes on every subject from purgatory to prenuptial agreements.  man did i remember the pre-cana sessions rick and i attended before we got married!  this was an audience participation type show and i understand no two performances are exactly alike.  \u000a\u000athe theatre itself is a nice, intimate venue.  as angela c noted, pittsburgh needs more of the smaller theatre.  i've long been a fan of the arts, especially the lesser-known.  i've long supported the films at the regent square theatre, i like to support local music, and i'm a fan of local theater.  a trip to city theatre is well worth it.

Vthis is as much a concert review as it is a review of the venue.  club cafe is one of the great intimate venues in pittsbrugh.  i've seen several shows here in the past and i'm surprised i haven't written a review of it before.  it's true, the sound quality can be a little bit hit or miss.  and because it's small, you have to get there early if you don't want to stand for the whole show.  those slight drawbacks aside, the service here is friendly, the appetizers are good, and the drink selections are decent.\u000a\u000amy girlfriends and i were here this past weekend to see bill deasy.  having been thwarted in our attempt last weekend (because the tickets were sold out), we saw him here.  it kind of worked out for the better because last week's show was in washington, pa.  club cafe is much closer to my house in squirrel hill.  i've been bill deasy fan for years dating back to his bill deasy band days and i would get an older relative to take me to his all-ages shows.  i've seen him in each format he's played in:  bill deasy/bill deasy band/gathering field.\u000a\u000ai can remember when in 1995 with gathering field, he scored a huge regional hit "lost in america".  that song is based on jack kerouac and 15 years later it still gets to me, especially the line "he silenced her raging seas".  the song and album gathered the attention of atlantic records who reissued the album in 1996, but the album and subsequently the band were quickly forgotten when atlantic went through a period of restructuring.\u000a\u000athe great thing about deasy is he has continued writing strong material.  his stuff varies including folk rock, alt country, roots rock, and rock-n-roll.  one thing i like is he's still not milking it off of "lost in america" and this past weekend's show was ample proof of that.  if you like bruce springsteen & the e street band, tom petty & the heartbreakers, son volt, woodie guthrie, et. al., then you owe it to yourself to check out bill deasy/bill deasy band/gathering field.  \u000a\u000athe opening act was laura shay, an up-an-comer from philadelphia.  i didn't know too much about her (in fact i knew nothing about her), but she seemed to hold her own as the opener.  she's like singer trina hamlin, playing introspective and passionate music.

Vi really like this place. its very small and intimate, that being said it can get very crowded for shows. last time i was there was to see murder by death which in my opinion was a perfect venue to see them play. drinks can be expensive and the bartenders service is lackluster, but that's how the story goes.

Vthis is a small acoustic club that is definitely worth the visit.  there is limited seating so plan to arrive early if you want a seat.  the food is pretty good and the service is very good.  i have seen some great shows here and plan to go back often.

Vwe stopped by for what was advertised as "50 cent wing night," either meat or seitan.\u000a\u000ahowever, we were told after asking for a menu that they only had tofu avocado sushi for food that night.\u000a\u000ai asked if they had a drink menu, which they do, and the selection of cocktails was impressive.  however, the menu was so sticky and disgusting that we just left.\u000a\u000asorry, lava lounge...i wish we could have hit it off.

Vplenty of good times have been had at the lava lounge. i've heard some pretty decent local bands here, 80's night used to be pretty amazing (i haven't been there in like, 2 years because all i ever do is work, damn i hate growing up!), friends of mine used to dj on mixed tape wednesdays - that was pretty rad (where else would you hear chromeo and portishead and city & colour all in one night). i dig the food specials but don't be fooled! they do not have a full menu. the veggie tacos are steller and the seitan wings are good but very small. i only drink beer but the martini menu has some offerings that sound pretty yummy. nights start off pretty slow but by midnight the place (especially the dance floor) gets pretty crowded. because it is situated along carson street, the crowd is usually diverse - a lot of regulars and a lot of crawlers just stopping in on their way from one bar to the next.

Vi went here last friday, and it was my first pittsburgh bar experience!  what a great way to get acquainted with the bar scene.  this is totally my kind of place.\u000a\u000adrinks were a little pricier than i like, but given that the bar is awesome, i'm not really surprised or too disappointed.  pregame first and you'll be dandy.  the decor made me feel like i was in a trendy cave.  we went into the back room, put our drinks on these cool glowing tables, and danced to the great 80s music!  i love 80s tunes, especially when the music is familiar, when it makes you go "omg i love this sooooong!"  also, the music wasn't too loud - we could dance and talk without totally screaming.  i saw some pretty cool tables, one was a lot lower than the rest of the bar, like it was down in a pit - guess you have to come pretty early to claim that cool spot.  anyway, i had a great time at lava lounge, and would come back any friday.  i'd just rather drink somewhere else first, somewhere a little cheaper.  my mixed drink with flavored vodka was $5.75, and i think their "martinis" were $8 or $9 - a girl in our group got one and really didn't like it - i tried it and found it pretty unappetizing myself.\u000a\u000acome for the atmosphere, and maybe one simple drink or two!

Vwhat else is better than sitting in a pit inside a bar that looks like you're inside a volcano??? nothing!  (do be careful though getting into the pit, you don't need to fall)  the decor is amazing, they did an outstanding job to make it feel like you really are experiencing an inside of a volcano, not that i personally have been inside a volcano to be able to compare.\u000a\u000adrinks are amazing, everything you can think of and more.  djs are excellent when spinning their sounds.  the crowd is always lively.  if  you are in a bad mood entering the place you definitely will leave out of there in a better mood.  \u000a\u000ai love being able to just sit and collect my thoughts in the pit.  but seriously, watch your step.  it's great to get down there faster, but not worth the pain.

Vthis place has a serious identity crisis. the facade of the building looks interesting and authentic, like it would be a place to get a great beer, meet some interesting people and eat good bar food. the inside, however, has the disney channel blasting on the flat screen and horrible drinks. there was one waitress for the entire place, who apparently was the owner's wife, and was getting no help from the owner who sat and watched her work. they had a $4 bloody mary special, so i gave it a go; and i tried the bacon cheeseburger. the mary was so bland and boring. it came with no fixin's, was made with tomato juice, cheap vodka and pretty much nothing else. the burger was ok. i doubt i'll be back here.

Vthis was a very pleasant surprise.  i've walked or driven by this restaurant probably over 100 times and always thought to stop in, but never quite got around to it.  this oversight was remedied last night upon serendipitously discovering a $14 buy one get one entree in the "entertainment" book.  you've probably noticed the restaurant as well if you spend any time in the s. side.  it's located across the street, somewhat caddy corner to nakama.  the parking in the south side is always pretty horrible even on weekdays that's why it's so nice that the nakama valet also parks for this restaurant (incidentally, the valet fee just went up to $7 from $5).  it is in one of the great old buildings in the historic south side.  think "dish", but a little bigger with a larger bar area and more tables.  the ceilings are high.  there is plenty of wood.  there's a relatively large bar compared to the number of tables.  in the entrance room there are maybe 5 or 6 tables and then in the back there are another small group of 4 or 5 tables.  we were greeted quickly upon entering and then directed to the back room.  the server, lisa i believe initially was going to seat us right next to the swinging door to the kitchen.  thankfully, she wasn't opposed to our wish to sit in the front room that had more space.  i ordered a ketel, dirty and annie had a glass of zin.  i don't think they had any bottles over $30 for wine.  however, the ketel was a bit steep at $10.  the menu is relatively large having most of the italian staples you'd be used to with a few more creative dishes.  this makes this restaurant especially appealing given annie's tame palate and my more adventurous one.  we started with an order of the "roasted sicilian sausage" which was delicious.  we are off to a good start.  it was very flavorful bite size sausage roasted and then tossed with a lovely olive oil mixture of onions, yellow, green and red peppers.  it was also served atop a homemade provolone stick, which they said they can make as an order even though they don't put it on the menu.  as an entree annie ordered the thin spaghetti with an alfred sauce and added chicken.  the server said it was no problem to have the alfredo without garlic which means they make it fresh.  the entrees are served with toasted bread and butter and a salad (no soup substitutions) and a side.  the pasta was pretty good.  i mean, who doesn't like cream, butter and cheese with chicken?  annie also tried the wedding soup which was somewhat bland.  i settled on salmon.  i wanted to try the crispy salmon that's on their website, but it wasn't on the menu.  i had the "horseradish encrusted salmon".  the serving was quite large, over 8 oz. i'd guess and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  i was worried about the horseradish being too hot, but sadly really couldn't taste any bite at all.  the chef was also a little heavy handed with the breading.  the side of sour cream mashed potatoes was delicious.  the sour cream gave it an almost "light" contrast.  all in all this was a very nice evening and a pretty good value.  the dinner including three drinks, appetizers and entrees' was much less than $100 including tip and in conjunction with the entertainment coupon.  also, the server gave us some type of frequent visitor card that entitles you to a free app' i think for every $100 you spend.  if i were just to judge this place by the food and service i'd probably only give it 3 stars, but the atmosphere and value component bump it up to 4 stars.  we'll be back.

Vi've only been here once and according to my friend, when he was here earlier in the year it was waaaaaaay better but i found the food very bland and warm, friendly service and cute atmosphere couldn't make up for it. \u000a\u000awe tried the crab and artichoke dip and for dinner, inspired by kitchen confidential, i had one of their specials, a flounder filet with polenta. i'm usually expecting polenta to be this creamy, mushy puddle of heaven but here it was more like a quiche. so there was the flounder and a slice of polenta on their opposite sides of a plate, they didn't seem to go together. i wonder if it has anything to do with skipping out on the salsa that was supposed to go on top of the fish but i can't see how some chopped tomatoes would've made this any better. the dip was also plain and largely unmemorable. \u000a\u000ai did like the decor and the format, they have a smaller, quieter back room with just a few tables and a nice-looking, dark bar and more seating in the front. it's really romantic and i wish the food was tastier.

Vi'm tempted to wonder why there are only 3 reviews for this place, and why it always seems to get passed up as people walk down carson street in search of exactly what the real mccoy claims to serve, but then i remember that i'm part of the problem - the same kind person who walks by every time he wanders down east carson looking for good food at a reasonable price, and simply says "huh, look at that" as i walk past.\u000a\u000awell today i figured while i take a break from looking for modern furniture that is way out of my price range that i would finally stop in. the menu is simple: about 8 sandwiches, halves are $3(some are $3.15), wholes are $6(some are $6.30 or so). extra onions, extra peppers, extra dressing is an extra $0.10 per half each. on the wall there are what appear to be artist renditions of what the sandwiches might look like. \u000a\u000athe lady behind the counter took my order and had it ready in a few minutes. she fumbled around trying to fit all of the onions and peppers snug in the cheese sandwich, claiming she hates nothing more than when she gets a sandwich home and has to rebuild it. i paid my $3.21 in cash and left her the rest of the $5 because she was so friendly, she thanked me profusely.\u000a\u000athe sandwich was awesome, the bread and the peppers were perfect, and the onions were thin exactly the way it should be. despite her best efforts, things eventually did fall out of the bottom of the sandwich, but it wasn't too bad.\u000a\u000ai almost took off a star because i asked for mayo and they had only miracle whip... but i'm not going to be the one to ruin the streak. also, someone donate a table and some folding chairs to this place.

Vi was hungry, and judit was running late, so i ran across e carson to try out the real mccoy. what a fantastic little hole in the wall! if you're looking for good, cheap eats, come here. half (at least 6in, seemed bigger) hoagies start at $3. three dollars! i think the most expensive one was still less than $4. the menu is limited, but, really, how many sandwich options do you need? the lady running the joint is really sweet, and the whole place has a very home-cooked feel to it. i went with the polish ham and provolone and a side of potato salad, and it cost less than $5. best part? it actually tasted good. fresh bread, plenty of ham, sour pickles--yum!\u000a\u000acash only, and take-out only. no tables or chairs to enjoy your cheap eats.

Vlet me just state for some that i did not come here because of ddd and no, i did not try what was featured on the show.  i came here...well, simply because i was hungry and thirsty.\u000a\u000aupon walking in this place makes you feel like you are in the wrong place, that is until you are warmly greeted by the bartender.  we didn't even have our coats off and were asked if we wanted something to drink.  we quickly settled on a draft and were brought menus.  now, people, this place has a very small menu.  on top of the small menu there are specials that appear to change often.  a note to people also is that this place specializes in breakfast, half of the menu is for breakfast fare.  i almost ordered a special but decided to go with something from the menu.  i got the blt and a side of fries; my friend got a cheese quesadilla and onion rings.\u000a\u000athis is the nice part, everything is cooked fresh when you order it!  my blt was amazing.  the bacon was crispy, tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, and the bread was just toasted.  the fries are fresh cut.  so no frozen here, cut and then thrown in to fry.  with the light touch of mayo on the sandwich it surely hit the spot.  the quesadilla and onion rings looked good too, but i kept my mind on my own plate.\u000a\u000athis place, even though it is nothing more than a hole in the wall that has been there for "17 years" (i believe that's what the sign says outside) is amazing and charming.  it's small in here, so if you have a big party, don't expect to feel comfortable in here.  it's dark from the walls and small windows, which to me made it feel warm.  the decor is about as typical as you can expect with many places like this.  i totally liked that their dishes were mixed and matched.  like they went to goodwill next door and just bought every plate they had on the shelf.  it gives this place the "we don't go with the flow" feel that makes it work.\u000a\u000aafter a satisfying meal the check arrived.  that was like the cherry on the cake, for two meals and two drafts, $15.  i kid you not.  totally worth checking this place out for food and not just drink.

Vzenith is seriously one of the best places that i have ever been. on sundays there is an all you can eat vegetarian buffet. there is hummus, macaroni salad, tabbouleh, and about five different dessert items to choose from. i think that all the desserts are vegan too. that would be enough for $10, but no, you get to choose a hot entree and a tea. i got blueberry pancakes that were to die for. it's such a great concept. also progressive is their seating policy. if you have 3 people in your party and another party has two in their party and a table for five happens to open up, you may be sat with another group. it was a wee bit awkward at first but we started talking and made food friends. i seriously loved this place and i'm so glad that natalia took me there.\u000a\u000asince there is generally a long wait, the fact that the waiting area doubles as an amazing thrift store makes it an easy wait. the awkward part is carrying all the stuff you want to buy into the dining area and then finding a safe place for it until you pay. few things have prices on them but it's not an arm and a leg for most things. i wound up with some japanese owl coffee cups from the 70's and some vintage wild floral printed fabric.

Vokay, maybe i should have known better than to go to this super-vegan friendly place for brunch with my vegan friends.  but i would love to think that i could be vegan...  if only i wasn't allergic to soy!  (we're talking i-may-need-that-epi-pen-that-i-don't-carry-around kind of allergy.  haven't gotten there yet, but unfortunately, the allergy gets worse and worse.  :(  and i'm asian.  kinda sad, i know.)  what i did eat before i needed to stop, was yummy!\u000a\u000athis place is great, seriously.  wish i could go back!  i always shed a little tear when everyone else goes...  and leaves me behind.  for my own good.

Vi want to love zenith. i go there about every 6 months, and i try again, harder each time, to like zenith. it's an antique shop, and i love antiques! they serve vegan and veggie food, which i love! they are known for their brunch - my lifelong favorite meal! i know everyone loves zenith because it is part antique shop and part vegan restaurant, and there is a buffet of vegan sides, salads, and vegan cakes, and you get a vegan entree, coffee/tea, and buffet for only $10 on a sunday morning, and a lot of the salads/buffet items are delicious. i respect all of these reasons for loving zenith.\u000a\u000aand yet, i consider zenith to be the biggest sore disappointment in my pittsburgh experience. \u000a\u000afirst of all, i hate waiting in lines. i hate that you have to time the exact moment of your arrival (to beat everyone else) and wait for zenith to start seating. or you can arrive when they are open, and wait in a 30 person line to be seated.  i cannot express how deeply this irritates me. \u000a\u000ai hate sitting cafeteria style at tables with strangers -- okay, honestly, i don't hate strangers, but i do hate non-consensual seating with ex-girlfriends, ex-friends, ex-co-workers, and other parties from the past i'd rather put to bed. pittsburgh is an awful small town for such a big city, certainly i can't be the only one wishing those demons would stay somewhere far away from my brunch table?\u000a\u000athird, their table service is perhaps near the lowest-ranking in the city. if it is 90 degrees in june, and people are sitting in an un-air-conditioned room, with one lazy ceiling fan, and your server literally cannot bring you a glass of water.... well, there's a serious problem. \u000a\u000aand finally, the food. the brunch buffet salads/sides are sometimes "good" but mostly mediocre, and i don't think the entrees are ever very good. \u000a\u000awe have a problem where we conflate quantity & quality. our collective vegan brunch love for zenith is exactly this issue. as vegans, you are not used to seeing a table full of cake you can eat. so when you do see that, you will rave about it. even if the cake is dry and flavorless, you will eat it, and you will go back for seconds.

Vcan't say i thought the food here was that great.  it's a very interesting experience though, and worth trying at least once.  the breakfast bar food (buffet style) is much better than the hot food, imo.  i had blueberry pancakes, which were too dense and not blueberry enough.  i think everyone in my party agreed that the food was average.\u000a\u000ai will say that the atmosphere is extremely unique and lends itself to good conversation.  the servers are fun as well, and you can't beat the prices.  it seems like it would attract a hipster crowd, except families and old people go too.  go figure.

Vzenith's all about the atmosphere.  you're in an antique shop, it's so cool!  the food's pretty good; not super spectacular but definitely worth it for the price.  you get an entree, the buffet bar, and the choice of a hot or iced tea.  i had their scrambled eggs my first time, which didn't wow me at all, and the moroccan stew this morning, which was definitely good.  the best part is definitely the buffet bar and the assortment of cakes; i really like their different pastas.\u000a\u000ayou gotta get to zenith early.  i've been to zenith twice; once i got there just after 10 am to wait in line for when they open at 11 am while today i got there after 12 pm.\u000a\u000aif you get there early, you'll get better service from the waiters since they won't be as overwhelmed in the beginning.  the food at the buffet bar will be fresher since all the food is made once and when it's out it's out.  get there too late and all the best foods are gone (i missed out on their stuffed grape leaves and green beans today).  also, if you get there early you'll get your own table, but if you get there later you might have to share a table with other patrons.  today we ended up sitting at a table with three other parties, which is kinda cool but also kinda awkward at the same time.\u000a\u000ai think zenith's the kinda place that not everyone will be able to appreciate, but for those who do, they absolutely love it.

V$10 never tasted so damn delicious. say what you will about vegetarian/ vegan fare, i'm pretty sure the most carnivorous of carnivores would leave zeniths sunday brunch satisfied. yep, 10 bucks will get you 1 entree (you pick from 5 or 6 choices) that comes with 2 sides. next choose your drink- coffee or tea (hot or iced) then get your ass up to the buffet table where cakes, breads, fresh fruit and salads a plenty await you. \u000a\u000aarrive early to get a table or put your name in and browse around the antique shop until a table opens up.

Vmy new favorite brunch spot in the 'burgh!  it's all vegetarian, and sooo good.  definitely worth waiting in the line that forms before this place opens up on sunday.\u000a\u000ayou pick an entree, usually there are french toast and scramble options--last time i went, there was even a bbq seitan sandwich.  i went with lemon artichoke stew, which was heavenly.  there are also different herbal teas, juices, and coffee to choose as a beverage.\u000a\u000athe best part is the buffet line--close to 30 different salads (veggie, pasta, and fruit) to choose from and a whole table full of pies and cakes. \u000a\u000athe dishes are fiestaware and different antique pitchers and glasses from the zenith's antique store.  the atmosphere is cute and kitschy, and you can buy any of the art on the walls.\u000a\u000ai will definitely be back for brunch on future sundays, i might even try lunch or dinner here as well.  the zenith is a great little place!

Vwhy haven't more people reviewed this place?  is it because it's a mixture of two things we are taught to be bad for us at different ages?  is it because the building looks ominous as you walk towards it.  or is it because people are too lazy to discover this place?  whatever the reason, shame people, shame.\u000a\u000ai've never really paid attention while i was in here much, except for today.  as i looked around my eyes widened.  i was...a kid in a candy store!  literally.  candy, candy everywhere.  candy that will take you back to your childhood and maybe even further than that.  i definitely practiced good self control in here, or else i would have been broke by the time i walked out the door.\u000a\u000ayes, i admit, i also ventured back to the "adult" section.  selection is vast.  prices are some of the best, even better than the local corner market or gas station.  staff were rather fun to deal with.  joking and talking in there raspy voices.  i'll definitely know i will be stopping back in here when i'm in the area.

Vthere's something scary about going through a drive-thru that's dark.  come around the bend from ordering at the sign and you may think you are about to be the first victim in a new horror flick.  the bushes are overgrown, weeds popping up around them.  then you pull around and see you have to go through a dark tunnel.\u000a\u000aa dim light flickers overhead, you hear the hum of your car engine and smell the exhaust.  you pull up to the rickety window and as it opens you almost expect an axe wielding murderer to be on the other side.  you silently pay for your food in fear that you may say the wrong thing to bring on the wrath of the employee.\u000a\u000aas you quietly pull away, you think you're almost free until you hear the *ding ding* of the bell that reminds you of pulling up to the gas pumps.  as you pull back into the light of daylight you think to yourself, 'i survived!'\u000a\u000awell almost, that is until you discover now you have to dodge pedestrians on the sidewalk and then pray to god that you can get back onto carson st.  good luck with that.\u000a\u000ai wouldn't step foot in this place.  yes, it looks all nostalgic from the outside, but once you get inside it just looks rundown.\u000a\u000aas far as burger king goes, take the time to go elsewhere.

Vthis salvation army definitely has its fans. i've known people that would salivate at the idea of a saturday afternoon spent digging through this store. you can, occasionally, find some good stuff here, but it takes a lot of digging and perseverance, and i find the price point to be way past my thrift flinch point, usually. \u000a\u000athere are two levels. the lower level is furniture, housewares, linens, books, and toys. basically, everything they carry besides clothing. the organization here on this level is..... well, "organization" is such a strong word. let's just say that the sections are free spirits that are not limited by arbitrary"categories" for your ease. most everything is pretty dirty. you can find ebay-worthy stuff sometimes, but i just don't ever feel like it's worth my time. \u000a\u000aupstairs, you will find a cram-packed clothing section. men's, women's, children's, purses, jackets, coats and shoes stuff each rack to the bursting point and then there are the wall displays -- "selected items" are hung on nails, all the way up to the ceiling. yes, you have to ask for help to get stuff down. \u000a\u000athere's a decent mix of old and newer stuff, but i rarely, rarely find things i want to buy. i think a lot of the merch is overpicked regularly by some savvy shoppers on the southside. i definitely feel like this location is supported by a captive population. \u000a\u000aof the few items i have purchased here, many of them had mystery stains or holes i didn't notice before i bought them, sadly. this is the thrift store in pgh i am most likely to leave completely empty handed (a special feat, one that i perform only rarely).

Vi've been in a thrifting mood lately and of course couldn't pass up this location.  it's not really bigger than other locations, but it's definitely a place to come and look around to see what is there.  they seem to pack as much stuff in here as humanly possible.\u000a\u000ai was on a mission to find an awful picture with a pretty good frame in order to do a project i have on my mind.  so i had stopped at several other local thrift shops and had no luck.  i should note here that i had no luck at this location as well.  but i didn't walk out of here empty handed.  \u000a\u000ai ended up purchasing a pretty awesome drop leaf table.  fits perfectly in my apartment.  the staff here are super polite, they even helped me out to my car after my purchase.\u000a\u000aof course like any other thrift store, steer clear on senior citizen day.  no one wants an old lady beat down.

Vim not going to repeat what the other reviewers have said so just go and experience it for yourself.  its a fabulous little shop and the employees are cheerful and grounded, not cranky or snobby. however you define yourself, you'll find something special.

Vthis place is kind of an amazing place.  it's like a magical portal to view yourself through a different look.  granted, the clothes are for women, but i'm fairly sure if you are a guy like myself, you can find something for you as well.\u000a\u000aaside from the clothing they have rugs, blankets, jewelry, journals, scarfs, and the list could go on and on here.  heck, i even saw some hacky sacks...that takes me back to my teen years.  \u000a\u000athe staff are easy to approach and very knowledgeable about the products they have for purchase here.  i was intrigued by the wood earrings they had for gaged ears.  time definitely could be lost while browsing through this store.  before we knew it the sun was starting to set outside.

Vi was here once, two years ago. i had high hopes because my bff's partner raved about it and because its like halloween everyday. unfortunately is was lame, lame, lame. parking is beyond aggravating and it looks like the dollar tree threw up in there.

Vi'm in love with this bar.  anyplace that can incorporate halloween into the decor and sustain it 365 days a year gets my vote.\u000a\u000athe drinks all have ghoulish names and no two are the same.  depending on their inventory the cups or straws are halloween themed too.  last time i was there, i got one of those spider rings usually out on halloween and wore it for the remainder of the night.  no one had to ask if i was at jeckyll & hyde with that piece on.\u000a\u000aif you don't like halloween, stop sniveling.

Vonly good for people watching. \u000a\u000afood is overly greasy, i know its a diner but i don't think grease is supposed to ooze out of my spinach pie when i stick a fork in it.\u000a\u000adon't use the bathrooms on the weekends...im sure its overflowing with stuff (i was going to go into detail but thought better of it).\u000a\u000ago to the toms in dormont if you're looking for a seminormal latenite meal.

Vfor the period of time i wasn't a resident of the city and decided that i wanted to do a bar crawl on the south side i opted to get a room here.  best decision of my life at that point.\u000a\u000aparking is provided behind the hotel and only $14 extra.  come and go as you please while you are there.  three of us stayed in the room and with two beds and a pull out sofa it was a nice choice.  no sharing of beds for us.  \u000a\u000awithin walking distance to everything on the south side made it easy to basically leave everything but cash and id in the room and venture out.  it was a party weekend in the burgh so even after the bars closed there seemed to be an after party in the hotel itself.  \u000a\u000apool and fitness center within the building with a restaurant on the ground floor.  so if you didn't want to go anywhere while there you didn't have to.  great location too if you wanted to head downtown, just go across the 10th street bridge and you are basically in the downtown area.

Vthe unwanted step-child of the giant eagle stores.\u000a\u000aif the rumors are true about competition moving into the south side maybe they'll do a nice remodel of this place and add some space.  \u000a\u000aif it weren't for the awful placement of the bus stop that seems to draw some trashy people and the constant blaring of music from people showing off their cars in the parking lot, it might actually feel a lot safer to walk to and from the store.  \u000a\u000afor such a prime area as the south side, it's such an odd location to have a plaza with stores in it.  it's like no one were to see these store and it just got pushed back out of sight from carson st.  fells other worldly.  one thing i don't miss since i don't live in the south side anymore.

Voh yes, the beehive.  the bohemian buzz!\u000a\u000aas an above yelp'er pointed out, this was the place to be in high school during the height of grunge!  i was never really a drinker because of my diabetes, but i could always have coffee.  i used to love to come here with friends, hang out, play a board game or two.  even as we reached drinking age, my friends were pretty cool about me not being able to drink, so we'd still come here on occasion (but really, i'm okay with having a diet coke at a bar!).\u000a\u000aas i've gotten older, i've drifted away from this place.  but every so often, when i'm in the area, the need for a bohemian buzz comes back.  sometime soon, my husband and i will have to come in the evening and just hang out here.

Voh the beehive!  oh, the "bohemian buzz".  after going to the show at the nearby southside works cinema, the girl posse and i stopped here afterwards.  this place (well really its oakland location moreso) was a staple for me back in the '90s when i was in high school and college.  all the memories came back as we sat down--hanging out with friends, drinking coffee or espresso into the wee hours of the morning, playing boardgames, the mix-matched decor etc.  some things never change.\u000a\u000athey may not exactly change, but let's just say they modify.  some members of the posse have kids (thus we had to leave by 11pm), susan just can't drink caffienated coffee at night anymore.  she prefers her sleep now and besides, she and her husband were taking the niece and nephew to idlewild park the next day.\u000a\u000abut you know what?  the four of us still had a great time last night.  i mentioned board games.  so you think we started off with trivial persuit?  scrabble?  monopoly?  nah, we found candyland floating around.  so picture four married 30-something gals drinking decaf (well, actually marla is one of those who can drink a double espresso or a huge regular coffee and go to bed an hour later) and reliving their childhoods.  we did find a scrabble game after that though.  \u000a\u000ai do miss the oakland location though.  i remember seeing the movie "clerks" there (how '90s of me) and quite a few bands there too.  too bad it's now a t-mobile store, or something like that.

Vtime for another update.  i went to the movies at the manor with three of my girlfriends last night.  two of them have kids and had to go home afterwards, but sherry and i were still up for something else.  and with all the great coffeehouses right by the manor, naturally we trekked down to the beehive!  it's still a cool place as ever and we got an intense game of candyland up!

Vmy review is based solely upon getting food to go. \u000a\u000aon my lunch breaks, ill walk to the beehive and grab some grub. so far nothing has disappointed me. i've tasted several soups, i'm a huge fan of the carrot/poppyseed and their minestrone. sandwiches and wraps are always fresh, healthy and delicious. \u000a\u000aprices are fair and the establishment is cash only. they do have an atm inside but a couple of times i've been there and it was out of order so make sure you've some money in your wallet before you go.

V*this review is for the oakland location only*\u000a\u000aevery couple of years i get the itch for some ink though i have an artist i am really happy with i wanted to expand my horizons a bit so i decided to check out jesters court in oakland (a friend of mine has had some work done by michael patrick at the south side location and his work is really great so i thought okay, i'll check this place out)\u000a\u000ai went to have an owl drawn up so i took a necklace in for a bit of reference, the guy photo copied it, gave me his card and told me to call the next day so that is what i did. he said he had some ideas when can i come in, i replied that i worked today but had the next 2 days completely free. he asked if i could do it hat day, i said sure i'll be down at 6 when i take my break. i walked down the hill, made it there by 6:04 only to find a sign that said "be back in 10" i waited 25 and left. \u000a\u000ai lost my break and my $20 deposit but that's okay, lesson learned. i will never stray again!

Vi guess i'm a little like darren w.  i love cds and books too.  i don't think there's anything wrong with ipods or ipads, etc.  but ya know what?  i'm old fashioned that way.  i actually like having a comprehensive music collection.  i like to actually sit and listen to a cd.  i like to have it in my hands to hold.  besides what good is your itunes collection if something crashes?  \u000a\u000awell with that in mind, i have over 300 cds in my collection, spanning alternative, grunge, folk/americana, country & western, new wave/80s, and classic rock.  and in the past ten years or so, you know how many i've bought new?  almost zero!  yeah, i've bought some from amazon, but i love going to places like this and just simply browsing.  \u000a\u000aso yesterday my friend marla, my cousin cindy, and i wandered down to carson street.  i can't speak for the other two babes, but i didn't know exactly what i was looking for.   but isn't that the great thing about used cd buying or vintage clothes shopping?  and you know something?  you can't get that joy of finding a rare import on your mp3 player!\u000a\u000ai found "here comes the new folk underground" by david baerwald.  now as you musicphiles know, david baerwald was 1/2 of the famous 80s one-hit-wonder david & david.  (david & david's hit was one of my favorite songs, "welcome to the boomtown").  i also found "train a comin" by steve earle, another one of my favorite artists.  and in a shout-out to a certain yelp yes fan from the chicago area, i bought "90125" from yes.  cindy bought "yes songs".  marla played it a little safer with a doobie brothers "greatest hits" collection.\u000a\u000athis is a great place for a music fan.   downloading should never replace the true joy of music shopping.  oh yeah, they also sell concert tix here for local venues like club cafe.

Vdave's music mine is kind of like a lost playground for the older generation and a discovery zone for the younger generation.  it is truly a one of a kind place for the city of pittsburgh to have.  \u000a\u000ait sits inside an unassuming building on the south side that most people walk by on a daily basis.  me, i walk in here every time i visit the area.  you walk in and it just looks like somebody's cluttered storage unit.  packed to the brim with music of every format.  every genre, every decade, every format is represented here.  you want something; i'm going to say that 99.9% of the time they got it.  if it falls into the .01%, i am fairly sure that they would gladly take the time to track down what you are looking for.  \u000a\u000amusic of all varieties show up here daily i am sure.  you can browse the new selection or look through what someone else might consider to be dated and just taboo for them to have in their collection anymore.  you can find that cd you lost years ago and reclaim the memories attached to that favorite song.  \u000a\u000alooking for something to play on your turntable, take an adventure downstairs deeper into the depth of the store to browse through the multitudes of vinyl they have to offer.  this is where the old becomes the new and i'd like to think how the 'mine' in the name comes into play.  still have a cassette player in the heavy old stereo system you have at home, not to worry, there's a section for you.\u000a\u000ai have lost myself and hours in here browsing through the selection of tastes.  reminiscing how i first heard a song and connecting to a moment in my life that makes me happy.\u000a\u000aas i walk away from this place i then wonder how i lost those thoughts in the first place.  what i don't worry about is the missing money from my pocket.  only because i know it just bought me back my memories and supported a great local business.

Vi hit up cafe du jour this past friday as part of a series of a weekend of dining out.\u000a\u000ai went in the early afternoon and avoided the lunchtime rush (if there was a rush) and we grabbed seats in the backyard patio.  i ended up ordering pork chops.\u000a\u000athe thick cut pork chop was a lot larger than i anticipated.  it came with a halved roasted yukon gold potato and a side of a spring green salad.  the pork had a beautiful char on the outside and was ridiculously juicy and tender.  i usually steer clear of pork due to my fear of dryness and lack of flavor, but this pork chop delivered and i'd order them again.  the potatoes were perfectly roasted; i've never had such perfectly roasted potatoes before (i always find them slightly undercooked or excessively overcooked).  the salad was pretty standard.\u000a\u000ai also tried their mushroom consomm and a piece of their shrimp crepes.  the mushroom consomm was delicious and recommendable.  the shrimp crepes were good too, but are slightly overpriced for what they are.  they're delicious, but the portion is pretty small and serves more as an appetizer, but they are at the entree price point.\u000a\u000aif you have a chance to hit it up, sit outside.  there's a small fountain and two turtles that swim around in it, and the ivy on the brick walls makes you forget you're dining out in pittsburgh.

Vi returned to cafe du jour for dinner last night after a great lunch last friday and even though it's hard to believe, it got even better.\u000a\u000awe started with a spinach and asiago dip that came with piping hot bread.  the bread wasn't spectacular but it served its purpose of being a vessel of transferring the creamy cheesy dip to our mouths.  words cannot describe the feeling of bliss i experienced after my first bite.  it's easily the best appetizer i've had in months.\u000a\u000ai also tried their soup du jour, which was a hearty tomato base soup with vegetables and white beans topped with just a small kiss of cheese.  the cheese melted fantastically into the soup and each creamy spoonful of love filled my body with a feeling of fulfillment.\u000a\u000afor entrees i ordered their pan-seared scallops which came with a couscous.  i've realized whenever i order an entree where scallops are the main player, they always come out underwhelming in quantity.  my dish came with four beautiful seared sea scallops and a small mound of couscous in the middle.  the scallops were delicious, but if i hadn't had an appetizer and soup beforehand, my stomach would have been left unsatisfied.  one incredible dish i will order next time is their chevre stuffed roast chicken, which comes with a cauliflower puree.  the waiter recommended it and noted that the description of the dish on the menu doesn't do it justice.\u000a\u000atips/hints:\u000a1. sit in the backyard patio.  it is beautiful and quiet and definitely a good date spot.\u000a2. it is byob, so take advantage of it.\u000a3. cash only!  so make sure you hit the atm beforehand.\u000a4. you can order off the lunch menu if you want their sandwiches for dinner.\u000a5. go in a smaller party.  i'd say no more than 4.  it's a small place and the kitchen isn't that big.\u000a5. you can and should call ahead for reservations.  they'll know to expect you.  (i've never had to wait, but it's better to be safe right?)\u000a6. you must order their spinach and asiago dip.\u000a\u000acheers!

Vi feel bad about giving this place 3 stars, and it's probably closer to a 3.5 (damn you yelp for not allowing me to provide more nuanced ratings!).  but the reality is, it's a place that i thought was fine, would be happy to go back to, but probably not go out of my way to go back to and probably would not be somewhere i personally would propose.  that is, i would go there if someone else suggested it, but i probably wouldn't suggest it myself.\u000a\u000aservice here is very nice - they aren't stuffy and it seems more like a neighborhood place than an outright restaurant.  closest comparison point might be girasole in shadyside in terms of ambiance.  alas, also in terms of noise level - this place can get loud, even when it's not particularly full.  it's also definitely got a neighborhood feel - when i walked in, there was a group of older women who were congregating for some sort of get together, and a family with a young child.  that is to say, other than the kid, my friend and i were probably the youngest people there for a long while.  i think the young professionals didn't start showing up until around 8:30ish.  i don't mean to say this in a evaluative way - it's just information for you to get a sense of who goes there and when.\u000a\u000athe food was somewhat hit or miss.  the spinach and cheese dip was delicious, and i will say that the shrimp small plate was divine.  perfectly cooked shrimp on rosemary skewers in a tomato based sauce with buttered crusty bread... absolutely awesome.  but the pork crostini with brie was not my favorite - the pork was tasteless and somewhat dry.  my friend had the mushroom soup and a house salad, neither of which seemed particularly inspired.\u000a\u000aperhaps we went wrong by not ordering one of the main entrees.  so, i grant you that perhaps we should give it another try.  but, given my aversion to the south side, a place has to be pretty amazing for me to brave the traffic and craziness of carson st., and this didn't cut it.  but, i don't regret having tried it.

V"where to find the best belgian beer bar in north america".  well, i can't comment on that because i'm a non-drinker.  i was out in crafton doing a site visit for work and thought i'd stop in here for some lunch.  i have to say i love the building this place is in.  it does look like an old creekhouse.  i've been by this place before and i'm pretty sure it's been other things.  \u000a\u000aso i sat myself down, opened the menu, and --yow!-- the prices here are a little steeper than i thought they might be!  oh well, it was getting past lunchtime and susan's tummy was talking to her!  i was looking at the appetizers and i saw the belgian pomme frites.  yikes!  that thing probably could feed five.  i was also thinking about some soup and i noticed the hop devil potato.  "creamy cheddar cheese soup spiked with victory hop devil (whatever that is), loaded with tender potatoes and served in a sourdough bread bowl."  that's not just soup, that's a meal!  for two, it seems!  \u000a\u000aso i went for the rueben, figuring that wouldn't be so ginormous and even if it was, i could get half to go.  it didn't disappoint and i did end up taking half of it with me.  my sandwich was good though.  i give sharp edge a solid three stars because:\u000a\u000apro:  excellent atmosphere in a pretty building.\u000asemi pro:  food is good, but it's typical bar fare.\u000acon:  kind of pricey.

Vvery good lunch prices.  two of us ate for $14.40 before tip.  lunches come with either wonton or lemongrass soup and a spring roll.  the lemongrass soup was very spicy with chunks of tomato and mushroom.  i was expecting something more mild, like tom yum, but i really enjoyed the soup.  the spring rolls were just big enough for two bites.  i ordered the moarn chha kroeung, a dish of mixed vegetables in a thick yellow lemongrass sauce.  it was delicious and i'm having a hard time thinking of a similar, comparable dish.  my roommate got the moarn chha ktom, which he also liked.\u000a\u000alunches come with your choice of veggies/tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp and are priced with the veggies being the cheapest and shrimp being the most expensive (at $7.95 - hardly expensive).\u000a\u000aservice was just ok - they didn't offer dessert and kind of walked away before we could place drink orders, but our food came out very quickly and water was refilled promptly.\u000a\u000ai would definitely return if i'm in this part of town again.  if you go, order one of the cambodian dishes and try something new.

Vi have been to angkor more than 30 times, and i have never been dissapointed.  the food is unusual, delicious and very satisfying.  i particularly recommend the cambodian dishes, that is angkor's strength.  i like the wood carving, the orchids in the front window, i am very much charmed by the decor.  the service has always been excellent for me, it is very attentive, helpful, service.  i like that there is no corkage fee.  the lunch menu is more limited than the dinner menu, make sure you go there for dinner.

Vi first noticed this place on my run, then i came across it in a pittsburgh traveling guide and finally, some 5 months later, i had an opportunity to visit yesterday. it's in a part of greenfield called the run, tucked away from main roads and traffic. parking is super easy, the neighborhood looks a little sketch but i've ran here at night in the dark and it seems fine.\u000a\u000athe restaurant was packed! for this location, i thought it would be pretty empty. lots of families, relaxing and enjoying their huge dinners. we were seated right away, with people constantly checking up on us, right away we got beer and menus. i'd say we had 3 waiters as all of them made sure everything was great. \u000a\u000athe food is home-style, comfort food - lots of hoagies, sandwiches and pasta, they have their menu online. i ordered a 2-bill sandwich: corned beef, swiss cheese, slaw and a fried egg. it was huge and came with more coleslaw. it sounds like they only have 4 beers on tap.\u000a\u000ahighlight of my meal - noticing diners, drive-ins and dives poster on a wall, autographed. i'm not a huge fan of the show but still thought it pretty cool to eat at a place featured on food network's show!

Vi love big jim's! the staff are always personable and the food is always fantastic! everything is made to order; pizzas, stromboli, and calzones take about 30 minutes (be patient, it's worth the wait). the portions are gigantic so you 'll be able to take something home for later. \u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i come here often; he is a creature of habit and always orders the 2 bill sandwich (a reuben plus a fried egg), i on the other hand like to switch things up. i've had the gardenburger (they'll ask what you want on it), the alfredo is amazing, eggplant parm is pretty standard but still delicious and a veggie stromboli (i could only eat half and i have a pretty healthy appetite). the french fries are thin and get cold fast so eat 'em first \u000a\u000athere is something for everyone to enjoy, even vegetarians!!

Vthis is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar. i went with friends on the recommendation of a food network host, and was not disappointed. the food is greasy, delicious, and comes in large portions.\u000a\u000anot to mention, it's cheap. be prepared to wait, though - it's a popular place!

Vone of my favorite things i've ever heard guy fieri say is "if you're from pittsburgh, you've heard of 'the run'". guy, i had not heard of the run, and i have yet to meet anyone that, prior to going to big jim's, has heard of the run either(except for my one friend's grandma). however, i'll not forget the run - a small stretch in greenfield near the south side works involving a baseball field that has housed this place since 1977 - after having come to big jim's.\u000a\u000abig jim's is full of cheap,largely-portioned food that i think is characteristic of this area. little flair, decent flavor, no funny business. enter and take your pick of the dining room or the bar area. there may be a wait(i've been here once or twice with a line out the door, mostly during games. go another time and you're good to sit just about anywhere). the crowd is a good mix - neighbors, locals, pitt students. the menu is a selection of mostly fried appetizers, sandwiches, hoagies, some italian specialties, and pizza. \u000a\u000amy favorite item to get here is definitely the veggie hoagie. so simple: good bread, provalone cheese, brocolli, cauliflower, onions, peppers, carrots, thrown in the oven until the veggies are roasted(add mayo for me, of course... and sometimes a little ketchup :). this thing tastes amazing, and while i could probably down a full one, i prefer to share it with a side of some kind of appetizer. the spaghetti here is also pretty good, and i've had the eggplant parmesian and it was decent. the entrees will net you garlic bread and spaghetti and a salad, large portions of everything, so don't attempt them alone.\u000a\u000anow all that being said, i do have a few gripes about this place - number one being that the service is slow. my order usually takes about 20-30 minutes to come back to me, which for a hoagie is kind of crazy in my opinion. the staff is friendly and it's hard to get upset, just don't come here for a 'quick' bite. my other gripe is that while some of the menu is definitely home cookin', other parts of the menu are definitely not, so buyer beware. my girlfriend ordered the applesauce once($1.50) and about 15 minutes later(but well before the rest of our food came) the waitress handed her a generic plastic cup of applesauce, not even opened. i mean come on, at least put the stuff in a dish.\u000a\u000abut what are you gonna do. the veggie hoagie is too good to pass up. just accept the stuff for what it is, and don't try and go on the edge of this place's comfort zone. stick to what they do best and you won't be disappointed.

Vi went here expecting the worst, and was pleasantly surprised - the place is funky. expect huge portions of cheap, fairly good although on the greasy side... food. bring your apetite! the calzone is big enough to feed four for dinner, easily. salad was okay, and the salmon sandwich was better than expected (but not great). next time i crave some hearty food, i'll probably come back and get a pizza or calzone.

V*walks in, sets down soapbox, steps upon soapbox, clears throat*  for all those people that kindly wrote a review on this place solely because you watched an episode of ddd, maybe you should have ordered exactly what was shown on the show and then left it at that.  if you are going to come here because of the show, then do exactly what they did on the show and leave it at that.  don't bring down the whole place because what you ordered didn't look/taste like what was served on the show.  *steps down and removes the soapbox*\u000a\u000anow, since that is out of the way, let me move forward.\u000a\u000ayes, this place is a little offsetting with the way it looks.  it's a bit divey on the inside, well maybe more than a bit divey on the inside.  that is exactly what gives this place character.  it gives you the feel that you are in someones home from the 70s.  tvs are around the place, tacky pictures and mirrors line the walls, and the chairs are mismatched.  the servers kind of blend in a bit making it feel 70s more so.  \u000a\u000athe menu, even though it looks small, takes a bit to look over.  be sure to look it over as well, you may pass up something that you really want.  i opted for the open face turkey sandwich with fries.  i was expecting to get a moderate amount of food as you do at other places, and i was fine by that.  what i got on the other hand surely surprised me.  when i saw the size of the plate, i was shocked.  it was the size of a small platter, and the whole thing was covered in food.  two thick slices of bread, toasted and then topped with a heaping pile of turkey and then covered with gravy.  and the fries, oh my god, the fries.  they are fresh cut, on the smaller size, but still amazing.  the gravy also topped these.  it took me some time and determination, but i downed it all.\u000a\u000afor two meals, it cost us under $20.  a meal of this caliber at any other place would definitely cost us more.  big jim's is definitely worth getting lost in greenfield to find a good meal.\u000a\u000a*take out available with a fee.

Vi give this giant eagle three solid stars for a rating.  hey, it's a chain grocery store--who gets excited about those.  this store has a pretty good selection of produce that is usually fresh.  i'll shop here if i am in the area and need something on the way home.\u000a\u000abut this was the giant eagle of my 20s, my single days.  it's where i first did grocery shopping on my own, for me and no one else.  it's where i learned the value of comparative shopping (because i was paying rent by that time) and where i learned to worship the double coupon.

Vthis giant eagle gets two stars because their customer service stinks. went to get some food, they have the club card/perks card like at safeway except that you can't get it! after waiting for 15 minutes and filling out the forms, i was told they were out of cards. and you can't get the card at a check out, you have to go to front desk. blah!

Vif i have to shop at any giant eagle in my area, it would be this one. the sq. hill location has more offerings but the employees all hate their lives and are either flirting with each other, on their phones, conversing with another employee, or just effin rude. the employees at the greenfield location are so much more personable and helpful.

Vi was in the neighborhood and i had to pick up a few items, so i thought i'd stop here instead of the one in my nieghborhood.  i used to come here back in my 20s (when i was single) and i don't think it's changed a bit.  it's a smaller neighborhood giant eagle, but it's got most of your basics here including bakery, dairy, deli, floral, and pharmacy.  \u000a\u000aits selections are just as good as the one in squirrel hill and it isn't as crazy crowded as the one in east liberty/shadyside.

Vit's the same squirrel hill deal but in greenfield.  cramped for space, dirty at times....i should know better than to expect there to be a market district in every neighborhood.  that being said, i only ever really run in here if i have to pick a quick something up and that's it.  definitely won't be doing my day to day grocery shopping here.

Vit's too bad that yelp doesn't allow for half-stars.  i would give rialto's pizza 3 1/2 stars if i could.  rialto's still ain't a bad place.  the pizza here is actually decent.  they do have some interesting specialty pizzas here, including a steak pizza, which is\u000asteak, sauteed onions, mushrooms, and green peppers topped with provolone and mozzarella cheeses and banana peppers.  they also have a cheeseburger pizza, which is pretty much as its name implies, except without a bun.\u000a\u000aif you're not in the mood for pizza, they do have baked ziti and spaghetti dishes, but i don't recommend these.  oh, they're not bad or anything, just not worth going out of your way for.  for desserts, they have italian donuts, cheesecake and ice cream.

Vwe ordered rialto's for pickup last friday, not wanting to bother with cooking after a long work week.  the prices are about what you'd expect, but if you can get your hands on a coupon or a code from allmenus, then it becomes super cheap - we got a large pizza from $8 due to a coupon code.  so look into that!\u000a\u000ait was ready when they said it would be, and we brought it back to our apartment, ready to dig in.  we'd ordered a large "rialto house" pizza, which is under the specialty part of the menu.  we opened the box to discover a mass of fresh toppings - pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and olives.  after a quick warming-up in the oven, we dug in.\u000a\u000ai have to say, the toppings really make this pizza.  sure, there's sauce and cheese under there, but neither to excess.  the toppings, however, are plentiful and high quality.  the peppers were fresh and crisp - i even enjoyed the mushrooms which i usually loathe.  and they weren't stingy about piling them on - nothing is worse than paying a lot for a pizza and then having to hunt for the few lonely pepperoni slices.  you pay for toppings, you should get a bunch of them.  the pizza wasn't oily or greasy either.\u000a\u000awe really enjoyed this pie, and would definitely order again.  i think if you're in the mood for greasy, cheesy goodness (which we are, from time to time), this is not the place.  but if you want a fresh pizza loaded with toppings and not loaded with grease, i'd recommend rialto!

Von second thought,  rialto's is pretty decent. this time around we got a specialty pie with 5 cheeses and tomatoes. the crust was good and so was the pie but the dough underneath the toppings doesn't hold up so well. its very flimsy and difficult to eat so i used a fork and knife. \u000a\u000ato sum it up...messy but tasty

Vtime to do another update.  i hadn't ordered from rialto in a few years, but i was doing something last night i hadn't done in awhile.  babysitting.  long story.  but i knew my friends' son likes cheese pizza so i picked one up for us and i figured rialto would be the best bet.  not fancy.  not great but not horrible either.  translation:  something a five-year-old would like.

Vthis was definitely one of the most unique dining experiences i've had - it's more like going over to someone's house for a dinner party who loves to cook rather than going to a restaurant. the proprietor, alex, is very friendly and talkative and introduces himself upon your arrival. the food is whatever he has decided to prepare for you and comes out in multiple courses served family style. there's definitely more food than can be consumed reasonably, so make sure to save room during the earlier courses for the later courses. at the end, he will provide containers to take leftovers home.\u000a\u000aas this was my first experience with hungarian food, i wasn't sure what to expect, so i was pleased that i enjoyed all of the dishes! the restaurant doesn't hold standard hours, so you need to call ahead to make a reservation. when you call, you can provide dietary restrictions, e.g. indicating that you would prefer vegetarian versions of the dishes. if you enjoy wine with dinner, make sure to byob. there is no corkage fee. \u000a\u000amy only minor complaint with the setup is the waste of styrofoam dishes and plastic utensils, and the fact that it's not as nice to eat with them as compared to real dishes/utensils. also, just set your expectations properly, don't expect a fancy set up. this is akin to eating in someone's house.

Vi took my cat to the walk-in clinic, there was a reasonable wait to see the vet which was understandable considering i didn't have an appointment. the staff were all very friendly and dr. o (please fogive me, i dont remember how to spell his last name so i'll just shorten it to dr. o) took the time to explain what was worng with murray, what medicine he was prescribing and what it was for. my bill was just over $100 which i expected to be more. i was very satisfied with the care murray received and would take him back in a heartbeat as well as recommend this place to any pet owner.

Vever think back to your early 20s?  you know, when you were single and had your first apartment?  when you did your own budgeting and your own grocery shopping for the first time?  ever look back at the neighborhood you lived in & the places you went?  \u000a\u000ame, i lived in greenfield from the time i was 23 up 'til i got married at age 27.  i used to satisfy my pizza cravings here and i remember it being great pizza at an absolutely hole-in-the-wall place.  i'm proud to say, it hasn't changed a bit. rick and i just wanted some takeout for dinner and since i was looking back at some of my old reviews, i thought we'd check out conicella once again.\u000a\u000am-m-m-m!  greasy, yummy, bad-for-you pizza!  we ordered the white pizza with sausage, hot peppers & mushrooms on it.  terrific!  especially if you're like me and you fold your slice as you eat it.  i know my chicago friends are cringing at the thought of eating it that way!

Vhad my brakes and rotors replaced here, so far so good. no wait, just walked in and talked to one of the guys - got my car back 2 hours later. friendly service and personable, he explained everything to me and showed what he was replacing and what was wrong. and i didn't have to wait for shuttle home, the guy who was helping gave me a ride home and later picked me up in my newly repaired car!

Vthanks to snomageddon 2010, i had to pay a visit to a body shop to fix a dented front bumper and fender after crashing into a guard rail on mt. washington. i now know why there are always two listings for pon's. downstairs is the mechanic and upstairs is the body shop, they're two different businesses but i guess the owners are brothers or something along those lines. \u000a\u000aas with the auto shop, i didn't need to schedule an appointment, called and they told me to come in anytime (i guess with the snow storm a lot of their appointments got cancelled) turned my car in on tuesday, got it back same week thursday with a brand new fender, headlight and a fixed up shiny front bumper. the price was more than reasonable and i'm happy to find a place where i can take my car, get outstanding service and not worry about being charged extra.

Vthe food is just as good here (or better) than the other pamela's.  there is sometimes a line, but it moves quickly.  the restaurant is located in a old fashioned pharmacy.  love the crepe pancakes and the home fried potatoes.  this is a cash only restaurant, but there is an atm located in the pharmacy.  jean-marc chatellier's french bakery is across the street, and that's always worth a visit.

Vso i finally gave in to moving around before 2pm on a saturday to come see jean-marc and taste his baked goods. i was running low on excuses, since a round trip takes me all of 20 minutes to make. the place is highly unassuming on north street, a small strip of stores in millvale that very, er, rustic - with a simple red-white-and-blue sign announcing it's presence. \u000a\u000athe inside of this place is tiny, where the customers are, anyways. two pastry cases - one on the left has pastries, cake slices, mini pies, and more - most of them being $3.50(except for these large, beautiful penguins with are $5). the one inside the door has all of your bread-pastries(croissants, brioche), ladylocks, cupcakes, etc(most of these are around $2 i think), and to the right there are the full pies($8 and up), cakes, and the macarons. samples of cakes, breton, and other items are strewn about the store.\u000a\u000abeing it's a french bakery, the macarons were a given. you can get them individually for $1.35 or so, a half dozen for $8, and a full dozen for about $15. in my two trips here, i've tried quite a few, and they're all outstanding, but of note are the two floral flavors, rose raspberry and poppy lavender. my girlfriend is a floral fanatic, and had to try. usually upset at the flavors not matching the description, there was no disconnect here. the rose(a flavor i'm usually not fond of) tastes like chewing rose petals in the best way possible, and the lavender is much the same, tasting strong of its aroma. the fruit flavors are also very nice and the their texture is out of this world: crisp, a bit chewy, and filled with ganache.\u000a\u000athe brioches are wonderful, the cheese being the favorite i had so far, super soft and tasting slightly eggy(in a good way). we've also tried some of the pastries. the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is excellent, with a layer of chocolate on top and a highly spiced crust. also the st. honore, a giant puff pastry with whipped cream, strawberries, and just a dot of delicious caramel on top, was outstanding. next time i go, i have my eyes on the beautiful apple tarts, and the amazing looking cappuccino tiramisu.\u000a\u000ajean-marc's is a fabulous bakery, and its proximity to attic records should be a no-brainer to convince you to make a quick trip to millvale on a saturday morning. come early, because the selection was notably smaller when we came at 1pm. also, the meters on the street take dimes, and are $0.25 for an hour.

Vmost bakeries will have one or two things that are amazing, and then a bunch of mediocre stuff that they don't sell a lot of but that fills their cases.  at jean marc's, every single thing i've ever tried has been amazing.\u000a\u000athe macarons, the cakes, the shortbread...seriously, it's the best.  my favorite thing here are the salted caramel macarons, but i can't emphasize enough that everything is good!  \u000a\u000athe girls at the counter are always friendly, and there are usually samples of different baked goods out as well.  definitely give it a try!!

Vsince i wrote about the the monongahela incline yesterday, i thought i'd give the duquesne incline equal time.  it's not as conveniently located for me, so i've made far fewer trips on this one.  unlike the mon incline, it doesn't connect with the rail system.  it does, however, connect with several bus routes going between downtown and the west end at its lower station.  there's also a large parking lot at the lower station.\u000a\u000aunlike the mon incline, whose cars are very austere looking, the duquesne's cars are very ornate.  they are still the original cars from 1877, made out of cherry-wood.  they really creak while en-route!  also unlike the mon incline, the duquesne incline is operated by a non-profit preservation society and receives no subsidies.  you can, however, use port authority transit passes and transfers on it (the society does get re-imbursed by pat for this).\u000a\u000aso here's a suggested itinerary.  park your car at the lower station.  ride up the duquense incline.  use the overlook.  then walk east on grandview avenue (beware, there are a couple of wicked hills).  stop at the overlooks near the mon incline, and head back down the mon incline.  you can then browse through station square and walk through their parking lot to get back to the duquesne incline.  or, you can do the reverse and begin at station square.  my now husband and i did so on one of our earliest dates.

Vi was here most often when i lived in mt. washington.  the scene is pretty twisted.  you've got some local thugs that may be visiting from allentown and you'll also have just  your regular types like me and other older locals. sometimes you'll see a few folks in suits.   the bartenders are pretty good most of the time.  they used to have one guy named dustin who had a pretty good record with beating the spread in football games.  the food is surprisingly good bar food.  i think their mozzarella sticks are the best i've had, and super healthy for you.  and, by healthy i mean not physically but mentally.  one last thing, it's neither a resort or a yacht club.

Vshiloh grill = harris grill. same decor, same hipster wait staff, same menu. that being said, the food is just as good and i was happy with the service. i brought friends here so they could see the view from mt. washington, and they were very pleased with the food. i would think that the patio would be what would really sell this when it's not as cold out. overall, this is where i would be going if i lived on the mt.

Vnot bad... if you're a fan of the harris grill, you'll probably like this. i had the bean cakes appetizer which was decent but not incredible, and the fish tacos. the fish tacos were, pittsburgh style, which means that they came in a flour tortilla, but the sauce was decent and the grilled fish was tasty. the side dish of green beans was unfortunately drenched in butter.\u000a\u000anice decor, decent beer on tap, but slightly noisy inside.

Vso, i find myself spending more and more time here lately since a friend recently moved into the apartments in the same building.  i've been going here for years and am definitely a a fan.  the valet parking is good, however a pet peeve is that you have to pay to valet.  i always think this should be complimentary with fine dining.  the elevator takes a fortnight to arrive to the top floor dining room is another small annoyance, but everything else is pretty close to five stars.  the main dining room is gorgeous with the best view of the burgh' or any city for that matter that you can have.  the hand painted palm trees are very nice and relaxing and the furniture is adequate.  they have plenty of space on the lower floor for big functions. i've had events in these big rooms for 50 to 100 folks multiple times.  however, a must visit is the wine room.  it is amazing.  you have three oak tables in a small room with wine bottles and floor to ceiling glass all around you.  ask for pat he is a great server and a true pro with respect to his craft.  he also always remembers me even though i haven't used the room for years.  they say the room seats 27 (3 tables of 9), but i don't suggest more than 24 in this space.  if you use this room you need at least 8 folks' and you have to choose one of the wine tasting menus.  they are $95 or $120 i believe for each 5 course wine tasting.  i suggest if you are going to use this room to splurge for the $120.  it's much better wine and includes a champagne toast.  this obviously is not a room i'd use often, but perfect for special occassions.  more and more i find myself simply sitting at the bar.  it has a great lounge and bar area, with plenty of seating.  if you find yourself in a bind to get a table in the dining room you can almost always find a table in the lounge with the same menu.  i've probably been here almost once a week the past couple months.  the bartenders are really good and definitely take care of there regulars.  as an aside, this place is also like the "melrose place" of pittsburgh with many single folks choosing to stay in this building which has the restaurant located on the top floor.  the food is pretty much the best fish in pittsburgh and less pricey than the some of the other fish joints like "original fish market".  my only complaint with the menu is that i wish they offered more shellfish options like crab and lobster and not just crab cakes (which btw are probably the best in the city, which is saying a lot for a town that loves crabcakes).   some recent menu highlights have been the oysters rockefeller. i'd say skip this.  it was super heavy with a thick hollandaise, too much cheese and breadcrumbs.  the "ahi" tempura was really great and i found to be somewhat of a paradox in that it's close to raw great quality fish, but they find a way to put a light breading on it and deep fry it without the fish being overcooked.  my new favorite menu item.  the ichiban is good which is just a skewer of medium rare fish.  i also found the filet to be of great quality and reasonablyu priced for a "prime": cut for $37 for 10 oz.  you literally can't go wrong with any fish dish you choose, i'll just offer a couple suggestions.  if you want something rich and deeply flavored try the swordfish parmasan style.  it's very rich, but soooo delicious.  if you prefer something lighter with a lot of flavor try the ahi tuna sashimi style.  it's fantastic.  the prices are reasonable, service is good, and it's the perfect spot for out of town guests.  definitely one of my pgh. favs'.

Vamazing views, but high prices considering the food quality; you're really paying for the view here, not the food. food wise, i've had better fish at umi and penn ave, fish company.\u000a\u000aservice was prompt and friendly, although the decor was surprisingly tacky - palm tree pillars? really? probably won't go back again unless someone is visiting from out of town who really wants to see the view.

Vgeorgetowne inn is a style, culinary and service abomination. located at the top of mt. washington, it is perfectly situated for beautiful, romantic meals that should highlight all the wonderful things about pittsburgh. instead, it plays into all the old stereotypes some have about pittsburgh and pittsburgh food scene. \u000a\u000aentrance: parking can be difficult on mt. washington on weekend nights, so we paid the $5 valet service fee. no biggie, right, because we're about to have a great meal. besides who wants to walk 5 blocks in dress clothes, because georgetowne inn is "dressy." oh, wait, it's actually not dressy. the hostess was wearing black stretch pants, and many patrons were wearing jeans, shorts, polo shirts, and tank or tube tops. yes, i saw someone in a tube top. after we check in with the hostess, she proceeds to bring us to one of the worst tables in the place. when we express dissatisfaction and ask for another table, she says we'll have to wait for a better table (despite many being open). but wait, i've had a reservation for 2 week now, doesn't that mean anything? silly jill, having a reservation doesn't actually mean anything! see, the good tables are first come, first serve-- duh!\u000a\u000adecor: oh, wow. don't get me wrong, there is a special place in my heart for restaurants that are old school. this place is just a joke. firstly, it's carpeted. gross. second, the interior looks remarkably similar to a steak n ale. is it the renaissance in here? why are there torturous-looking white spikes protruding from the walls and ceiling? how did you manage to get a toilet bowl that is peach with a white tank? these are things i cannot answer.\u000a\u000aordering: this is where the evening got really spectacular. after waiting for 5 full minutes (with no wine list), i ask the bread girl if she knew where our server was. five minutes later the server shows up. no greeting, no nothing, just, "can i get you something from the bar?" we tell her we have the living social deal that comes with wine. "oh, ok. well, you have a choice between a red and a white." jill: "sure. what are the grape varieties that we get to choose from?" server: "huh?" jill: "what types of red and white wines do we get to choose from? for example, a pinot noir or a pinot gris?" server: "oh, i don't know it just depends on the bar." also, it blew her mind that my living social deal was on my phone, and she left with my phone for 5 minutes to figure out how to mark it used.\u000anow we get into ordering food. i'd been looking forward to escargot for weeks, and i happily ordered it as my appetizer. surprise, they're out of that and 3 other appetizers. ok. meal order time. i'll have the prime rib. nope, out. i'll have the crab cakes. nope, out. i'll have the stuffed shrimp. nope, out. just give me the damn steak.\u000a\u000afood: the joke throughout the night was trying to figure out which aspect of the meal was going to give us life-threatening food poisoning. neil made sure to tell me where the life insurance papers were kept. raw oysters were served at room temperature. my seafood coquille was gross and looked like cat food. french onion soup looked like dirty dish water and was too salty to eat due to the insane amount of parm cheese. the spinach salad actually wasn't half bad. the bacon dressing, though, did taste more like bacos bacon than real bacon. finally, the steaks. they were basically truck stop steaks. you know, they're good because it's a steak, but it's not seasoned at all. we used copious amounts of salt, pepper and some of our blended red wine that remained to season it up. the pasta side was supposed to be in garlic butter sauce, and i tasted no garlic. the broccoli was disgusting and microwaved. every single table that got broccoli sent it back untouched at the end of the meal.\u000a\u000a\u000aother gems: you could hear people yelling in the kitchen. watching a man in gym shorts and a ratty tshirt deliver food to the bar.  frozen butter.  our waitress not being able to read the wine labels because "she didn't have her glasses on."

Voh boy!  as one other poster says, what a little hidden gem!  why go to buca de beppo or olive garden when you can come here?  seriously, this is one of the wonderful old-time family restaurants that makes pittsburgh so great!\u000a\u000abegin your meal with either of my favorites, the pomidoro e mozzarella, which is sliced tomatoes with basil and mozzarella cheese served cold.  the mozzarella here is fabulous!  or you might like the carmela's  house  antipasto, which is italian lunch meats, roasted red peppers, cheeses, and olives!\u000a\u000athey have wonderful salads here including salmon, fried chicken, and a steak salad that's a meal unto itself.  i recommend the house italian dressing!\u000a\u000athey are well-known for the pizza here, but i prefer the seafood.  my favorite is the salmon, which is always tender and flaky, and never tough.  it is served with caper dill, honey glaze,  and dolce berry.  or if i want to splurge, especially if someone else is paying (!), i like to get the talapia with crab  & shrimp florentine.  if i'm in the mood for pasta here, i like the crab and shrimp tortellini.  the pasta here is a little on the al dente side, which is the way i like it.  and the pasta dishes come with salad and bread.  \u000a\u000aa few things.  this place is a little out of the way.  if you don't have a car, it is approximately a half-mile from the monongahela incline.  also parking here is a little tight.  this place is very popular, so you might want to get a reservation.  and i don't believe they serve alcohol here (i'm almost a non-drinker anyway), but i think they allow byob.

Vto celebrate my getting a huge promotion at work, my husband rick took me out to dinner.  he decided to surprise me and while we were still on carson street, he told me to close my eyes.  as i felt the car go uphill and take some twists and turns, i assumed we were on sycamore street.  i was going nuts.  was he taking me to some of the restaurants by the duquesne incline?  if so, why didn't he simply take the mccardle roadway up?  imagine my surprise when he told me i could open my eyes.  he remembered that i like this little cafe.\u000a\u000awe began our meal with my favorite, carmela's antipasto (italian lunch meats, roasted red peppers, and cheeses).  we then moved on to the tomato salad.  since rick said i could order what i wanted, the steak sounded tempting, but i was in the mood for some good italian.  my chicken cacciatore was absolutely delicious.  my husband however did avail himself of ye olde red meat and ordered the 8oz new york strip steak.  \u000a\u000aand let's face it folks, no italian meal is complete without some good cannoli or tiramisu.  but which to get?  aha, order both and share!

Vi love the carnegie library.  in summer months, i'll walk through the park from my home in squirrel hill!  \u000a\u000awith dvds and vhs tapes and new and old books, why go to netflix or barnes and noble?  as an avid reader and film fan, i like to come here every two to three weeks to check out new books and movies.  i especially love the geneology department.  i was doing my family history and they were most helpful here.\u000a\u000asometimes when i want to escape, and have a few hours of susan time, i'll come here just to browse and read.  i also love checking out a book on a nice day and taking it over to the nearby park to read.

Vthe carnegie libraries of pittsburgh are absolutely one of the most amazing and crucial resources of this fine region. information should be free to the people! knowledge is power! \u000a\u000aone day, i was moving to yet another hip, affordable, and stylish apartment, and i realized i owned too many books. i consider up to 10 boxes of books a "small library," so you know i had a serious problem if i was confessing i had too many! i looked at my budget and realized i was spending - literally - hundreds of dollars a month on books. books that i loved and treasured, and then set aside and never read again. \u000a\u000awell, i sold all the books i could bear to live without, and traded my book budget in for a clpgh library card. i've been reading more, fresher material, books that were often too expensive for me to buy, the books that **never** went on sale, and my book passion went from extremely expensive to voraciously insatiable within a month. i read so much more now that everything is delivered to my local branch. i do weekly pick-ups and drop-offs. the whole thing has brought a level of bliss to my life that i didn't even realize i was missing. \u000a\u000athe check-out times are adequate, most of the staff goes above and beyond in their every word and deed, providing small kindnesses and excellent recommendations. they have dvds, vhs, and cds as well. they have virtually every magazine you could want --  visit the main branch for a coffee shop, extensive stacks, an exquisitely re-modeled library, and a beautiful magazine reading room complete with a zen garden outdoor courtyard. \u000a\u000abless you, andrew carnegie, and bless you, clpgh staff!

Vi love the library! and i'm so glad it's open during the evening. what better way to spend a rainy, crummy evening than perusing the shelves in search of some great literary work? heck i didn't even come here with any plan or even an idea of what i wanted. i simply knew i needed some october reading. and while it's true i could have gone to the squirrel hill branch, which is right around the corner from my house, there's just something about immersing one's self amongst the stacks of a big old main library. \u000a\u000aso i found some wonderful reading material and headed over to the quiet reading room to look it over.  this room is a fabulous place to go when the weather is too lousy to take a book outside.  i relaxed in a comfortable leather chair and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere as i was about to examine the collection bound words in my hands.  \u000a\u000aand which great tome did i select?  "kingsblood royal" by sinclair lewis.  i'd previously read some of sinclair lewis's works before including "main street" and "it can't happen here" (a truly frightening tale on what if fascism took over in the united states).  but i'd never even heard of, much less read "kingsblood royal" before.  i tell you, there's a feeling i get when i sit down and i'm about to read a great book. it's better than opening a favorite candybar, or trying on a new pair of boots for the first time.  or when i'm about to try some exotic ice cream flavor i've never tasted before.  maybe it's the feel or smell of the printed page.  maybe it's the feeling that i'm about to become one with the author.   it's a feeling that i'll never get from a kindle.  \u000a\u000alibraries are wonderful places and they're far from obsolete.  may they never be replaced by the e-reader.

Vthis is a great library.  if you want to research something, or just find an enjoyable dvd or book, this is the place to go.  the music library is fantastic, there's lots of sheet music, cd's and movies.  there's a small cafe on the first floor, and the food and coffee is excellent.  the pennsylvania collection has some materials that you will find no place else, and it's especially good for geneology.  the children's room is wonderful and the librarians there are great.  a couple of cool features that i love about this library are the bamboo garden and also a place in the stacks that you can use to peek into the dinosaur hall.  lots of pcs with internet access that you can borrow.  helpful librarians.

Vi feel that they should have taped the library scene for ghostbusters here instead of in new york.  honestly, i do.  there's a very grand type of entrance, nestled behind trees that makes you want to mosey on up the stairs.  no trotting, skipping or walking is needed.  just mosey on up there.  heck, if you feel like it, take a moment and take in the air out front and just marvel at the building.\u000a\u000ainside it's a bit of a labyrinth to navigate.  i have never been inside this branch before, but it is huge.  tons of seating for any number of people to enjoy.  i discovered that my favorite place to sit and let the hours go by is in the bamboo garden.  quite the perfect place to sit and get your work done.  i didn't even realize that i let a couple of hours slip away until i was done.  perfect weather allows for you to enjoy that bamboo garden.\u000a\u000astaff are super courteous and helpful beyond means.  able to answer any question and direct you to where you need to go.  of course the book selection is amazing.  unfortunately my recent visit didn't allow me to browse the books, but i'm sure since i work right up the street i'd stop in to browse on a break.  maybe even just sit in here for the peace and quiet it offers.\u000a\u000ahuge bonus, free wi-fi if you have a library card.

Vi never would have even thought to stop in kohli's if it wasn't for jb. he works near by and knows i love the scent of nag champa incense so he bought me some. while i was waiting for him to get out of work one day, i stopped in to take a peek at what they had to offer. my shopping basket filled up fast - jasmine rice, naan, samosa, mint chutney (try mixing that in some cous cous or quinoa and peas and pignolia), piri piri, ginger paste, cilantro chutney... the list goes on.\u000a\u000athe goods you find here cost half of what you pay at giant eagle and other grocery chains. all i can say is that this place is amazing and i'm so happy it exists.

Vthis place is great. young crowd, cheap drinks ($1.50 select beers and $5 pitchers, can't beat that). i wouldn't come here for dinner, it's more of a dive bar than a restaurant. definitely loud, crowded and messy which is not always a bad thing.

Vthis place was not nearly as gross as i anticipated. in the middle of oakland, rusty sign... i mean the place screams undergrad. no thank you. i was persuaded to go here one friday (after the semester was over) for happy hour, and had a good time. i mean, yes, you can buy pitchers of shots here, but you can also get sam adams in the 16oz super nice sam adams glass for $7 and keep the glass. it's pretty big inside, wasn't crowded or smokey, and the food was not that bad for bar food. i had a chicken, bacon, avocado wrap, and it was tasty. friends had burgers, and they cleaned their plates. hemingway's, you went from hideous undergrad hangout in my mind to an establishment i would patronize!

Vonce again this is more a concert review than a review of the actual venue.  my girlfriends and i went there last night to see joe grushecky & the houserockers last night.\u000a\u000aoh, and some guy named bruce springsteen was also on stage!  \u000a\u000ait would be too easy to dismiss bruce springsteen as a gigastar so far removed from his roots that music no longer matters to him.  i read something comparing him to his compatriots bob seger (who has long retired), john mellencamp (who is getting back to his roots) and john fogerty.  if springsteen is now a multigazillionaire, you sure wouldn't have known it last night.  he came on stage and said "i'm opening for joe tonight!"  \u000a\u000aoh yeah, and this show was all about joe grushecky & the houserockers featuring bruce springsteen.  joe & company weren't backing up bruce.  it was the 15th anniversary of their joint cd "american babylon" and a lot of songs last night were from that album.  the group launched into "american babylon" and also did "never be enough time" and my favorite, "homestead".  i really like that song 'cos it gives you the history of the homestead works and now the irony is there's a big box center on the site where you can buy goods made in china.  they also played the seminal favorite, "talk to the king".\u000a\u000aspringsteen fans weren't disappointed though 'cos the band also did "thunder road", "atlantic city", and "fire".  for those fans of grushecky's old band, the iron city houserockers, they did "pumping iron, sweating steel".  \u000a\u000ai've never figured out how these two guys know each other, but they are old friends and it certainly showed on stage last night.  they were having a great time up there!  so were we.  the funny thing is i only have one joe grushecky & the houserockers cd, "end of the century" and only one iron city houserockers, "pumping iron, sweating steel, the best of..".  but boy-o-boy, this was one of the best concerts i've been to in a long time and i've been to a lot this year.\u000a\u000aoh, and one other thing.  i'm s-o-o-o-o glad this amazing concert was my 400th review!

Vit was supposed to have been a one-time thing, wasn't it?  you know, a single two-night stand of a collaboration between an international music star and a local favorite.  wasn't it only a year ago that these two combined at soldiers and sailors memorial hall for an electrifying night of music?\u000a\u000aso when it was announced that on november 4, 2011 bruce springsteen would be again joining his old pal joe grushecky (and the houserockers) on the very same stage, i viewed it with some trepidation.  after all, sequels usually suck don't they?  either that or part ii is never quite as good as part i.  right?  so i thought as my friend marla and i entered the concert hall.  \u000a\u000aand i might add we might have very well bought the last two tickets available for the show because we were w-a-y in the back.  but hey, it's  a 2700 seat venue so even the last row is pretty good.\u000a\u000aour fears were for naught.  gurshecky/springsteen 2011 was every bit as good as the 2010 version!  \u000a\u000athe show began with johnny grushecky's (joe's son) band the composure.  i don't know their material at all, however bruce got up on stage and joined them in an impromptu version of "dancing in the dark".  bruce then went into an acoustic solo set of "for you", "land of hope and dreams", on which he played acoustic guitar and harmonica, and "i'll work for your love".  now think about it, if you're a local band like joe grushecky & the houserockers, how do you take the stage after a lovely set like that?  and are you up to the challenge?\u000a\u000awell joe and the boys sure were!  they went into "everything's going to work out right" followed by "swimming with the sharks" before going into a bruce song, "atlantic city".  the rest of the evening was spent going back-n-forth between springsteen & grushecky material, including "code of silence", "glory days", "never be enough time", "because the night", "talking to the king", joe and bruce dueting on "fire", and my own favorite--the springsteen-penned, grushecky-recorded "homestead"  ("i heard all 'bout the 12 hour shifts in the mill/and our union brothers the pinkertons tried hard to kill/heard about frick & carnegie the day the river ran red/and how the union caved in in homestead")*  \u000a\u000aas the newspaper said, "many bands can replicate the springsteen oeuvre note-for-note, but the houserockers are probably the only band outside the e street band who get the subtle nuances of the material without drowning in parody".\u000a\u000aall in all it was another terrific night of music.  will they return for 2012?  we can only hope. \u000a\u000afrom last year's show http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8c9zodjgc0\u000aand this year's http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oliefx8ks\u000a\u000a*note--both of my grandfathers worked in the mills so i think that's why this song resonates with me.  and yes, i am very pro-labor and pro-union!

Vmidway back there's a counter with a cook making biryanis, and they are very good. the chicken makhani was the best i've had, there's not much lettuce but the chicken and rice is what's important.\u000a\u000athere's a small grocery in the front with a bunch of rte meals, spices (fenugreek, cumin, citric acid), pitas, lassis, the standard soda array, homemade hummus, and other things i'm sure i'm forgetting. there's also a butcher in the back that i haven't tried.\u000a\u000amost importantly, everyone who works here is incredibly welcoming and friendly. they will go out of their way to make sure you have what you need. i wish i had found out about this place sooner.

Vthis is where i have to when i get injured at work (sorry, i can't tell you where i work or who i work for...ok im a ninja assassin so if i go missing tomorrow...do not look for me, you'll only be endangering yourself and the people you love). all jokes aside, this is pretty legit place, i get in and get out rather quickly, the employees are friendly and attentive. dr. stuart will give you visuals to understand what's wrong and why its important and what to do for a speedy recovery.

Vthe food is really great, but last time i checked the online menu i didn't see nanna's gnocchi which was my favorite dish. the service is hit or miss. joe mama's is really the only sit down place in oakland that doesn't make you feel like you're on a college campus even though you are.

Vi've had better, but i can't complain either.  my most recent visit here i ordered a burger and fries.  simple right?  well simple is what i got.  all i got was the burger and the bun.  that's it, nothing else.  to say that it ended up being dry is an understatement.  of course when you get it to go, you don't realize these things until well after you end up at home, it's kind of a bummer.  yes, i know i could add my own condiments, but what about the lettuce, onion, tomato, etc.?  i don't always have those readily available.  also, i know they are sister restaurants with the spot next door, but the burger was made identical to the one next door, it needed it's own identity.  the fries were less than impressive as well.  oh well, i should have stuck to what they are known for, italian food, not a burger (i should have known, my prior visits i stuck to the pasta dishes).\u000a\u000aas for what the inside looks like, i love it.  there is more than enough ample seating on multiple floors.  i like sitting upstairs when you can.  not sure why, but it always seems like a different atmosphere up there.  i do like that they have the bathrooms downstairs as well, doesn't get in the way.\u000a\u000ai'll be back for sure, but not any time soon.

Vjust had the best spinach pie in my life, so fresh and garlicky! jb and the inlaws all had chicken tandoori and each were raving about it. i tasted the basmati rice which was light & fluffy and sooo full of flavor.  salims catered a friends wedding last year andthere were absolutely no complaints. salims is amazing!  can't wait to go back!!

Vi love the food here, plus i also use the store to buy ingredients.  the spinach pies are great.  the hummus, baba ghanough, and taboulee are made fresh and taste delicious.  also love the sleek.  there's a middle eastern place in the strip, but salim's is much more consistent and is much more likely to have what i am looking for.

Vthe crust was really good, but there was too much cheese / too little sauce. the cheese was undercooked a little as well, not burnt or bubbly, and it separated from the slice. we ordered near closing though, so it might be better earlier in the day.

Vfirst off i have to admit that my rating is pretty biased because i have somewhat of a sentimental attachment to this hotel. i stayed here for a year and a half (gasp!) for business during a project in pittsburgh. it's not a glamorous hotel, but it has what you need for a comfortable stay.\u000a\u000astandard hampton amenities: complimentary breakfast, coffee & tea available 24 hrs in the lobby, free wireless internet, hotel shuttle, etc.\u000a\u000aspecial extras: free passes to a full local gym just up the block, a small "business" office with access to a phone, a computer, and a printer, the location is very convenient, and the staff (namely the hotel managers) who work there are just plain great people.\u000a\u000ai gave 4 stars and not 5 because it is still a hampton inn, and i wouldn't give less because they put a lot into good service.\u000a\u000aif you need to stay there, ask for jeff (the general manager) and tell him that angela sent you. :)

Vi've only been here once on my lunch break from work. it is definitely one of the better places to get takeout in oakland. i had vegetable noodle soup which was good. i also ordered a salad with ginger dressing - the salad was very basic but the dressing was phenomenal! it's probably from a bottle but it was finger licking good - i didn't waste any that's for sure. i will most likely return.

Vi agree with l s. - i've always enjoyed lulu's.  it brings back happy memories of high school field trips and the freedom to walk the single block from the carnegie museum to grab lunch.\u000a\u000atheir thai iced tea and bubble teas are both good.  the spring rolls come with delicious sauce on the side, and all of the vegetarian entrees are appealing.  the portions are huge and inexpensive, and the location is convenient for students, med center employees, and those visiting the museum or the nationality rooms.  sure it's not high-class cuisine, but for what it is, it's good, filling, and affordable.

Vthe food is decent, not great, not authentic by any stretch of the imagination, but fairly priced for portion-size, and generally tasty enough.  i highly recommend the crab rangoon if you like the sweet cream cheesy kind.  yum!  and i like the pad thai even if it is sweet and not authentic as well as the curry chicken.  (fyi: my order of the curry chicken and crab rangoon came out to $9 after tax)\u000a\u000ai don't often eat at the restaurant itself, i am more a order-from-wheeldeliver.com or pick-up person.  service isn't great, which is probably why i avoid eating in-house.  bear in mind that parking on the street in the area is generally hard to find unless it is mid-day in the middle of the week.

Vgood noodle bowls, very bad curry. the menu is huge and is all over the place with chinese/japanese/thai dishes, so it's always a hit or miss unless you're getting something you had before. crab rangoon was bad, it consisted of only sweet cream cheese... where were the crab stick pieces??\u000a\u000athe bubble tea is great: soft, chewy tapioca and a few different flavors to choose from. the coconut milkshake i tried was also really good.\u000a\u000athe ambiance is like a school cafeteria, lots of tables, not very clean and pretty bare, the noise travels well here.

Vthe food is good. the prices are good. the service usually leaves something to be desired that's why i usually order take out. i love hot & sour soup but for some reason, they are usually "out" when i try to order it (usually around 6p).\u000a\u000abottom line, you get what you pay for.

Vi've eaten here twice. the first time, the food wasn't particularly good. the second time, the food was average, but not particularly exceptional. lulus still gets three stars, though, because it's inexpensive and the bubble tea & bubble smoothies are delicious.

Vi've been eating at lulu's for years, and i especially love the reasonable prices and good service.  there are several dishes that i consistently order, and one i'd like to highlight is the basil chicken dish.  it's delicious, very flavorful and the portion size is generous.  the location in oakland is convenient to the many events i go to, so i find it  a great place to meet friends.

Vsadly, i've outgrown this place.  at least when it comes to a place to hang out at.  with that it's just a reminder that i'm getting older.  \u000a\u000ai came here after work one night to meet a few people.  it was close for us all, and probably the best pick.  there aren't that many bars in oakland to choose from.  what i walked into was a country night college fiasco, and to make it weirder, they were doing some samba or salsa dancing upstairs.  rowdy and inconsiderate college kids everywhere.  makes me wonder if i was that bad back when i was in college.\u000a\u000aservice was slow at times.  they do have servers roaming the floor looking to see if you need anything, but the whole time our group was at our table, we never had a visit.  at the bar i swear the only person i say there 100% of the time was the bar back.  you'd have to wave him down to go find a bartender.  \u000a\u000ai left there with a different view of this place than i did years ago.  i may return to this place in time to try their food fare during daylight hours, but never again to enjoy an after work drink.

Vjimmy johns is fast. so fast that they forgot to put sprouts on my tuna sandwich. considering that was the primary reason i got said tuna salad sandwich, i'm pretty bummed. the tuna salad itself is chunk light tuna, not even whole albacore, and has a pretty fishy taste to it.  i'll give 'em another try, and hopefully bump this review up another star.

Vcaliban book shop has to be the most remarkable bookstore in the 'burgh.  it isn't quite a used bookstore.  you don't go here expecting to find used paperbacks of steinbeck or dickens.  no, this is really much more of an antique and collector's bookstore.  as a reviewer on another site says, the first thing you notice upon entering the place is the sweet scent of old books.  i found an old book on pop music once as a gift for my dad.  he really loved it.\u000a\u000athey do get used textbooks and not-so-rare paperbacks too.  so if you want to escape the look-alike world of the major chains (barnes & noble or borders, not that there's anything wrong with those places) then by all means, drop in here!

Vthere's a usa today article, an old one, posted on the wall here.  it lists the top ten ice cream shops in america.  many years ago, being bored and young, i said what the heck, and visited every shop listed above dave & andy's on that list.  \u000a\u000atom's ice cream bowl in zanesville, ohio, was the strongest competition for "best", but only won if you counted the food; dave & andy's, hands down, was the best ice cream we got to try within a drive from boston to florida.\u000a\u000athe waffle cones are to die for, and the ice cream is fresh, delicious, and perfect in almost every way.  really, best of the best.

Vi had previously had their cookies & cream ice cream when a friend brought a pint over, and i wasn't impressed.  it was pretty bland and freezer-burned with only minuscule flecks of cookies.  in the store, i tried a sample of the blood orange sorbet, which was completely flavorless, and i was getting ready to give up when i decided to try the cookie dough ice cream.  it was creamy with huge chunks of cookie dough - exactly what ice cream should be.  the cone was good but not great.\u000a\u000aas for the store and the staff, a long line moved quickly and the store smells delicious due to the made-in-house cones.  i wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but it's definitely not bad if you're in the neighborhood.

Vi consider myself somewhat of an ice cream connoisseur.  dave and andy's offers reasonably priced hard-packed homemade ice cream.  however, i didn't think it was anything special.  when i was here there were about ten flavors to choose from, all pretty run-of-the-mill, and i went with birthday cake.\u000a\u000ait wasn't bad, heck, it was ice cream--but it was really nothing special.   i wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but i'm looking forward to trying other ice cream places in pittsburgh.

Vbitchiest customer service ever. i'm sorry i asked for a sample, i didn't know you were gonna go on a 5-minute lecture about how if the description of an ice cream says white chocolate cinnamon habanero, it probably tastes like that. sounds like customer service might not be the strongest point for you...

Vthe first of it's kind in pittsburgh, and although there's lots more competition, dave and andy's is still a clear winner in my mind.  the ice cream here is handmade and quite delicious.  the cones are made fresh and taste wonderful. best ice cream in pittsburgh.

Vnice middle-eastern place near cmu.\u000ai usually get the 'vegetarian special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). they also have awesome 'sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.\u000athe owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when i get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.\u000aawesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, i could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st.

Vi'm really in a quandary here, i believe this place to be a 3.5, so i'm on the low side of the middle.\u000a\u000athe case for: the food was pretty darn good. i wouldn't say amazing. the naan was solid, the samosas were solid, we tried their version of chicken strips (which were a little weird, but fair enough); randy s. had a good spinach dish, mine was chicken vindaloo, which was pretty darn good. it's open late, lots of indian people there, which is at least reassuring and also makes the experience more indian. \u000a\u000athe case against: it's pretty average in terms of indian food. it would be a place i would be happy to go if i felt like indian food and someone suggested it, but i can't imagine really beating a path there. it was almost impossible to find parking too. \u000a\u000ai think i'm going to keep it at 3, but it's recommended. i would have no hesitance to say it's good and someone should go if they are looking for good indian in p-burgh. it's just a little average.

Vmaybe i went on an off night, or maybe i shouldn't have gotten the buffet, but it really wasn't that great. the naan was rock hard, most of the food items weren't fresh; and well, it was just meh. i'll try it again and order off their vast menu which hopefully will result in a better quality of food.

Vwent during lunch over the weekend, and it was easily one of the very best indian buffets i've had a chance to eat at.  the spinach and mushroom dish was delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options here.  whereas it doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment bar; chutneys, raita, kheer, etc, was one of the most complete i've seen.\u000a\u000awill head there again.

Vsolid lunch buffet with naan, pakoras, about 6 veggie dishes, 3 chicken, and 1 goat curry.  service was iffy - we sometimes waited a while for our drinks to be refilled, and it wasn't really clear that we had to go up to the counter to pay until we saw someone else do it.  it was really quiet, which i was not expecting based on the other reviews.  the matar paneer and the tofu palak were good, the aloo gobi and the chana masala were good, the dish with the baby potatoes was ok.  the salad bar section was under a green light so it was hard to tell what everything was, and not everything was labeled.\u000a\u000athere was a $3 off two lunch buffets coupon in the clipper magazine, but it still came to $18.  either they're charging a lot for soda or the buffet is more expensive than it says it is on the website.  but the food was pretty good and i'd definitely be willing to come back during the 1/2 off hours.

Vbeen to the oakland and monroeville locations, usually for the buffet - the food is good but the service could be better (at both locations). i always feel as though i'm being rushed out of there, even when it isn't busy. and honestly, would it kill any one of the waitstaff to crack a smile?

Vthis is one of the strangest restaurants ever. the entrance is an almost-hidden door at the corner of a block that leads you into a narrow, not-so-clean staircase down into the basement. you might mistaken buying lunch for buying some other questionable things, but rest assure you're going the right way. at the bottom of the stairs you'll see a door that only opens if you're still standing on the stairs because otherwise it will hit you. okay, now you're in the restaurant. \u000a\u000awhen you first walk in, you'll find a row of refrigerators with beverages like you would at a gas station convenient store. the difference is that the whole row is filled with beer, all kinds of beer. you can get 40s, 6-packs of domestic, imports, hard lemonades, etc. \u000a\u000aafter describing all that, the weirdest part is... this is a fast-food korean restaurant! you can get bulgogi, kalbi, duk in soup, kim chi, etc. weird right? the food is decent and it's a great lunch spot in the heart of oakland. if you haven't been here, just the experience is worth the trip!

Vthe best late night food in pittsburgh. the food is good, it tends toward fried and salty but that's fine. portions are ridiculous. i love mustard, and by far the best mustard i've ever had was here. the pizzas are done well in a brick oven. but even if you hate everything else, the beers alone are worth the trip.

Vthis place wasn't as good as we were expecting.  my pizza (classic maggie) was good, but nothing outstanding.  my husband's burger was completely charred and basically inedible.  we didn't bother sending it back as our waitress was nowhere to be found.\u000a\u000ait's your typical bar food with a decent beer selection...nothing more, nothing less.

Vapparently they have waffle fries again... they took it off temporarily so they could increase its price on the menu...\u000a\u000ai guess i have to give them a star back. (did you know mad mex has waffle fries too now?)\u000a\u000athe standards are pretty much their pizzas (smashed potato, buffalo chicken, etc.), waffle fries, and sweet potato fries after 11 pm when almost everything is half priced.  the wait is long as it gets ridiculously crowded as the masses of cmu and pitt kids head down (if you miss the 11 pm rush, get ready to wait close to an hour).  since waffle fries are pretty much the only reason to go to fuel and fuddle and there's no late night discount on them, i'd recommend going before 11 pm and just grab a drink with your fries and then head out to enjoy the rest of your night.  their house beer is excellent and i believe they have a rotating tap.\u000a\u000aif it happens to be thursday, friday or saturday night and you're still hungry, you can head down to sphinx cafe where a guy grills up hot dogs (2 for $3), burgers (2 for $5), and pulled beef from 10:30 pm until 3:30 am right outside.

Vi've never gone to f&f for late-night, which is when the line can stretch out the door. however, the lunch menu is reasonably priced and the pizzas are amazing - some of my favorite anywhere.\u000a\u000aalso, f&f has a wide selection of beer, and even has a beer bible where you can fill out the beers you've tried.

Vgo after 11pm for the half priced food and experience one of the best bar-food menus in pittsburgh. the sweet-potato fries are the best i've ever had, the pizzas are always good, and the sandwiches are big. when i go i mostly order off of the appetizer menu.  never had a bad time here, but if you aren't there at 11pm then expect a wait of up to 40 minutes. i've had some people be skeptical when i've said it's worth the wait, but i've never had a complaint once the food came. also it isn't very expensive before the half-off, so i've been here many times during the day - you just feel kind of bad that you could be getting it for so much less

Vi used to frequent this establishment all the time, before loud & obnoxious college students began to annoy me that is. the beer selection is great and almost everything i've eaten has been good. but be warned that most things that go into that woodfire oven tend to come out burnt. keeping that in mind i usually got the veghead sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. the sammie is served on a very thick bun, i like bread so it didn't really bother me. if you're watching your carbs you can get it downsized to a wrap instead. \u000a\u000ait's almost impossible to get in after dinner hours because of the half off deals, you'll have about an hour wait any evening of the week - outside, in the cold. the food is good but it's not that good.\u000a\u000aps - sorry for hating on the youngsters, i have embraced the fact that im just getting too old.

Vi went during the lunch rush, but it was waaaayyyyyyyy too loud for me.  i had a guacamole themed salad, but instead of actual guacamole it had this weird thin spicy guacamole style dressing, which made me sad.

Vhow i missed coming here on the regular.  things happen for a reason and i am happy they happen the way they did.  my time away from being a regular here has made me appreciate it more than before.\u000a\u000ait's still crowded, it's still small in size, and it's still as loud as can be.  but that does not deter me from entering, as it should not deter you.  the food is just as good as i can remember too.  even though it had been some time since i dined here, i still ended up getting my old reliable.  the befuddling sirloin burger is still as befuddling as i remember.  the 100 proof bourbon bbq sauce is just enough on this sandwich that i never need to top it with anything else.  their burgers are amazing, not a traditional patty in any sense.  it's not round, it's like it was round then they decided to take a rolling pin to it and elongated it.  good thing they did too, to fit the bun they put it on, it cannot be round.  the bread sometimes puts it over the top and really makes it a gut buster.  also, i didn't need any other side than their handful of russet and sweet potato fries, a great compliment to a great sandwich.  \u000a\u000amy friends decided to both have the 1/2 rack ribs.  smothered in the same bbq sauce as my burger made it just as mouth watering.  they put all that deliciousness on top of a bed of what looked like grilled veges.  a really nice mixture i am told.  they also top this off with a handful of the mixed fries.\u000a\u000athe price takes a bit out of the pocket, but it is totally worth it.\u000a\u000a*a few notes about this place: parking is horrible (read as: be prepared to circle the block, or take the hit to use a garage), best to call ahead to get a table at peak hours or sit at the bar, if you don't want to wait visit one of it's sister eateries right next door, delivery available through wheel deliver for a few dollars more.

Vfriendly baristas, and the line usually moves pretty fast. clean interior with plenty of spaces to sit alone or with a group. nice cozy chairs positioned in front of the roaring fireplace during the winter. \u000a\u000ai'm ambivalent about starbucks coffee, but since they have a loyalty program and they're everywhere, it's what i usually drink when i buy coffee.

Vwhen i hover over two stars, it says "meh.  i've experienced better."  with regards to ginza, i've definitely experienced better.\u000a\u000ai went there for dinner last night and had their sundubu.  the banchan or small korean "appetizers" that are served with the food was forgettable.  the sundubu came with tofu (of course), pork, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and a clam.  first thing i noticed was that there was no egg...  the rice that came with it was overcooked and soggy/sticky.  that is definitely not a good sign for any asian restaurant (chinese, japanese, korean, whatever... even orient express has better rice).  i found the sundubu itself to be on the bland side.  maybe they mellowed it out a lot for the american palate?  i'm not used to sundubu's with zucchini so i first thought hmm, this could be interesting.  unfortunately the zucchini was cooked to a mush and completely unappetizing.  the rest of the jiggae was okay; not spectacular but not terrible, but i would've liked a bit less mushroom and a bit more tofu... it is tofu stew after all.\u000a\u000ai'll give ginza another try with one of their meat dishes, but until then my rating will be sitting at 2 stars.  it's hard to justify going to ginza when oishii and korea garden are both right around the corner.

Vthis hotel could easily get higher ratings if they offered wifi in the rooms, and if they did something to minimize the outside street noise getting in.  my room was very big, had 2 bathrooms, one with jacuzzi-like bath tub.  oh, their soap and shampoo smell really awful.  the breakfast is pretty decent for the north, but dinner was mediocre.

Vthis oakland dive bar is a haven for hospital staff just getting off of the night shift. at 7am people in scrubs line the bar and tables. the beer selection is alright (at least they have new castle) and at 8am you can go over to the diner next door, order a (greasy) breakfast for $5 - bacon or sausage, eggs, hashbrowns and toast - and they will bring your order to you.\u000a\u000ait's a perfect place to go with some coworkers right after a night of hell.

Vi have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  i should have waited a bit longer i suppose.  the experience i had was not stellar at all.\u000a\u000ai opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  i should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  when the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  a very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  with me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, i had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.\u000a\u000afrom the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  if they consider this a handful of fries, i consider that they have a two year old working there.  i counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  the breaded chicken was actually good.  it appears that they may make it on site (i cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  easily the best part of the salad.\u000a\u000aone other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  but it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion.

Vknown as "ok" back when i was at school in pittsburgh, this restaurant was the best for large groups (10-12) to share a big round table and share a good chinese meal. our regular dishes included fresh vegetables (do miao, bakchoy, bai chai), salty pork chops, salty squid, general tso's chicken, mapo tofu, and other dishes we would miss from back home. also try the california roll - it's not typical and has a bit of a cantonese twist to it. maybe it's the rice, but i think it's yummy. this place reminds me of a restaurant you can find in chinatown or flushing, ny. the food is pretty good, and if you're craving chinese food (not the take out kind) ok can hit the spot.

Vorient kitchen, known as "oc" among the college students (i'm not quite sure where the c comes from), is traditionally the place where students go for large group dinner celebrations, but i've been there for just dinner as well before.  dishes are usually ordered family style, which is everyone sharing multiple dishes; the usual suspects include salt and pepper squid, shrimp w/ mayo, chinese watercress (kong xing cai) or baby pea sprouts (do miao), and crispy fried milk.  sometimes i've ordered their peking duck, but its nothing spectacular, china palace serves up better peking duck.  also their twice cooked pork is also lackluster.\u000a\u000aoc has a decent liquor selection, and their drinks are relatively cheap at under 5 dollars each.\u000a\u000aprices for dishes are typically in the lower to mid teens; a typical check tends to run around 20ish for those with larger appetites, drinks not included.\u000a\u000aoc is pretty good canto food by pittsburgh standards, but for people who are use to better options for cantonese style chinese food found in more asian-populated cities, the food may leave more to be desired.

Vgroceria merante's deli has the best sandwiches in pittsburgh, at the best prices. $10 for a whole sandwich (on a whole loaf of bread) or $5 for a half (on a half loaf of bread), these sandwiches should last you the entire day. plus, the grocery is fantastic, with imported italian foods.\u000a\u000afinally, the legend of the sandwich is this. one day, a pitt student wandered out of bed, hungover, and walked down to the local deli. he asked for a sandwich, they pulled out a loaf of bread, and loaded it with meat, cheese, and peppers. the next day, a small sign by the cash register advertised sandwiches for sale. and they've been serving them ever since.

Vthis is a great pizza hut location!  on our first couple nights in pittsburgh, my husband and i ordered from here online.  they delivered it to our hotel--the pizza was hot (and delicious, compared to most pizza hut locations), the delivery was quick, and the drivers were friendly.\u000a\u000anow i'm sure there are better local pizza joints around, but we needed dinner and we needed it delivered--pittsburgh streets are scary!  i would recommend this place to anyone in a similar situation, or pizza hut lovers near shadyside...

Vthe nellie's take out menu says "homemade good tasty middle eastern food" and that says it all. i ordered take out from nellie's expecting it to be good because one of my co-workers recommended it. all this time i thought that baba d's was the be all end all for gyros in oakland, but they definitely have competition from the lesser known nellie's.\u000a\u000athe feel of this little corner restaurant really is that of a homey, authentic kitchenette. if i had a greek/lebanese/mideastern grandma, this is how i would imagine her food to taste. i am going back many more times to try their dishes, but for now i will recommend the gyros, the special of the day (it's chicken and beef rice, i forget what it's called), and the baklava was awesome. i had the grape leaves and they were good, not incredible. i will go back to try their spanikopita, meat pie, spinach pie, and falafel, not necessarily in that order. we'll see what my stomach desires each time.\u000a\u000athe prices are fair - the combo platters are $8.50, their a la carte dishes are in the $4-6 range. they are only opened monday through fridays from 11am to 5pm. they advertise deliveries too, but i don't know the details.\u000a\u000aall of us walk by, drive by, and see this place so many times without stopping in. trust me, it's about time.... that is if you find a parking spot in oakland. good luck!

Vnellie's brings a much needed respite from regular ol' sandwiches, soups and pizza that pervade the oakland lunch scene. \u000a\u000amy recent favs are the falafel and tabouli. oooh, that tabouli... so flavorful with the parsley and citrus, man it's good on a ripped pita section! recent dislike is the hummos; i find it too "earthy." the service is nice and typically prompt, they accept cards (there's a minimum charge amount), and the location is a plus for those of us who work at the top of the hill. stop in, and give some local business owners your patronage!

Vnot great, but definitely a-ok.  most of the vegetarian entrees are $9.99 and a handful are $10.99 through campus food.  samosas were 2 for $3.50 and they are kind of small, but that was really the only disappointing aspect.  there is a vegetarian appetizer platter that comes with one samosa, about four mixed vegetable pakoras, and a big aloo kachori.  this was really yummy and only $1.50 more than an order of samosas.  the vegetable korma was very good and flavorful.  my order randomly came with an apple - for dessert? - so that was cool.  the food came in less time than expected, and the portions were big enough to have plenty of leftovers.  \u000a\u000athe vegetarian thali sounds like a lot of food, and is a lot for one but not quite enough for two.  it comes in a divided tin tray - half dal, then about 1/4 matar paneer and 1/4 aloo gobhi or chana masala.   their matar paneer is very good - i'm not sure if they use fresh peas, but they have an interesting pop that frozen peas don't have.  the thali also comes with roti, papadum (ours were missing), raita, and one gulab jamun.  everything was good, just not as much food as we were expecting.\u000a\u000ai would definitely order from here again.

Vdecent but terribly inconsistent food. i've had some great dishes and some terrible ones, i love chaat and 3 out of 4 times it was great, but once it was just a fried greasy mess (in a bad way, not in the good way it usually is.) once the matar paneer was great, once it was oversalted and the peas were just plain bad. i don't know how they do it, but it's a coinflip between good food and an oversalted overcooked bowl.\u000a\u000aeither way, portions are generous.

Vvisited their lunch buffet this past weekend, and i was pleased.  i don't think it is the best indian buffet in pittsburgh (i prefer taste of india by children's hospital) but it was good.  they had four vegetarian dishes (chana masala, pakoras soaking in curry sauce, palak paneer, and an eggplant dish), three chicken dishes (chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and chicken curry), pakoras, papadums, a salad bar, and gulab jamuns.  the eggplant dish was my favorite.  the buffet is $7.99, and we got two $2 off coupons after we paid.  \u000a\u000athe only downside is a lot of their dishes contain nuts, even the ones you wouldn't expect like vegetable korma and paneer tikka masala.  if you have allergies, just ask them to leave the nuts out - i have never found any in my dishes once i started asking the cook to omit them.  \u000a\u000ai also have been ordering from here about once a week and i think they are reasonably priced, the portions are big, their delivery is reliable (they're rarely late and they've occasionally been up to half an hour early), and the food is good.  i'm definitely a big fan.

Vthis seems like a very family-friendly restaurant. the night we went here for dinner, there were 10 or 11 small children actually running around in circles in the restaurant because apparently monsters were hiding under the tables. this was probably an unusual situation since there was a large group of adults having some sort of a get together and they had all brought their children, however i still think it was cool that the restaurant was willing to allow the children to run around. if you're bothered by noise and screaming children, this might not be the place for you (although as mentioned above it probably doesn't happen that often). however, if you have small children and don't want to have to worry about them running around, it might be a good spot for you.\u000a\u000afood wise, it was fairly unremarkable - just your standard indian food. not particularly good, but not bad either.

Va stellar buffet with vegetarian options.\u000a\u000ai usually go at 6 or 7pm, depending my break. the dinner buffet is always warm and fresh. i've never experienced dry rice, however, the vegetable pakorra is always teetering on the dry side.\u000a\u000awhat really sets this place apart is the fresh naan. i get the garlic naan to accompany the buffet, it's the perfect vessel to sop up the spiced sauces and curries.

Vi've tried the pizza and the calzones. the pizza is weird, and incredibly greasy. the tomato sauce is too sweet. the cheese is seperated from the sauce and greasy.\u000a\u000athe calzones are ok, it's mostly the same ingredients, but the dough was a little bit better and the grease didn't seem to explode out of the thing as much.

Vthis is one of my most favorite places on earth.\u000ai have come here on countless occasions in the mornings, between-classes, 3am's after finishing an assignment...\u000aits right beside cmu, yet it feels like most cmu people don't know about it.. which is awesome cos the place is very peaceful and serene most of the times.\u000ai mostly walk around through the golf-courses, but visit the trails inside panther hollow and the tiny visitor-center occasionally.\u000aits pretty safe, no matter what time i am in there.. a police-car seems to be taking rounds every half an hour or so during the night.\u000aits not as big as urban parks in other cities, but its still got a lot of charm, a lot of secret trails and nooks to explore.

Vpittsburgh is indeed blessed to have some really great parks like schenley and frick.  i'm so glad i live right between the two.  both have extensive trail systems (frick more so than schenley) and in both parks, it's easy to forget that you're in the middle of a large city (again, frick more so).  it's amazing the length of a hike you can get in here.\u000a\u000amy girlfriends and i went hiking here, meeting up at the schenley park cafe and visitor's center.  we began by looping around flagstaff hill, then by going back towards the visitor's center.  from there we hiked south to the trail connection, around anderson playground to the bridle tail, and down to the south end of the park at greenfield road and bartlett street,  this was a nice intermediate hike of about 2 miles.   we then returned via the panther hollow trail to the visitor's center, a distance of a little under 3/4 mile.  \u000a\u000athen we ramped it up a notch.  yes you can do a vigourous hike through schenley park and that is through the forest area.  we picked up the lower panther hollow trail and explored the woodlands down again to panther hollow road at bartlett street, this time on the opposite side of the road.  now in order to get as much of the trail system in as possible, we had to loop on the hollow run trail, back on down the lower panther hollow trail (again to panther hollow road at bartlett street) before returning on the steve faloon trail.  this segment of our hike was about 3+3/4s miles in length.  this has got to be one of my favorite areas of the park too.  in summer the trees provide a terrific canopy on hot days and the fall colors here are unbeatable.  \u000a\u000awe wrapped things up with a short trip back on the phipps run trail.  the phipps run area is the highest point of the panther hollow valley, and provides access from the schenley park caf and visitor center to panther hollow lake.  pittsburgh parks conservacy began a restoration in 2003 http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=utkjxtimfgrz4r1zdf3kxg&q=phipps+run  all in all we hiked about 6+1/2 miles--not a bad hike for a city park!

Vah, a nice late season afternoon!  what better time to get out there and go for a nice hike?  my cousin and i decided to meet up at schenley park and work off some of those holiday pounds.  so we packed our sammitches, some apples, dried fruit, and filled our water bottles up and hit the trails.  schenley park has an amazing trail system, though they're not as extensive or as isolated as frick park's trails are.\u000a\u000aso we met up at schenley plaza, which is as good a place as any to begin a hike.  we passed the mary schenley fountain, then went down schenley drive past the frick fine arts building and crossing the rail line on schenley bridge.  working our way past the phipps and the schenley park cafe, we crossed panther hollow bridge before setting down on the upper panther hollow trail.  panther hollow trail paralells panther hollow road and skirts the edge of the woodlands.  about halfway down the trail is a neat little footbridge across a dry creek.  we worked our way down to the bartlett street playground.\u000a\u000afrom there we crossed panther hollow road and began working our way west and in a clockwise loop on the bridle trail, which skirts the southern edge of the park.  at this point we were just south of the schenley overlook, which gives you a great view of the pittsburgh skyline.  the overlook is a part of the meadow, home of the skating rink, disc golf course, and a playground.  we turned north as the bridle trail headed back to the visitor's center, passing panther hollow lake again.  \u000a\u000ahere we decided to kick it in a notch.  the trails at this point become more rigorous and go through some scenic wooded areas of the park.  we picked up the lower panther hollow trail, which parallels the hollow run.  we worked our way down again to the bartlett playground & shelter where we took a late lunch break.  we returned via the steve faloon trail, returning back to the visitor's center.  \u000a\u000aall in all we had a great afternoon of hiking and we managed to get in about 5 miles of hiking in without leaving the park's boundaries.

Vlisten, if you're going for the buffet you have to expect that its not going to be gourmet or always fresh out the wok. the foods not always as hot as it probably should be, its going to be a bit dry, and the hot & sour soup is on the salty side (for me to admit that says something) oh and there's no cream cheese wontons?!? the buffets saving grace is the sesame tofu. \u000a\u000ai like the fact that its completely self serve - no waiting for refills!\u000a\u000aif you're in a rush or trying to kill a hangover its not so bad otherwise there are other establishments you may want to check out.

Vi'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to mcdonalds. in fact i hate it. i quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for burger king and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. lame.\u000a\u000ai wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so i caved and let them bring me food from here. i can guarantee that i ate it like a two year old kid. i picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if i could have, i would have fed it to a dog. however, i view that as animal cruelty.\u000a\u000ai give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  that's all my tongue sensed. i hated the food and then myself later that night as i made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time. \u000a\u000aremember, beggars can't be chooser. so when it comes to mcdonalds, panhandle elsewhere.

Vthis location is great in case of an emergency.  i needed to run in and buy an allergy medicine before i wasn't able to see.  it was great t run in, pick up what i needed and use the self check out counters and be on my way.\u000a\u000aas for what the other review says, prices are a bit steep for certain items in the store.  for items that you would expect to be every day items they seem to gouge you on.  but in a pinch, it'll do.  oh, be sure to use the appropriate doors.

Vif you're looking for greasy chinese delivery, look no further.  two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than $20.  the pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next-day lunch leftovers.  the egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot.  not the greatest food i've ever eaten, but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles.\u000a\u000adelivery available through meals delivered. and campus food.  (campus food is cheaper.)

Vevery time i get take out, i swear  i'm never going back but i work at a hospital in oakland so if i don't take something to eat i need to find something quick. szechuan has a scopious menu and i've ordered quite a mix. the portions are massive (with more rice than entree so i always order without it), the tofu is always overfried, sauce is greasy and too salty (even for me & that's saying alot), and the food always tastes fishy. \u000a\u000aafter rereading this i have come to the final decision to never step foot in this dingy establishment ever again. i don't care how quick & cheap it is.

Vomg! finally! a pizza shop that doesn't charge $8 for a head of lettuce and a hand full of veggies. the food is pretty good and very affordable. \u000a\u000athe only problem i have is that my workplace puts in a $300+ order every friday and they never throw out any deals. not that they have to but it would at least show that they value and appreciate their customers' business.

Vi agree with kit's assessment - mediocre food in general, but much better than qdoba and chipotle, the only other options for mexican food nearby.\u000a\u000athe portions are pretty big - a grande quesadilla was almost too much for me to handle, and i was starving.  the sauteed veggies were a nice touch (black beans, onion & i think zucchini) but i would have liked a bit more cheese.  the mexican rice was very authentic and took me right back to a little restaurant in buenavista - pink, tasted of chicken stock, studded with peas.  the chips seemed a little stale and the salsa wasn't the greatest, but the entire meal (grande quesadilla with chips & salsa, side of rice, and a soda) was less than $7.\u000a\u000aeven though it's not great food, it's cheap and a good value.  i would definitely recommend veracruz over the chain mexican places.

Vpretty good veggie burrito\u000ai prefer chipotle because theirs feels larger and watching it being made makes it more appetizing.\u000anonetheless this tasted good and the lady at the counter was pretty nice.\u000ai did a takeout cos the seating did not look particularly welcoming.. high stools and tables.\u000athis place has got the food right, but needs to work on quantity and ambience.. and also have a printed menu which clearly marks out the vegetarian items.

Vi was a little skeptic of the pink rice but it's actually pretty good. actually, everything i've ordered has been really tasty. \u000a\u000ai have one complaint and that is the tortilla chips they give with your order. yes, they are complimentary but you get  5 and they are almost always stale. that being said, if you want chips and salsa or guacamole then walk on over to qdoba or chipotle,but if you want enchilladas or a stuffed poblano pepper, veracruz is your place!

Vi first went here about a year ago and had a very unimpressive enchilada - the experience was enough to keep me away until yesterday. having gotten tired of the tacos at nearby chipotle, i decided to give veracruz another chance. i got chicken tacos which were made quickly and came in double corn tortillas with a small bag of delicious tortilla chips. certainly not the best tacos in town, but passable! i will probably be back for more on a semi regular basis.

Vwho wants to go to the hospital?  yay!  well, not me!  okay, so that makes me a kill-joy!  as i said in my review of magee women's hospital, no one really wants to go.  but when you do have to go, it's good to know that you will receive excellent care.\u000a\u000ai was in the er here recently as an outpatient.  i wiped out on my bicycle (yes, i was wearing my helmet!) and sprained my ankle.*  i was taken to the er here, and even though i had a bit of wait--i was not a life or death case--i received respectful, kind care from the staff here.  people who work in an er are under a lot of stress, but everyone here was wonderful from the nurse to the doctor to the x-ray technician.\u000a\u000athe follow-up care was good too.  i spent a week on crutches, then i was given the boot after my first follow-up visit.  they referred me to a sports-medicine therapist and gave me suggested exercises to do.  i went last week to check the progress and the doctor was pleased with the healing process.\u000a\u000aupmc hospitals have given me great care throughout the years.\u000a\u000a*please read my review on "kindness" about the nice couple who came to my aid.

Vi don't pay enough attention to how much dry-cleaning and alterations "should" cost.  so it's hard for me to compare.  but generally, i feel like this place does decent, yet slightly overpriced work.  but they're right around the corner, so i would rather pay a few extra bucks and not have to hunt down a different place.\u000a\u000athey've never ruined or messed anything up.  sometimes my alterations have come back a tiny bit shorter than i expected them to be, but that's not consistent.  i've seen the same guy over at irene's, so maybe he does work for her too.

Vthis is one of the larger dry cleaners in pittsburgh.  they also have a location in shadyside, i believe.  they are pretty reliable here.  i've gotten my clothes back and my husband's clothes back on time.  the dry cleaning has been good.  the tailoring and altering is also good.

Vten thousand villages is like no other shopping destination in squirrel hill. certainly, it is like no other place you will shop at (i believe it is a national chain). it is best described as a "fair trade store". so, what is a "fair trade store"? per the website, they "build long-term relationships with artisans that are based on mutual understanding and respect. fair trade enables artisans to earn a fair wage and provides the opportunity for a better quality of life." in other words, they sell stuff that is not sourced by sweatshops! you won't find anything that walmart sells here. i recently bought a beautiful tapestry suede handbag from india here. i paid only $38.00 for it. that is the same as a handbag from macy's or even target would cost and made in china by some 11 year-old. i wear vintage clothing sometimes, particularly when playing in my band, and the bag goes equally well with vintage or contemporary wear. i also bought some really elegant mirrored bangles. men, you can find good things here too. my husband rick bought a very nice wallet here for only about twenty bucks and it's lasted him a couple of years! and for his birthday a couple of years ago, his parents bought him a very nice cotton messenger bag. i really love to come in here and browse. there are so many wonderful things here, rick and i couldn't possibly fit them in our condo. their prices are comparable to macy's and boscovs and if more people bought fair trade, or vintage, we could put an end to sweatshop sourced goods.

Vmy cousin cindy and i decided to spend a sunday shopping in squirrel hill.  why go to a mall when there are so many interesting shops on forbes and murray avenues?  as you can tell from my previous review, i am absolutely a fan of ten thousand villages.  i like that their merchandise is fair trade, made by artisans paid decent wages and not produced by sweat shops.\u000a\u000awith the return of warmer weather, we both were wearing halter tops, which meant our tattoos were showing.  one of the store clerks complimented me on my freshly re-inked tattoo.  she recommended this darling pair of floral bead earrings, hand made in india, to compliment my tat.  i also bought a lovely green frosted bead necklace with matching bracelt and earrings.  cindy bought some gorgeous layered spiral earrings and a beautiful embossed metal bracelet for herself.  we almost forgot the reason we went there in the first place--to look for a birthday gift for her husband.  and we found one!  her husband loves backgammon and has long wanted a nice set, so she bought one--a beautiful handmade board from peru.\u000a\u000ayou know, many people think that buying fair trade = more expensive.  wanna know something?  that's bs!  you can avoid sweatshop-produced goods and still not bust your budget.  sure, they have some $$$$ items here, but each of the jewelry items we bought were less than $20.00 each and the backgammon set was less than $50.00.

Vupdate #2.\u000a\u000ain the waning hours of my friend catherine's visit, we decided to stop in at ten thousand villages.  being from chicago, catherine has been to the one in evanston, il.  but she said that this one is much better.  we were looking at the jewelry, and as she had noticed that i had my tattoo re-inked, she found this lovely pair of serpentine teardrop earrings from peru.  well she bought that as a gift for me, knowing how well i like earrings and how well they went with my skin tone and my renovated tattoo!  that was a wonderful gift from her.  and i reciprocated with a blue art deco beaded bracelet for her.\u000a\u000anow when my friend robin visits me next, we'll have to hit this place.

Vten thousand villages has a philosophy that i totally support. i'm all about the three "r"s (reduce, reuse, recycle), sustainability, fair trade (not "free" trade), and dignity and fair wages for workers. ten thousand villages sells a lot of imported goods, but they are not sweatshop sourced. like i said in my previous reviews you can find a lot of great things here for not much more than what you'd pay at a big box retailer or at macy's. \u000a\u000ai needed a couple of supplies for my office and i found a neat little earth-friendly magazine holder. this is made by the women's multipurpose cooperative in baguio city, philippines out of--guess what--strips of recycled magazines and newspapers! and it's a tax-deductable business expense too! my husband rick saves his train magazines--wonder if he'd like one. \u000a\u000ai also bought a gorgeous pair of eco-bead earrings. see, i've got chestnut brown hair and a green tattoo on my back and i need jewelry to compliment both! \u000a\u000aand for you guys and girls looking for something for the guy in your lives, don't worry. they have plenty of men's items too. i've bought stuff like wallets, board games, office supplies, etc, for my hubby, my bro, and my dad here. \u000a\u000ai should also mention that on november 6, 2010 they will be doing a festival sale global marketplace at the shadyside presbyterian church, 5121 westminster place, pittsburgh, pa 15232.

V"fair trade, not free trade" is my motto. i may not be the world's greatest economist, but from what i've seen folks, there's nothing "free" about free trade. as i've mentioned in my previous reviews, ten thousand villages has a philosophy that i totally support, including  sustainability, and dignity and fair wages for workers. ten thousand villages sells a lot of imported goods, but they are not sweatshop sourced.\u000a\u000ai came in here today looking for some autumn items, and possibly something for a business trip i have to take next week.  oh and maybe some ideas for the upcoming christmas season.  well it was one of those cases in which i didn't find what i came in for, but i found something else!  i found some lovely sandalwood, jasmine, and mango soaps from india.  these soaps all use palm oil grown on local plantations. this palm oil provides work to local farmers and does not contribute to deforestation. \u000a\u000aten thousand villages demonstrates that affordable goods need not be equated with poverty wages, horrific working conditions, pollution, or child labor.

V.  \u000a\u000ai went into ten thousand villages with no particular agenda in mind.  no idea what i was looking for and no idea if i'd find anything at all.  now you've heard me extoll the virtures of ttv before--how they're a fair trade, not a free trade store and how their products are not only environmentally friendly, they help artisans around the world enrich their lives by earning non-sweatshop wages.  i did buy some lovely cinnamon spice soaps and a body care kit, both from artisans working for palam rural centre ("people's association for leather and allied manufacturing") in tamil nadu, india.  per their website, "...with money from product sales, palam has purchased land and homes for artisans and built a school for artisans' children. other artisan benefits include health care and retirement pensions. palam artisans see education of their children as the key to hope and change. through this work, palam rural centre is providing dignity and security to artisans and helping to break down caste walls in society."\u000a\u000aten thousand villages sells socially responsible goods that are really useful.  check 'em out sometime.

Vi wanted to like this place - i miss good chinese (or taiwanese, i grew up with it all) food!  i am not as impressed with this restaurant as other people seem to be, but that may be because my mother cooks better food.  it's just ok.

Vcan't say i agree with the "authentic" claims that other people have made for this place.  while it has some of the more palatable chinese food i've had in pittsburgh so far, it was not a meal that i felt satisfied the unbearable ache i've been feeling in my stomach for good chinese food that i've had since moving here from california.\u000a\u000afor one thing, no authentic taiwanese breakfast.  \u000a\u000afor another thing, ma po tofu, in my recollection, involves not only tofu but also minced pork.  we got some tofu floating in a sea of thick sauce that was... not... ma po... tofu...\u000a\u000acurry over rice was pretty good.  again, i'm not saying that place is bad.  but seriously folks.  this isn't authentic chinese food.

Vrose tea cafe has truly gone down the tubes since the days i was in college, when it first opened. i remember the hype of "the first good bubble tea place in pittsburgh" and it really did live up to being just that. then i would come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup, rice with braised pork, rice with pork chops, sausage fried rice, etc. and leave pretty happy. \u000a\u000abut no longer. i came here this past week (nov 2008) and was very much disappointed. perhaps if i came without the expectation of it being pretty good, i might have given this place 3 stars. but, the let down is not forgivable and i fear that i will opt never to come back here again. and to think, i used to rave about this place to other people?!! the food was excessively oily, with no distinguishable flavors except salt and soy sauce. the service was pretty pathetic too. besides the employees, i think i only saw one other table of chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant. that should've tipped me off in the first place!\u000a\u000aso, please do not call this place authentic taiwanese food. ugh, the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke.

Vrose tea cafe use to be a lot better when i first started going there.  it has gone downhill ever since with decreased quality, decreased portions, and increased prices.  the only things i would get there now are only select items off its taiwanese/chef special section: stir fried chinese watercress, short ribs w/ black pepper, eggplant w/ pork, and country style spareribs.  their taiwanese chunk chicken is decent but way overpriced, their pork intestine dishes are pretty good, but also ridiculously overpriced.  rose tea cafe is the only place (that i know of) in pittsburgh that offers stinky tofu, but i'd rather wait until i can travel to another city or country where there its better.  i would not touch the items off their front page daily meal specials unless i don't have a large appetite and also want a bubble tea, as there is a $1 discount off bubble teas with the meal special.\u000a\u000ait is definitely worth trying, but not worth putting into a restaurant rotation.

Vone of the best restaurants i've been to in the pittsburgh area. friendly service, nice atmosphere, excellent food, and reasonable prices. their chicken noodle soup is hands down the best i've ever had (great when you have a cold!), and the shrimp lo mein is to die for. rose tea also has a huge selection of bubble tea drinks which have been (mostly) to my liking.

Vrose tea's gone even more downhill since the last time i've reviewed it (is that even possible?)  my last visit to rose tea was around two weeks ago and it was only because chaya was closed for the week (we found out after we got to chaya's front steps).\u000a\u000afood just isn't good anymore.  i got their braised pork belly b/c well, i love pork belly and it's pretty damn hard to mess up.  it tasted as if the pork belly was boiled in water and then topped with the "braising liquid".  come to think of it, everything kinda tastes like the ingredients are all precooked and then thrown together like they do at orient express.\u000a\u000amy expectations as a whole weren't high to begin with after the years of quality deterioration, but come on rose tea, don't break my heart like that, i bruise like a peach...

Vrose tea cafe has fantastic bubble tea. the food is good, but not extraordinary, but portions are generous, and service is fast.\u000a\u000ain sum, while there are better taiwanese restaurants in pittsburgh, rose tea cafe is worth the trip for the bubble tea alone.

Vbetter than lulu's but still just average. yummy bubble tea gives this establishment a slight edge over its competitors. given the option between rose tea and zaw's, i would choose zaw's any day of the week.

Vi've gotten takeout from here once, and also came in for lunch one day, so i think i can safely call this four-star food.  when we got take out, the only thing i can remember for sure that we ordered was the shredded beef with chinese hot pepper, and it was spicy!  i remember we needed a lot of beverage along with that one.  we really liked it though, and i remember it was fresh-tasting compared to most take-out.\u000a\u000awhen i came in for lunch, i arrived right when they open for the day (i want to say 1130 am on a monday).  i was really excited to have bubble tea, but they said it wasn't available yet - they have to make the tapioca pearls, or let them cool, or something like that.  bummer!  but i can't argue with that, i don't want hot, malformed bubbles in my tea.  so wait an hour after they open if you want boba.\u000a\u000athe menu was huge, and descriptionless, so it's pretty hard to figure out what you want.  just take a guess.  i went for the ma po spicy bean curd, which is vegetarian (although i think, traditionally, there is also meat in the dish).  the portion was massive, both hot in temperature and spice level.  the beautiful steaming bowl was filled with soft, almost creamy tofu, and vegetables (frozen ones) swimming in sauce.  i have to say, it was pretty darn good.  i didn't even miss the meat or wish that the vegetables hadn't come from a bag.  there was so much food, i ate ma po tofu for nearly three meals.  it's a bargain.  the server was very nice too, prompt and helpful.\u000a\u000acan't wait to come back, try more things on the menu, and get bubble tea!

Vhmmm, i'm on the fence deciding whether or not i'll give engel's 3 1/2 or four stars.  it's a neat little produce shop near the south end of the murray avenue strip.  it's one of my go to places after the citipark's farmer's market season ends.  the fruits and veggies here are of better quality than what you get at giant eagle.

Vmy husband and i do most of our grocery shopping at this giant eagle.  not too much to it.  how can you get excited about a grocery store?  we buy most of our staples here, although we buy most of our meat and produce in the strip district.

Vi know it's bratty to move to a new town and complain about your neighborhood store, but i am not a fan of this giant eagle.  i mean, a+ for convenience (two blocks from my apartment), but that's nearly all it gets points for.  it's so small!  quite expensive, i noticed, and the "giant eagle card" doesn't end up saving you much money anyway.  i think we'll try to only go here for brand items (cheerios, etc) but get produce/meat/seafood/everything else in the strip district.  still, two stars for being open 24 hours and for being right there when i need something for dinner last minute.  and for the "local produce" being sold out front - it's actually pretty cheap!  much cheaper than the produce inside the store.

Vwhere to begin?\u000a\u000ai used to frequent this ge when i lived in sq. hill, i wish i had known about the greenfield location back then. let me tell you the employees suck (for lack of better terminology) no matter what time you go. i would go early in the morning after getting off night shift and the younger cashiers would all be standing around talking or on their phones and the older ones are just standing around reading magazines or looking miserable. and the night crew isn't much better. 2 out of the 3 are nice but the shrewd bald man is horrendous. i don't like to talk negatively about people but man, this guy is a piece of work. he yells at customers, tells them where to put things to make his job easier, never makes eye contact, i've never heard him say hello or thank you let alone see him smile. if someone is so unhappy with their job do everyone a favor and find something else. where are the managers? i used to manage while in college and if my employees were this unproductive and lazy, they wouldn't have a job. \u000a\u000aenough about the staff, let's talk about the store. the shelves are well stocked most of the time and they have a decent selecton of goods. the produce section isn't the best, however it is nice that they have locally grown produce in the summer time.

Vargh, you dirty little cramped place you.  if you wasn't for your late hours (until 1-ish) and proximity to where i live, i wouldn't frequent you.  \u000a\u000ai'm so confused when i shop here.  do you remember that kid's game show "fun house?"  it's kind of like walking into that.  having to look for a clue as to where to find the item you want/need.  i swear i walked around for 15 minutes once looking for the bread aisle only to discover that the bread was on the ends of several aisles (your clue) and you had to figure out which endcap you needed for the correct bread.\u000a\u000agoing later at night makes it hard to shop, especially since they are in full swing with restocking the shelves.  (yet another piece to that fun house puzzle)  don't go for big orders ever here, be sure to have a small list and avoid grabbing a cart, you'll just add to the congestion.  if at all possible, use the self check outs.

Vi haven't been back to color me mine in 6 years or so, but i have fond memories of it. for those who don't know, it is a paint your own pottery place. the service is okay, the weekly specials (you'll have to check them out to find out what they are now) are usually a much better deal, and the whole thing is just kind of fun. i used to go when i was a college student, so my complaint and reason for the 3 stars is that it's an expensive stress reliever. you can go occasionally, but it's not somewhere you'd go regularly just because the costs add up so easily.\u000a\u000athey typically charge you for the number of hours you paint, and then you pay for whatever piece you decide to paint. the selection is okay, i've seen better at other (also expensive) places. like i said, the costs add up. if you're willing to splurge, this is a good place to have a couple of hours of relaxing fun.

Vi love panera in general, but this location isn't the best. i've tried to get dinner past 6 pm several times and they've been out of necessary ingredients. also, the local high school (?) hoodlums tend to frequent this location. try the one in oakland or at the waterfront instead.

Vi was sorry to see this panera bread close.  it was so close to my house--right around the corner in fact.  yes there are a lot of great local places in squirrel hill and i always prefer patronizing locally-owned businesses.  still, for an impromptu lunch out with my girlfriends and/or my cousin, it wasn't a bad choice.  and i did like their breads.\u000a\u000ai also liked their soups, including low fat chicken noodle and low fat vegetarian black bean.  oh well, i guess i can always go to the one in homestead.

Vmy husband rick and i took the car here last night for an oil change.  it's a decent enough place, if all you need is an oil change.  i've been coming here since i was single and living in greenfield.  the service is generally fast and friendly enough.  the good thing is that they are open relatively late, until 8pm on weeknights.  so us 9-5 working stiffs can come here!

Vit's close to my house, easy and in the middle of the day, with about 5 people in front of me, they did change my oil in about 10-15 minutes. friendliness of the staff could improve but it was well enough, i couldn't right away guess where to drive my car to get service but figured it out eventually.

Vi took our chevy malibu here the other day for a routine oil change.   i've been coming here since my 20s when i lived in the neighborhood.  it's a decent enough place.  they get you in and out pretty quickly and they don't overdo it on the upselling.

Vi've had good and bad service here. the price for an oil change is about $40 after tax. i've come once and it took, from the time of pulling off of beechview into the lot, an hour an a half to get a change. last time was only a few minutes. if you don't have the space/tools to do a change or you don't want to hassle with the oil disposal, it's an alright place to go for a change.\u000a\u000asometimes my car is dirty when i get back in it. i don't know why someone would want to eat a sandwich and change oil at the same time.

Vwow! too bad i don't have a turntable! 'cos this place specializes in vinyl. they have records, records, and more records.  me, i have a huge cd collection.  i don't believe in mp3 players (because if you only have songs downloaded, you don't really have a music collectiom, do you?).  there are some purists who believe that the best sound is on vinyl and my father is one of them.  \u000a\u000ato back up a moment, my husband rick was out of town for the day on one of his railfan jaunts.  so my brother paul and i decided to get together, hang out, and maybe get a little christmas shopping out of the way.  dad likes music as much as we do,  he even likes more current bands like arcade fire and snow patrol.  we decided that some used lps would make a big splash with the old man.  on an earlier family visit, i pilfered his record and cd collection while paul created a diversion.\u000a\u000awe decided upon getting him "damn the torpedos" from tom petty & the heartbreakers and a rare lp by the busboys.  man, i have got to get me a turntable!  this place is awesome and i could spend hours in here.  now isn't shopping and browsing at a place like this way more fun than amazon or e-bay?

Vjerry's sells non-recent music on vinyl, either used or collectible.\u000a\u000ai've known djs from nyc who took bookings to pittsburgh simply for the excuse to go to here.  you can spend hours in this store.\u000a\u000athey have more records than any other record store i've had the luck to see.   more of their records are things you'd actually want to buy.  their prices are cheap.  their staff is friendly.\u000a\u000afor what they do, i've never seen better.

Vi'm not all that big on middle eastern/lebanese cuisine.  still, as another poster says, aladdin's provides a nice change of pace if you are looking for more than meat-n-potatoes.  i've brought out-of-town guests here and they have loved it.\u000a\u000ai have a couple of favorites here.  i really like the mediterranean grilled lamb plate, which is marinated lamb strips with rice and vermicelli.  i prefer it with garlic sauce instead of yogurt.  another dish i like is the grilled turkey salad.  the turkey is turkey breast and not formed, pressed turkey.  it also has olives, mixed greens, and cucumbers.  \u000a\u000abeverages include pop, smoothies, and juices, however i recommend trying the mint tea.  it has a nice, soothing quality about it.  surprisingly, they have an interesting selection of red wines and indeed they extol the virtues of red wine!  the beer selection is a little on the skimpy side though, being mainly budweiser or bud lite.  i'm basically a non-drinker but every so often i do like some vino.\u000a\u000aso in short, this is not a place i'd eat at everyday.  but it does make a nice change of pace.

Vthe food is good, but not any better than the med grill nearby.  the desserts are great, but not any better than gullifty's, around the corner on murray.  the vegetarian options are great to see.\u000a\u000abut instead of three or four stars, it's a strong two.  i've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant i've been to in the entire city. \u000a\u000amy guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full.  if someone convinces me they fixed the problem with the speed, i'd gladly head back, but until then, they've burned through my goodwill.

Vthis place is very nice--the restaurant is clean, they have an extensive menu and everything we tried here was good.\u000a\u000awe started with some of their house-brewed mint tea, which was hot and delicious.  we also had pita strips with hummus and roll-ups--my husband had chicken and garlic, mine was falafel with baba (eggplant) and both were delicious.  i was so full after dinner that i couldn't try dessert.\u000a\u000anext time i will save room--they have probably 30 varieties of cake and cheesecake that all looked amazing!

Vwe came back for round two, this time we both ordered entree salads which were fresh, crisp, and delicious.  the dressings are homemade, light, perfect!  i love the aladdin's dressing--it's mostly olive oil and lemony.\u000a\u000athis time we got dessert which was so, so good.  neapolitan cheesecake for me and peanut butter mousse cake for the hubby although we ended up sharing...both were awesome! extra stars!  :d

Valaddin's is a chain, but you'd never know it. the food is prepared fresh, and is very good. i particularly like the hummus and would recommend the pizzas, as well.\u000a\u000aone of the best things about aladdin's, though, is that the price is very reasonable considering the quality.

Vmy girlfriends and i came here before having a chick's night at the flicks.  we figured why not have some lebanese chow before seeing an italian film.\u000a\u000awe started our meals with loubie bzeit for our appetizer.  green beans sauteed with onions, herbs, large whole cloves of garlic (mmmm!  kiss me rick, darling!).  since i like the basics, i had the chicken vegetable soup.  to tell you the truth, i prefer chicken noodle any day of the week.  i had my usual here, the grilled turkey salad.  \u000a\u000aaladdin's still isn't my first choice for dining out, but it is a nice change of pace from your standard burger joint.

Valaddin's is a franchise with almost 30 locations in a few different states.  still, as evidenced by all the accolades on the wall, the food is better than what you'd expect from a chain.  my boyfriend grew up eating at aladdin's in cleveland with his family, so he was excited to have a location near our apartment in pittsburgh.  he came home the other day raving about their spicy kafta rolled pita, so when we needed a quick dinner on saturday night, we decided to turn to them for takeout.\u000a\u000athey have very convenient online ordering, which was great, and there is no fee for it.  you get a free hummus with your first online order, so that was delightful.  the only thing to remember is that after your first online order, you have to call the restaurant and confirm it - you just need to do it the first time, i guess so they can make sure you are a real person or something.  they told us to be there to pick up the food in 20.\u000a\u000awe were there on time and our food was ready.  we had our free hummus, some falafel, a lentil soup, the chicken sambusek, and the mediterranean lamb.  we were hungry, as you can see.  everything was clearly well-made and very flavorful - the only downside was that none of it was....warm.  i think the food might've been ready about 10 minutes before we picked it up.  so i guess i'd wish they'd been a little more accurate in their estimate of how long the food would take to cook.\u000a\u000abesides the temperature, the food was really tasty.  the falafel had great flavor, though it wasn't quite as soft on the inside and crispy on the outside as i'd have liked (sababa's falafel is still my ideal!)  the lentil soup was very mild, but restorative.  it was so fresh, light, and lovely.  my boyfriend wasn't a big fan of the hummus - i'm not sure what it was that bothered him, maybe the stronger tahini taste?  i thought it was fine though.\u000a\u000athe chicken samusek was really interesting - flavorful, almost smoky chicken wrapped in a pita.  the lamb was delicious also, served over the most lovely cinnamon rice.  but again, the temperature - it affected the taste and the texture of the meat.  sigh.\u000a\u000ai really think this is a 4-star place, we just had a 3-star experience this one time.  i'm sure we'll order from there again and maybe we'll show up early to pick up our food, or dine-in!

Vthis is another time when i wish yelp's rating system would allow half stars.  i'd gladly bump up my review to 3.5.  believe me, places like aladdin's serve a need.\u000a\u000alike last night (december 23rd).  i came home from work.  i was all done with christmas shopping.  i was tired from all this holiday michigas.  husband rick was out doing the last of his christmas shopping.  i thought, "what better time to order some take-out, plop my butt down on the couch, and eat while watching some tv?".  hey, tbs shows "seinfeld" reruns during dinner time!\u000a\u000aso i had me some len-chili soup--chili with lentils-for a starter.  for my main course i ordered the chicken sambusek plate:  a pita with curry chicken, onions, peas, and spices.  my sides included mixed green veggies, tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives.\u000a\u000aall in all, it was a good way to chow down after tying my hair up and slipping into my comfy old sweatpants.

Vi think i found my friendly neighborhood cheap chinese restaurant!  (fyi: the sign on the awning says china star, but the menu says yen's and they say yen's when they pick up the phone.  not sure of the reason for the discrepancy.)\u000a\u000athe previous tenant of my apartment left the menu lying around, and last night we were desperate for dinner so we decided to check them out.  two vegetable spring rolls and two entrees cost less than $20 and were ready to pick up in 10 minutes.  (delivery would have taken 40 minutes even though we live half a mile away.)  my boyfriend picked up the food and said the place seemed very clean.\u000a\u000athe spring rolls were good and crispy.  the vegetable fried rice had more than the requisite peas and carrots - there were mushrooms, corn, and even zucchini, which i don't think i've ever had in chinese food but it was pretty good.  the mongolian beef was not just a pile of beef - there were plenty of onions and green onions to add color and texture.  portion sizes were more than adequate and we both had leftovers.\u000a\u000athe best part is the price.  the only entrees over $10 are the ones with seafood.  all of the lunches (with rice and soup) are under $5!  (except for the ones with shrimp, which are $5.25 - still a good deal if you ask me.)\u000a\u000ai would definitely recommend yen's if you live in the neighborhood - it looks shady from the outside but i thought the food was better than silk pagoda's.

Vperhaps i was being just a bit unfair in my review of--wow--five years ago.  on its own merits, this starbucks is a pretty nice place.  oh sure, parking is a bit limited and seating is a bit tight.\u000a\u000abut i was meeting my mom here before heading over to the manor for a movie.  because we both walked here at a non-busy time, the parking and seating weren't issues.\u000a\u000aoverall i'd give this starbucks a 3.5 star rating.

Vyeah, so buying beer in the state of pennsylvania is a shit experience.  why, why, why, why can't they just sell the beer in the liquor stores?   i don't understand that at all.  \u000a\u000aanyway, i was parked, in, and out with a case of black lager and a blue moon brewmaster's sampler in asap, so i'm a happy camper.  i would be happier if going out to buy beer wasn't like a full day's errand, but that's pa's fault, not save-mor's.

Vim like a kid in a candy store every time i come here! they have everything you expect to find and other goodies such as cases of delicious micro brews, lindemanns framboise, and other imported gems. the store is sectioned off by snacks and sodas/energy drinks, seasonal, country of origin, state of origin, chilled, and el cheapo cases. its always well stocked and the cashiers are pretty cool. if i ask about a new beer i want to try they tell me what they think or have heard about it. prices are decent and they always have sales.

Vsave-mor beer, you make the ridonkulous pa liquor laws slightly tolerable.  they carry my beloved abita brand, and have a huge selection of many other local, national and international breweries. there's a walk- in cooler section with your normal beers, nothing fancy in there though.\u000aplus, their commercial can't be beat!

Veasy in and out beer store.  prices are the usual for any type of store like the such.  there is a cooler section if you are looking for something already cooled...convenient!\u000a\u000astaff is very laid back.\u000a\u000abest part is, they still have the doors you have to stand on the mat to open.

Vtwo and a half stars.  it's nice to see that this wendy's is still open.  when i lived in greenfield, my friends and i would come here a couple of times a month.  i've always liked wendy's better than mcdonald's or burger king--but that ain't sayin' much.   i'd always order off the value menu because i liked a baked potato and butter (instead of fries) and a side salad with my burger.  \u000a\u000ai've only been back here on rare occasion since i got married, but when i do, i still like the value menu.

Vah, the cogo's of my 20s.  i was living at velma courts nearby, from the time i moved out on my own until i got married in 2004.  this cogo's was an old reliable whenever i needed milk or a newspaper or candy (i need a supply of the sweet stuff on hand in case my bgs go low).  an evening walk in the summertime to simply get a diet pop was always pleasant too.\u000a\u000ai really haven't been this way on beechwood boulevard in awhile, so i don't know how the place is today.  it's still there and hopefully as friendly and as convenient as i remember it.

Vjust your average neighborhood convenience store/gas station. has what you need if you're on the go. i actually found indian brand pumpkin seeds for a quarter here! i loved those tiny seeds of salty goodness when i was younger. two major cons: gas is almost always cheaper at the sunoco headed toward homestead and the air pump is out of service more often than not.\u000a\u000aafter midnight you have to be buzzed in.

Vi have the worst luck with automobiles and therefore mechanics as well, until i stumbled upon homer's. they are friendly and honest. i was once quoted a price and when i went to pick up my car, it was $100 cheaper. i believe that if the same situation occurred elsewhere, they would have just taken my money and not said a thing. i've been going to homer's for 2 years and never had a shady experience.

Vhomer's has met all of my auto maintenance/inspection needs since we moved to pittsburgh a year ago, and i've never looked back.  they are considerate and honest, and the prices are reasonable given the good work that they do.  interestingly - the one time i had to go to another shop (penn automotive) - because my car was damaged and state farm recommended them - the penn automotive guy offered to do my 30,000 mile maintenance while i was there, and i said i normally got that done at homer's.  the penn automotive guy said "well, never mind.  i don't want to take business away from those guys - they are great."  how about that?  a rave review from their own competition?

Vwith my recent car inspection overdue by a day i frantically was looking for a reliable place to get it in and inspected as soon as possible.  i have heard of homer's quite a lot from a friend and how reliable they are.  so i took a chance, called them near closing of the day and they were able to squeeze me in first thing in the morning.  \u000a\u000ai decided to wait for my car to be done and it took less than a hour to have it in, inspected and back out.  didn't try to 'find' something wrong with it to pinch some more money out of me.  \u000a\u000ai can't say thank you enough for being able to get me in last minute, how fast they were able to do it and how polite they are to you.

Vnow this is a place that does pizza properly!  a little greasy yes, but that's to be expected.  it is the new york style pizza and, sorry to my chicago friends (and yes i do like chicago style pizza), it is the kind where you can fold each slice.\u000a\u000ait is close to the shops and bus line and its a great deal. the special can't be beat-- two new york slices and a drink for under 4 dollars!  i come here with the hubby or some of my friends and we sometimes split the special.

Vi've recently moved to pittsburgh and have eaten a lot of delivery lately.  this is the first good pizza delivery i've had in 2 weeks.  the pizza was thin, but not too crispy.  the topping choices are basic, but pretty tasty.  for example, the bacon topping was actually strips of bacon and not weird bacon-like crumbles.  the garden salad had plenty of toppings, which was appreciated since they use plain-jane iceberg lettuce.  i think this place will stay in my food rotation!

Vthis is the only acceptable pizza i've eaten in pittsburgh. having tried 11 other pizza places in delivery range of oakland, there is no contest. when i feel nostalgic for a ny slice ivp is the only viable solution.

Vok, this is one of the only two acceptable pizzas i've eaten in pittsburgh now. pizza sola in oakland makes a slice of comparable, if slightly lower, quality. ivp has much more ny hole in the wall (smaller, grungier) charm. easily beats out mineo's.\u000a\u000aone issue, when i've ordered delivery, especially in large batches, quality has sunk a ton. (soggier crust, no burnt cheese on top.)i think it gains something from sitting out a while before being reheated.

Vok, tasted better than vocelli and cost less.  plus, how can you not love a place that has a "ranch lover's" special.  it came with two cups of ranch!  i do love ranch!  the delivery did take a while, but it was friday night and i can wait for my ranchstravaganza, that just gives me more appetite to down more ranch-dunked slices!

V"now allison, is that anyway to eat a slice of pizza?"  i asked my niece.  imagine, she was about to use a knife and fork on a piece of thin crust!  what are parents teaching these young'uns nowadays?  "don't you know that's not the right way to do it?"  i asked.\u000a  "it's not?"  my niece asked in reply.\u000a  "no.  you have to take your slice, fold it over, and eat it with your hands thusly".  \u000a  "ohhh!"  allison said as she understood.\u000a  "now isn't it more fun to eat your pizza this way?"  i asked.\u000a\u000aah yes, so goes another aunt-niece bonding moment!  she asked me to take her over to the carnegie library and we thought we'd have a little lunch first.  italian village still has awesome pizza and the great thing is you can order by the slice.  they've also got a great deal--two slices of pizza and a 16oz pop for only $3.75.  so not only did we not have to schlep around half an eaten pizza, but allison could order what she wanted.  she simply went for cheese and sausage. me, i went for the spinach and ham.  mmmm good pizza and good times!

Vgod help me, i really like this pizza. they don't have any of the fancy toppings i love, and they're a chain. i mean, this place is a favorite for children, children! but i cannot help myself. i love this pizza. \u000a\u000athe wings, on the other hand, are abysmal. there is possibly nothing grosser than wings with gelatinous skin. fry them! no person, ever, wants to eat chicken with slimy, pale chicken skin.

Vthe food is edible, especially when my standards were lower as a college student, but i wouldn't order from there anymore. it's your normal take-out chinese place, so you would think that it could get at least 2 stars. let's just say they get 2 stars for food, but 0 for cleanliness, so it averages out to a 1 star rating.\u000a\u000ai actually have an awful story about this place, but it's too disgusting to share publicly. if you want to know, i'd be happy to share privately, but i won't take any responsibility for your upchuck reflexes.

Voverly greasy chinese take out. there are much better options in the area so please check those (rose tea cafe, ka mei, zaw's, new dumpling house, sun penang - just to name a few) first.\u000a\u000asome co-workers and i ordered from here on easter, as it was one of the only places open. no one was happy with their order. comments ranged from "ehh, i've had better" to "gross". my hot & sour soup was congealed and disgusting.

Vthey need to start a completely fresh yelp page for how lee!  i'm not sure if they're under new ownership, or they just finally got their act together, but how lee is delicious and fresh now!  the inside is completely renovated, and it's always packed.  they have all your usual suspects on the menu, along with a good amount of schezuan specialties.  the chendu chicken and double cooked pork  belly are tasty, and the hot & sour soup and spring rolls are good too.

Vanother week, another squirrel hill chinese restaurant to try.  seriously, there's practically one for every week of the year.  how lee was our choice because we had an allmenus coupon code for $10 off, so that was essentially a free entree.  sold!  we ordered a scallion pancake, which i haven't had in years and was essentially dreaming about all this time, the triple  szechuan delight (shrimp, beef, vegetables in "brown sauce"), and chicken fried rice because we're cool.\u000a\u000awhen we went to pick it up, the place was packed.  lots of asian families eating big pots of delicious looking food, and lots of white people standing around waiting for take out.  sounds like this is one of those places with an american menu, and a chinese menu.  we are pretty adventurous eaters typically, but since this was our first time at how lee, we figured we'd start simple.  we waited about 10 more minutes after getting there, and i had to fight through the crowds to get to the front to pick up my food.  so it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd i'm not surprised.\u000a\u000awe took the food home, and nommed it.  i loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and i've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  yum!  fried rice was okay - i've had it better at other places (i think i liked it a lot at pacific ring).  my boyfriend really liked the szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.  portions were big and lasted us for several meals.\u000a\u000amaybe next time we'll try something a little more adventurous, and hopefully be rewarded with deliciousness!

Vthis is my go to place for takeout chinese. they do americanized chinese food quite well, and they're always friendly and quick. i wish i could read their chinese menu, though. the food that they prepare in restaurant off that menu (not the takeout english one) looks and smells absolutely amazing. if you know how to ask for it, do it!

Vthe hubster and i finally made it in here to make a comparison between china star and how lee. the service here is incredibly friendly and accommodating, and they clearly are used to dealing with english speaking clientele.\u000a\u000asurprisingly, the servers were cantonese. i liked this because i could speak with them without much trouble, but this is where i thought the food might have been a bit lacking. we got our usual, which is fish fillets in spicy broth and pea shoots. the pea shoots were a bit on the tough side (might just have been due to what was available) and we were able to get the fish fillets a bit more mild than usual. maybe getting it mild was where we went wrong - sad to say, but the fish fillets at china star are significantly better. allow me to explain just a bit - the fish fillet dish at how lee's was a bit ... cantonesed (i.e., they had thickened up the soup base with corn starch, which is a pretty typical cantonese thing to do). also, the fish fillets were a bit on the doughy side, which i think probably had everything to do with the fish they used. \u000a\u000aanyway, this is not a crazy indictment - it was still really good chinese food, especially by pittsburgh standards. i especially liked it because i could actually speak with the servers. but if you're looking for really authentic szechuan food, i'd recommend china star over this.

Vyet another place that i'd not been to even though it's practically around the corner from me.  i'd been working around the house on a friday morning and i decided to get some take-out for lunch.\u000a\u000ai ordered the chicken with mixed vegetables and it made for a tasty, satisfying lunch.  the chicken was tender and the vegetables weren't mushy.  my hot and sour soup was so good on an otherwise *icky* day.\u000a\u000ahow lee is a typical chinese neighborhood joint with the usual weekday lunch specials (i.e. with choice of rice and soup). i think that if you tick to the basics at a place like this, you can't go wrong.

Vthis is our go-to pizza shop in sqhill.  their prices are great, and they always have coupons.  the owner is a really terrific guy, so the good food and good ownership makes me happy to support this local business.  the wings are nice and crispy, the pizza crust is a little chewy, and the toppings are plentiful.  i suggest getting a specialty pizza (greek and mediterranean are my faves), or adding feta to a plain cheese. i haven't gotten up the fat-kid courage yet to try their chicken and buffalo fries pizza!\u000a\u000a their hoagies and gyros are good too; and they have italian dinners on the menu, but i've never tried them. do know that this is primarily a take-out and delivery establishment.

Vthis has got to be my favorite sushi place in pittsburgh.  it's small, so be early or be prepared for a wait to get a table.  or, just order to go!  the service is hit or miss, but in general good.  i think most of my problem encounters have been when i have ordered to go.  \u000a\u000athe sushi is smazing, my personal fave - the spicy tuna hand roll.  and the prices are fairly reasonable.  i've had a lot on the menu, and can't say there is anything that i wouldn't recommend.  one of the major highlights of the sushi experience here is the freshly grated horseradish/wasabi.  it makes the experience totally different from the expected wasabi paste.  please, just don't do what my mom did - not believing me in how the wasabi should be used (dip your sushi into the soy sauce that add some freshly grated horseradish onto your piece of suchi), she did what she normally does with wasabi - dumped it into her vat of soy sauce.  not a good idea - it washes out the flavor and don't expect the good stuff when asking for more wasabi.  they'll take one look, shake their head internally, and give you the cheap paste the next time round.  \u000a\u000aenjoy!!!!

Vfantastic sushi!  pricey, but worth it.  fresh fish - the toro is to die for.  the dinners have not only your usual miso soup, salad, and rice combo that comes with bento boxes, but also chicken kaarage (fried chicken).\u000a\u000avery small, so be prepared to wait.  i can't wait to come back as a regular.

Vafter nearly 4 years i've finally ventured out to chaya.  what took me so long?  i'm always mildly hesitant about seafood when i'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.\u000a\u000athree of us ordered a roll combination platter to split as well as our own food.  i ordered yellowtail cheeks, my friend ordered eel, and my last friend is boring.\u000a\u000afirst came the salad.  it was pretty standard, but any sign of vegetation is a good thing for the college male.\u000a\u000anext up was their karaage.  ohmygoodness it was the best karaage i have ever had.  now i've never had karaage in japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and i was scared it would be a letdown.  the flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  drool.\u000a\u000amiso soup was also pretty standard.\u000a\u000athe roll combination was a disappointment.  yes, we had it coming for ordering a platter of rolls, but it was only b/c the sushi/sashimi platters would have either been too big (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  in retrospect we should have just ordered a la carte nigiri...  i noticed halfway through the meal they had anago available that night too...\u000a\u000amy yellowtail cheeks were delicious.  personally i love fish cheeks (as well as the part of fish right by the tail when i order fish whole).  it's super tender and rich and tastes so delicate.\u000a\u000amy end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  i would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the roll combination and i had picked up a piece of toro and a piece of anago instead.\u000a\u000aservice was excellent and the their timing was impeccable; they have it all down to an art.  the next time i'm back i completely want to try their omakase.  in japanese it means "it's up to you" with "you" being the chef.\u000a\u000ai was slightly disappointed when i saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy sauce and completely mix it up.  that is not how sushi should be eaten.....

Vfirst taste of sushi in pittsburgh!!! and it was pretty good. this is a tiny restaurant with about 10 tables (but they are moving, so probably getting a bigger space?) the menu is huge and the sushi menu was hard to find at first because it's in a plaque on top of the table. the restaurant is byob and doesn't serve any alcohol. the service was fine, had to ask for a tea refill myself but definitely not anywhere near rude.

Vif you're looking for "bang for the buck", only want sushi (and not other japanese food), and don't mind slightly less variety, tokyo in bloomfield should be your first stop.\u000a\u000aif you're looking for the best japanese food in pittsburgh, chaya is it.  this is the best japanese restaurant i've had the chance to try.  if you like sushi, you should go here and try this.\u000a\u000aeven in the new location, there's often a wait, so don't show up starving; that said, the wait is worth it, and the food is awesome.  we've yet to find a bad pick on the menu.\u000a\u000a5-stars; as good as it gets.

Vsince we live a few blocks away from what many are calling the best sushi in pittsburgh, we felt it was our duty to try it asap!  we strolled in for a date night on a thursday around 6pm, and were seated immediately.  the restaurant is pretty small, so i'd imagine there can be quite a wait on weekends.  all the seats are pretty close together, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!  but it's not a big deal if you have a good attitude.\u000a\u000athe interior is bright, with lots of little japanese accents in the decor.  the servers wear kimonos and sandals, and were very helpful to us.  our server recommended an alternate appetizer, saying it was more popular (and, presumably better) then the one we had ordered - and she was right on the money!  also, a woman who i believe was the owner came around to check on us a few times, and she actually moved my soy sauce dish closer to my right hand, saying it would be easier for me that way.  it wasn't an intrusive gesture - it felt sort of like a kindly mother giving you a little pointer.\u000a\u000anot being interested in paying $2 per person for byob, we just had water and i had an iced green tea, which came in a can but was still very tasty.  we began with miso soup and salad, which was the standard fare that you can expect at any sushi place.  our appetizer was the "giant clam cooked in its shell" or something to that effect.  and indeed- out came a platter with a giant clam shell, with some sizzling bubbly goodness cooking inside it.  why was it sizzling?  oh, because it was on fire!  well, the clam wasn't on fire, but there was some fuel source on the plate, and there were beautiful flames licking the clam shell and making our appetizer bubble in a most delicious looking way.\u000a\u000anot only delicious looking but delicious tasting, we loved the appetizer.  the clam is cooked in some sort of spicy mayo sauce, and it was pretty darn delectable.  i was licking my plate with my finger to get all of the sauce after we had eaten all the clam pieces.  yummy!  i'd order that one again if i didn't want to try so many other things.\u000a\u000amost entrees looked expensive, so we decided to stick with sushi.  their roll selection is simple, and i'd imagine it is also traditional - no crazy rolls here, just fresh fish and vegetables prepared simply.  we enjoyed the sunrise eca roll (eel, cucumber, avocado), the mix roll (tuna, salmon, whitefish), and the tropical island roll (shrimp, tuna, avocado, and radish sprouts).  the rolls are small, just six standard size pieces, but it was plenty of food for us along with the appetizer, soup, and salad.  the sushi was very good, clearly fresh, and pleasant to eat.  the rice seemed a bit dry to me, and the presentation wasn't flashy like you see at other sushi restaurants, but it was a satisfying and highly inexpensive dinner!\u000a\u000ai think i would rather get sashimi and nigiri next time to really enjoy the quality of the fish, but the rolls were very good too.  our bill was only $30, but i know next time we will try new things and it will cost a bit more.  still, it was a lovely neighborhood restaurant with traditional, fresh food, and that's the kind of place where i'd like to return and give them more business.

Vy'know, in all the years i've lived in the neighborhood, i'd never been to this place.  indeed i think the only japanese restaurant i'd been to in pittsburgh has been kiku.  i finally tried this place the other night when my friend karen and i decided it was just too hot to go to the three rivers arts festival.\u000a\u000aso i'm not big on sushi 'cos there's just something about raw, uncooked animal flesh that doesn't set well with me.  for those of us who aren't sushi fans, they have a lot of other things on their menu and --yikes-- it can be a little pricey!  oh but it looks all so good.\u000a\u000awell i kicked off my meal with some miso soup and believe me, i enjoy a good miso soup!  whereas karen did go for the sushi, i went for the unagi kabayaki or broiled eel which was really good.  i also opted for the complete dinner which inlcuded salad, a fried chicken appetizer, and the miso soup.  as i said, some of the items on the menu are a little expensive but the complete dinner i had was only about $19.00.  i topped my dinner off with some mochi, which is green tea & red bean ice cream.\u000a\u000ajust so you know, chaya doesn't serve alcohol but they do have byob.  but i suggest you try the oolong ice tea like i did, which was very refreshing.  they also have a whole bunch of japanese soft drinks too.

Vawesome little shop, you can find just about anything you need here. very helpful staff that aren't breathing down your neck obviously watching you from the corner hoping to catch you steal sorts. go when you have time to spare, you'll lose yourself in there.

Vused cds! used dvds! what's not to like about the exchange? i know, they don't always have that rare import or hard to find, out of print album (but occasionally they get them). it's a great place to come in, browse, and bolster your music, movie, and/or video game collections. they also take used cds, dvds, and games too in exchange--hence the name. so if you have a duplicate cd or you just didn't like the dvd you received as a gift, bring 'em all in and they'll exchange them. \u000a\u000ai'm so glad places like this still exist. i'm a serious music collector and the bulk of my cd collection (300+ and still growing) was purchased used at places like this. call me old fashioned if you will, but i still like coming into music stores and browsing. i still like collecting cds and dvds. i miss the old record stores like nrm. heck, i'd even buy 33 1/3 lp records if they were more readily available (and my dad still swears by the fidelity of vinyl!).   i believe that mp3 players are fine if you want to take music with you.  but if all you have are downloads, you don't really have a music collection, do you?  and no one's gonna autograph your i-pod!\u000a\u000aokay, i got on my soapbox there for a moment.  the exchange is a great little store and they've got very friendly, knowledgable people working here.  come in and browse to your heart's content and when you find that cd or dvd you've been looking for (at a cheap price i might add), you'll remember the little joys of actually shopping for music & movies.

Vi have found a great many bargains at the exchange in squirrel hill.  i used to think that the staff were scary in a very hip/fashionable way, however i have found that when you ask them a question about the music, either they know the answer, or someone in the store who does.  they don't fake the answer, either, and often they are knowledgeable about many different genres, and about music that existed before they were born!  they have also been helpful in guiding me to a store that may have the cd i am looking for.  also, at first i did not understand the pricing, but then realized that if they have a lot of copies of a particular cd, they are often willing to sell it for less.

Vi love being able to do some spring cleaning and get paid for it.\u000a\u000acleared out a majority of the dusty dvds and some of my games for my old gamecube and the wii.  when i say a majority i mean one of those cardboard file boxes, two large plastic totes and a slender plastic tote.  all was gone through and decent amount was given to me for nicely taken care of dvd/game collection i no longer wanted.\u000a\u000astaff was friendly and accomodating.  always seem to have a smile on their face.\u000a\u000anote: if you do decide to sell items here and don't want the cash, you can get i believe 30% more if you opt for the store credit.

Vstill not much to get excited about here.  but i'm taking the day off in order to get some stuff down around the house, and brueggers is right around the corner, i thought i'd stop in & get a quick breakfast and coffee.  \u000a\u000athe egg white & sundried tomato sandwich was definitely different and it didn't have that prefab taste that some breakfast sandwiches have.  plus one star for the hot bagel they served it on.  it was s-o-o-o good on a cold late march morning (and what the !@#$ is up with this winter weather we've been having around here?  isn't baseball season supposed to be starting next week?).  coffee here is much improved, what with the green mountain coffee they're now serving here. i like that it's fair trade certified.  anyone who knows me knows my motto is "fair trade, not free trade."

Vbagels are tasty.  even chain bagels.  i personally prefer the bagel factory, but this bruegger's is ridonkulously close to my apartment, and they have coupons all over the newspaper and facebook, so it's easy to get lots of free/cheap foodz.  i have to say though, when you get a bagel and a schmear, they put a gross amount of cream cheese on.  i love cheese as much as the next person, but the cream cheese is a condiment, there is not supposed to be a 1-1 cheese to bagel ratio.  but the lady at the counter was super nice.  she said something awesome the last time i was there - like "have a peaceful day" or "have a beautiful day" or a "joyful day" or some adjective better than a "nice" day.  gotta love that!

Vi'm always up for a tasty bagel in the morning. i pop in this location after night shifts and grab a half dozen. the staff is always so cheerful and polite... kinda makes me want to hurl, how can anybody be happy to be up before the sun fully rises?? my apologies, as you can gather i am not a morning person\u000a\u000aback to the review...my favorite bagels are the jalapeo cheddar, rosemary olive oil, onion, eveything, oh let's just say i've never had a brueggers bagel i didn't like. \u000a\u000adon't leave without grabbing some fresh oj!

Vmy husband rick and i had not been to the new dumpling house in a long time.  our favorite place is actually silk pagoda for either dine-in or delivery.  but with rick having dental surgery yesterday and still recuperating (but with his appetite back!), we decided to have chinese tonight.  he still wasn't up to going out anywhere and needing to get out of the house for a few minutes, i wanted a place i could walk to.  new dumpling house is only a couple of blocks away.\u000a\u000arick naturally wanted just some soup.  his taste buds were just waking up, but i decided he should have something mild.  so he ordered the egg drop soup.  i prefer my chinese food a little plainer, so i played it safe and ordered the chicken with snow peas  the chicken and the soup were good, but nothing really spectacular.  new dumpling house is certainly fine if you're in the area or if you don't have a lot of time.  but next time we'll stick with silk pagoda!

Vwe ordered takeout from here last week, for part 7 of our "try every chinese restaurant in squirrel hill" challenge.  and sadly, ndh has landed toward the bottom of the pack.\u000a\u000athe food was ready when they said it would be, and we brought it merrily back to our apartment.  and here is what we got:\u000a\u000aszechuan dumplings in hot sesame sauce:  what?  this dish did not in any way resemble its advertised qualities.  the dumplings were essentially firm balls of pork, wrapped in flimsy dumpling wrappers, and coated in what tasted much more like a peanut sauce than a "hot sesame sauce."  the dish looked sloppy and tasted okay...for hard pork ball dumplings in peanut sauce.  which is not what we wanted, so yeah.  no.\u000a\u000ayaki udon: this dish did arrive as advertised, in that it had scallops, shrimp, vegetables, and noodles.  but i just found it really bland, lacking the delicious savory umami quality that makes me want to slurp up the whole bowl.  seafood was a little tough in texture, and the "vegetables" were essentially grated strips of carrot tossed in.  that was disappointing since part of why i ordered this was because i wanted some vegetables in the dish.  again, no.\u000a\u000ageneral tso's chicken: this is hard to mess up, and they didn't.  crispy, sweet, sticky chicken with a few bits of broccoli in there for good measure.  lots and lots of sauce.  so frankly, nothing exciting to report, just a chinese-american standard.\u000a\u000aall in all, too pricey for what it was, the ingredients seemed low-quality, and there was nothing super delicious at all.  mostly blah.  we probably won't be back.

Vnew dumpling house can best be described as a go to place when you want chinese food to go.  it's the kind of place you order from when you and your significant other are staying in on a saturday night.  my husband rick and i were doing just that, winding down our halloween horror movie fest in our netflix queue.\u000a\u000anew dumpling house is best when you stick to the basics--you know, americanized chinese food.  whereas rick went for the kung pao chicken, my tastes generally run towards more milder food.  i went with my old standby, chicken with snow peas.  and of course we had egg drop soup and egg rolls for appetizers!  \u000a\u000awell like i said, this place isn't very original and i highly advise sticking with the basics.  but the food was the perfect accoutrement for watching the original "frankenstein" and "bride of frankenstein".

Vomigosh!  how could i forget about squirrel hill's other great coffee place, coffee tree roasters!   this place is a bit"cozier" than the shadyside location, but i love that i can walk here and get a really good cup of joe.  as janet g says, sitting outside on a nice summer day is a great way to people watch.\u000a\u000ai also enjoy getting ground coffee to go.  rick and i don't have a coffee grinder at home--they break too easily--so i have them grind it for me here.  i also like that they have the roasting date stamped on the bag.

Vthis is a decent place to get coffee in squirrel hill. it's quite a bit smaller than the location in shadyside; limited seating inside and a few tables outside seem to always have someone smoking at them.\u000a\u000alarge selection of beans for sale, although none of them are certified organic and only one or two are fair trade. wifi is available, although an annoying login procedure is required and i haven't had luck with it working on my iphone.

Vwith so many coffee shops in squirrel hill, it's difficult to choose which one to pick. my boyfriend and i both agree that ctr is our go-to place. we have never had a bad cup of joe, it's always full of flavor but not overpowering.

Vmom and i had a girl's day out at the movies yesterday, and despite the 61c and a few other places being closer to the manor, we decided to come here.  it's always a little dicey trying to get a table here, 'cos the place is a little on the cozy side.  but we did get a table and my cafe americano was just perfect and mom loved her latte.  \u000a\u000aone small complaint though.  i wish they'd update their website.  it't a single page and just gives you their locations.  it doesn' say anything about their coffees or merchandise.

Vevery time i get a loaf of their bread, i come home, cut a slice, and eat it right at the counter. and then i cut another slice, and another. until i realize that i'm standing in the middle of the kitchen just eating bread. \u000a\u000atheir bread is amazing, and look at ingredients - my kalamata olive loaf had 5 total and i knew them all (water, flour, etc) i don't get the bread sliced at the store and haven't had the moldy problem yet. if i know i won't eat it quickly, i put the bread in a fridge. but it does taste best on the day it's baked.\u000a\u000ai haven't tried their pastries but i noticed turner's milk products in a small fridge and some cheeses in a cooler. giant eagle across the street doesn't carry turner's and east end coop is a bit far to go for just milk. this place might save you some driving if you need just the basics.

Vi've been here many times with family and my little cousin even had a birthday party here. it can get busy here but it doesn't get crowded. i took my brother here (newbie bowler) and we had a great time. today is monday so we paid $1 for shoe rental and $2/game for each of us. we looked at the price list on our way out and the prices go up as the week goes on. mondays, tuesdays and thursdays seem to be the most reasonably priced days to go, especially mondays.

Vi've been coming to this eat 'n' park for years, ever since i lived in greenfield.  my husband rick and i come here sometimes since it is only a couple of blocks from where we live.\u000a\u000athey have low-carb options for when my bgs are acting goofy on me.  the thing is, these menu items don't come with any sides, so when you add them in, your carbs go up.  i'll even have a ham-n-cheese omelet with a cup of coffee for dinner.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, their dinners are pretty good.    i like the char-grilled chicken and the chicken alfredo.  for sandwiches, i like their blt, although the burgers are nothing special--they're not bad but i think you can get better burgers elsewhere.  \u000a\u000abreakfasts here are pretty good.  they have the usual assortment of egg, pancake, and waffle dishes.  they do have a fairly good sunday brunch, which is eggs, fresh fruit, muffins, biscuits, stuffing, chicken, pierogies, potatoes, salads, etc.  but when rick and i want to treat ourselves to a special brunch, we usually go to pamela's in shadyside.\u000a \u000ai play in a band with my brother, my cousins, (they're also brother and sister), and two friends.  we like to stop in, usually before a gig.  the food's tasty enough, nothing spectacular, but consistent. \u000ain short, it fills the bill when you need a quick meal.

Vi normally wouldn't write a review for a local chain restaurant like eat n' park.  in fact, i really try not to eat at any chain restaurants, but mom and sis' like the french toast.  so, the reason for the post... i went there today for a late breakfast with my family.  it's a sunday morning, so we expect to wait.  that's no big deal.  we wait for about 20 minutes to get a table and are seated.  the waitress arrives promptly and since we're trying to make it to a movie we place our order right away.  she seems nice at first and the coffee arrives quickly,,, so far so good.... 10 min, 20 min, 30 min... and no refill on the coffee or water, 40 min...waitress comes by to tell us it will be right up, 50 min, 55 min.,  looks like we're missing ironman and i'm gonna be forced to endure the patrick dempsey chick flick... finally mom gets up and finds the waitress who argues with her that it's only been 25 minutes... (huh?).  then says she'll send over the manager.  the manager arrives tells us they are really busy and her other manager is in the back cooking(umm, sorry for your troubles, but having the waitress argue with the customer instead of a simple sorry has nothing to do with you being short staffed).  she offers to pay for our breakfast (which is now lunch due to the wait)... really!  you'll comp. the $3.99 breakfast smile.  how generous!  no thanks, you've just wasted an hour of our lives that we'll never get back.  we leave and i'm  stuck eating goobers and watching the mcdreamy flick.  \u000a\u000athe food is what you'd expect.  nothing worth commenting on and as i just mentioned the only thing i got to try today was the coffee.  the only reason i'm giving it two stars instead of one is for my childhood nostalgia for the smiley cookies.

Vthe absolutely average regional chain diner.\u000a\u000aif you're looking for no frills, few gimmicks, low cost, friendly service, and comfort food, this is the absolute best out there.\u000a\u000ai'm a fan of the breakfast smile, which is two eggs, two pieces of bacon, two pieces of toast, and home fries, hash browns, or grits.\u000a\u000afamily friendly, teenager friendly, senior citizen friendly.  drunk friendly on the graveyard shift, as well.  nonsmoking.

Vmy husband rick and i decided to hang out in the neighborhood today and have some brunch then go to a movie at the manor.  now even though "brunch" might mean some breakfasty foods like eggs, pancakes, etc, there are four reasons why i like eat-n-park:\u000a\u000a1)  coffee\u000a2)  b\u000a3)  l\u000a4)  t\u000a\u000ayep, nothing like a good cup of joe and a blt at 11:30 am on a sunday!

Vthis location is hipster central on the weekends after the bars let out. the late night and early morning crew are all pretty stellar and the restrooms and dining area are always clean. as for the food..well, its e&p - what do expect?

Vas far as the food goes, this place is a-ok. as an eat 'n park, i give this location 4 stars. as i stated previously, the late night staff are pretty awesome and hella patient. if i worked here,  i'd be fired within a week. \u000a\u000athe remodel looks great, i love all of the murray ave.  pics that adorn the walls and kudos to the e&p brand for supporting local growers and incorporating them into their menu.

Vi have not been to this location is such a long time, and i have to say i am impressed.  great job on the remodel.\u000a\u000astill a typical enp however. \u000a\u000awe had superb service from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. the waitress was very attentive to our needs and stopped by frequently to check on us. \u000a\u000athe one bad thing i did notice was that space in here seems to have gone down. it doesn't feel as roomy as it once did. it's still the same space just rearranged to make it look more inviting.

Vi've come here so often, i keep forgetting to update my review of the place.  so granted, it's been a few years since the remodeling job, but i love what they've done with the place.\u000a\u000aanyway it was another one of those nights where my husband and i were just too tired to cook.  eat n park?  you betcha!  it's just simply an old reliable that really fllls the bill when you need it.  and what could be better than a good ol' fashioned blt or turkey club (in my case the latter) washed down with some eat n park coffee?

Vi get my dry cleaning done here primarily because it's convenient and secondarily because of the service. i've brought in clothes and bedding, and they've never messed anything up. it seems expensive (i'm sure i could get men's shirts done cheaper elsewhere), but the location can't be beat.

Vi'll admit, i was skeptical about pamela's pancakes.  how good could they really be?  were they worth waiting in line, in the cold, for?  were they worth sitting at the table by the door and being blasted with cold air every thirty seconds?\u000a\u000ayes.  they were.  they were thin and crispy, with plenty of strawberries and delicious brown sugar-sour cream glaze.  they were so good they didn't even need maple syrup.  the potatoes were pretty good too.  the meal was a little pricier than expected, but the food was filling so now i know that next time, i don't need pancakes and a side of potatoes.\u000a\u000aconsidering how packed this place was at 10:30 on a saturday morning, we got seated amazingly quickly and service was pretty fast.  it does kind of suck that they're cash only, but there are a number of atms on forbes and murray.  i'm looking forward to going back and trying the blueberry and banana & chocolate chip pancakes - hopefully at a table a little farther from the door.

Vi can't believe the less than great reviews for pamela's.  i also can't believe that i've never reviewed this place before, despite it being right around the corner from me.\u000a\u000awell i woke up yesterday with an appetite for a really good breakfast.  so borrowing an idea from a really good friend of mine, i decided to take my guy out to eat.  well he must have really had a great appetite himself because he ordered the bannana walnut pancakes.  carbs!  calories!  fat!  (mmmm, just thinking about that--pump that insulin susan!  pump!).  \u000a\u000awell i am a type-1 diabetic and even though i opted for the slightly less carb-a-lish-ous pancakes and an egg on the side, i still was pumping that insulin 'cos their 'cakes are s-o-o-o-o good!  the menu even bills them as the devil's carb corner!  hey, a girl can't eat just scrambled eggs all her life!  \u000a\u000aa couple of things though.  pamela's does have a lunch menu, but they don't serve these on sunday.  also the place is "cash only" so be sure to stop at the atm beforehand.

Vpump that insulin, susan!\u000a\u000ait's tough to be a type-1 diabetic who loves ice cream and waffle cones!  as i mentioned to one of my yelp friends though, this is one time when i'm glad i'm a girl because it's socially acceptable for females to share a dessert.  it's even socially acceptable for a girl and a guy to share.  these sizes have become insanely huge!\u000a\u000abut anyway, brusters's hasn't been around all that long.  per their website, the chain was started by  bruce reed who opened his first store in bridgewater, pennsylvania in 1989 or so.  this one has been here awhile.  sometimes my husband rick and i will walk from our home in squirrel hill to this place.  it's located in an "eh" kind of strip mall, but it's really a nice place.  \u000a\u000abut as far as the ice cream is concerned, it's really wonderful.  actually, i prefer their ice cream to ben & jerry's and it's every bit as good as baskin robbins.  and now that autumn is here, they are offering fall flavors like pumpkin, pumpkin pecan, dutch apple crunch, and caramel apple .\u000a\u000abut oh, the carbs here!  they have the large waffle cones and their specialty is the sundae in a waffle bowl!  their website does list the carbs for vanilla and chocolate ice cream and they do have "no sugar, no fat" flavors.  the problem here is, as every diabetic knows, the carbs and the "no sugar, no fat" flavors are actually higher in carbs. \u000a\u000a pump that insulin, susan, pump!"

Vbetter than baskin robins or coldstone, not quite as awesome as hagen-dazs or maggie moo's, and is right around the corner from my new place in pittsburgh. danger, danger! \u000a\u000atoday i took the ice cream bull by waffle horns and instead of *talking* about how i'm going to get ice cream, actually *got* ice cream. it was a huge single scoop (really, it was 2.5, i saw him do it!) of turtle-flavored goodness, overflowing from the tasty waffle cone that fell right into my hands for only $3.50! \u000a\u000abut every fairy tale comes to an end, as is this bruster's location - they will be closing at the end of august. so you know what that means, right? better get my share before they do!

Vsummer's coming to an end girls.  what could be better than a nice walk with your guy to get some ice cream?  bruster's is just over a mile from our place, so me and the husband took a nice evening stroll over to get some good ol' fashioned chocolate ice cream?  we shared that chocolate ice cream too.  can't'cha just here them 50s doo-wop tunes playing?\u000a\u000awell, it ain't that i wanted to share.  if i wasn't a type-1 diabetic, i could have packed away that monstorously good ice cream and the waffle cone.  as it was, rick got the cone!

V"susan, why didn't you just go to the library around the corner from us?"   so were my husband's words after i wiped out on my bike while en-route to returning books at the main carnegie library in oakland!\u000a\u000aactually, i do prefer the main library to this one simply because it is much larger and much more fascinating to visit.  but this is a very nice branch, even though it is in a very ugly structure that includes a parking deck.  the staff here is very helpful and the selection is what you'd expect in any neighborhood branch.  if you are in a hurry and want to drop off books, or if you need a good work of fiction to get you through your next two weeks of summer fiction, then this branch of the library certainly will do.

Vi've got to update and upgrade my review here. not only has it been almost three years since i've reviewed it, but the clp has done some serious renovations over the past few years. how could i, a bibliophile (thanks to my librarian mother) who uses the library regularly, have been so remiss? \u000a\u000aso my sister-in-law called me up and asked me if i'd like to take my niece allison to the library today to help with a project on mark twain. would i?! are the beach boys over the hill?  does ticketmaster still rip people off?  did steinbeck and dickens write good books?  asking me to help someone find a book is like asking an etymologist to find words.  allison's at the age now where she's using the adult section.\u000a\u000awe also saw a fine program today, "hurricanes, lightning and tornadoes, oh my!" featuring dennis bowman from kdka-tv.  he gave several weather related demonstrations including how tornadoes are formed and how weather balloons work.  \u000a\u000awho says libraries are obsolete?

Vi forgot how much fun a library can be.  so much i had to visit it twice in the week.  \u000a\u000ait has been years since i stepped foot into a library, what with all the media at our fingertips from our computers to our phones we forget about these oases that are filled with free knowledge.  it was nice to just putz around inside the walls of this library.\u000a\u000ai filled out an application for a library card and thought to myself that i would come back at another time and pick something out.  on my way out however, my mind had other plans.  i saw a book i've been wanting to read for a while and been too stingy to buy it.  lo and behold with my new found power of the library card, i was able to take that book with me that day and i'm already halfway through that book.  \u000a\u000anot to mention if you need to get on the internet in a pinch you can do it here.  even at it's busiest, i think there were still free computers to use.  if you haven't been to a library branch lately, you really ought to get out and discovery one soon.  it's quite the eye opening experience.

Va few variations on classic pizza, the cheese is oddly bland, the sauce is a little sparse, but the crust is indeed perfect. one of the few places that cooks pizza long enough to get some burn on the cheese, which is necessary. comparable to ivp, way better than mineo's.

Vmy husband was out of town on saturday so my brother paul and i decided to get together, maybe look for a couple of christmas gifts, and just kinda hang out together for the day.  after finding one gift for our dad we decided to get some lunch.  honestly, squirrel hill has so many great places that it's tough to decide.  we decided on getting some pizza, but which one?  again, there are so many.\u000a\u000awe decided upon aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  you can eat there or take out.   we took it back to my place.  we're both musicians and we were planning on spending the afternoon jamming anyway.   pizza and music--reminds me of my college days!  paul had ordered from here before.  he suggested the "white pie"  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  we got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  i figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.\u000a\u000athe pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  it was something like $25.00 for ours.  oh and it's "cash-only", but they do have an on-site atm.  for your convenience!

Vi was so disappointed in aiello's.  it was new year's day, and my husband and i did not feel like cooking.  we mistakenly thought aiello's would satiate our hunger.  long story short-- i get the $40 pizza & jalapeno poppers home only to find canned mushrooms on the pizza and no cheese in the poppers.  ugh.

Vi was excited by the rave reviews of this pizza joint, but somewhat disappointed. what's the deal with pittsburgh pizza restaurants and canned toppings? if i order mushrooms, i want them to be fresh!\u000a\u000ato be fair, the crust and sauce were fine, and i think the meat pizzas are probably ok. if i went back, i would probably stick with cheese pizza.

Vi hadn't been to ruggeri's since last year, when i wrote a review.  but my friend marla and i stopped here for lunch after a bike ride.  everything i wrote previously still stands.  my roast beef sandwich was just perfect.  and we split a delicious pasta salad.  we sat outside at one of their little tables.  forget subway--come here instead.

Vyou know, as far as i'm concerned there's nothing like a great sammitch!  of course my ultimate favorite is a great blt.  but i also loves me a good club sandwich, a great italian sub, a fine reuben, a great rachel, and a fantastic corned beef!  \u000a\u000abut ruggeri's, oh man!  how many places are there like this anymore?  need some last minute staples?  they've got 'em!  not sure what you want?  one of their personal shoppers will walk around the shop with you, bag all your groceries for you, and help you load them into your car. \u000a\u000awell let's face it, the a#1 reason why anyone comes to ruggeri's is their sandwiches.  i had to take a leave day and i thought i'd walk on over here for lunch.  their sandwiches are just amazing!  they have daily specials and the hot sausage sandwich sounded mighty tempting.  but i thought i'd go with the deluxe italian.   mmmm, genoa salami, prosciutto, capicola and provolone!  their soups are awesome too!  if you can get here on a monday, their italian wedding soup is just out of this world.  i got a pint of vegetable soup to take home.\u000a\u000athey also have prepared foods, salads, and they offer catering.  \u000a\u000ai've also realized that sometimes it sucks having to work.  'cos if i didn't have to, i'd be here everyday.  of course i'd probably gain about 30lbs too!  and then of course it wouldn't be so much of a treat to eat here.

Vruggeri's is a neighborhood gem. it's a small grocer and deli in the squirrel hill neighborhood in pittsburgh. you can go here for anything from basic groceries, to fresh deli meat, to homemade bread. the highlight, though, is in the form of the freshly made sandwiches and the homemade take-home meals. if you don't feel like cooking, ruggeri's will do it for you, and the food is great! get the meatball hoagie (a friday special) or the italian wedding soup and save the hassle of cooking. even better, since it's a neighborhood grocer, they'll get to know you when you come there, and they even have some customers on account! try to find that at giant eagle.

Vyou always come home to the basics, y'know that?  after being out of town for two weeks, it was sure good to come back to ruggeri's and sink my teeth into one of their fabulous grinders.  that and i bought a pint of their amazing soup to take home.  \u000a\u000awell their grinders are too big for me to consume in one sitting, so i cut mine in half and saved it for lunch today.  m-m-m-m-m!

Vi visited with a friend last night and had a pretty good experience here.  the atmosphere is nice, it wasn't too loud, we were seated with no wait (around 7pm) and as another reviewer mentioned, their flatware is pretty darn cool.  the only thing that bugged me is that the lights kept flickering, but that's a pretty minor gripe.  the service was attentive without being intrusive.\u000a\u000asome of the appetizers seem pretty pricey, but it's only $3.50 for two spring rolls which were pretty good.  we split a pumpkin curry and the bean thread noodles, both with tofu.  i usually like my tofu crispier and pan-seared on the outside and theirs looked like it had barely touched the pan.  i also thought the sauce on the bean thread noodles was pretty bland and sparse.  but the pumpkin was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the noodles were generally pretty good.  i've also tried a panang curry, which was delicious but the spice level of 6 was a bit much for me, and the pad thai, which was ok but a little bland.  it seems like the curries have much more flavors than the noodles, so maybe keep that in mind when ordering.\u000a\u000athe total for the spring rolls and 2 entrees was $31 before tip.  even though i wasn't blown away by the food, i am looking forward to coming back to try more.

Vi remember when bangkok balcony still opened. i was a college student at cmu, right down forbes avenue. lemongrass used to be in that location, and it was pretty good. so, i was wondering what the new place would bring. well, at that point i was pleasantly surprised by the renovated restaurant still making good use of the 2nd floor windows overlooking forbes avenue. the food was tasty and, coupled with the fact that it was close by, i remember coming here all the time. someone's birthday? bangkok balcony! stress relief from finals? bangkok balcony! hungry and procrastinating? bangkok balcony! \u000a\u000ai went back for the first time in many years this past week and was let down. the food just wasn't what i remembered it to be. it's still okay, and for someone who doesn't walk in with high expectations, it probably will do. i had a very safe dish - the penang curry, which was decent but there are better ones in pittsburgh (thai cuisine in liberty, for one). the rice wasn't really that good either - and really, how do you f*&k up rice? two of my dining friends had the pad see ew, which they really didn't like. one of them said "it tastes sour, like vinegar." while i'm no expert about what ingredients should go into pad see ew, the look on her disappointed face told me the vinegar taste was not appreciated. \u000a\u000aoverall i would give it 3 stars because i think a lot of the experience was tainted by high expectations. even tho i still like the location and feel of the restaurant, i don't think i'll be going back because i just don't want to waste a good meal. i can enjoy myself much more with the pad thai from spice island, or the curry from thai cuisine. \u000a\u000aoh - and yes i admit that i have f*%&ed up rice before, but i don't cook and make other people pay to eat it. restaurants don't have the same leeway!

Vhad a nice dinner here on a sunday evening and was surprised that the restaurant provided live entertainment in the form of thai dancers. all the food we ordered was delicious, especially the pumpkin curry which had nice large chunks of pumpkin in it. as this restaurant is located on the second story, the best seats are near the window looking out over forbes avenue. the people sitting at the table next to us ordered a whole fish which was somewhat alarming to look at but apparently tasty to eat! no complaints really, highly recommended.

Vvery cool decor and a nice spot to peoplewatch if you sit by the window. but the part of forbes between murray and shady must be cursed with untasty food spell (ice cream and donuts not included). i tried the egg rolls (tiny!), tofu fried rice (eeeh, i make better tofu at home and i suck), and fried banana and coconut ice cream (yum! for ice cream, banana - eh)\u000a\u000awith this, i give up reviewing pittsburgh restaurants because i don't want to sound like debbie downer in all my reviews.

Vincredible!\u000a\u000ai had the pumpkin soup - a favorite of mine - this was the second best i've had. (#1 belongs to abay). i also had the tofu platter, veggies were spot on, cooked until soft but still retaining shape, color, and texture.\u000a\u000amy companion had the vegetable coconut soup which was overflowing with all sorts of veggies and the broth was just heavenly. he also ordered mussaman chicken curry which consisted of big chunks of chicken and potatoes that were simmered in the sweet yet spicy mussaman sauce.  i actually ended up dipping my veggies in his sauce, it was so wonderful.\u000a\u000awe both got a spice level 9 which provided just enough heat without making your nose run. the staff were friendly and efficient. can't wait to go back.

Vbangkok balcony = nom.  i've never eaten in here, but i've gotten take out twice and it was awesome both times.\u000a\u000awe ordered a ton of food to feed five of us last week, and still enjoyed a few days of leftovers.  we got.....\u000a-thai spring rolls (some with chicken, some with shrimp, some veg) - all crunchy and delish.\u000a-coconut soup (my boyfriend likes it, i didn't try it)\u000a-pad thai \u000a-see you noodles\u000a-mussaman curry\u000a-panang curry\u000a\u000aand everything was really good.  the curries were a huge hit - i loved the mussaman, but everyone else was raving about the panang.  the see-you noodles (pad see ew, essenially) were delish, that's one of my favorite standards.\u000a\u000ait's pricey, for thai....well, it's pricey for take out thai.  back in chicago, my boyfriend and i were happily living in the land of $7 curries, and the idea of paying $14 for curry was ridiculous.  i'm bummed that there is no cheaper thai place near us, so we don't go to bangkok balcony as much as i'd like to.  but when parents are in town, or if you want to sit down and really have a dining experience, i think it's worth it.  and it's really high quality and delicious so that makes the price more justifiable.  sort of.

Vyay! another fabulous mom & pop diner. when you walk into kristophers, you're usually greeted by some of the locals who are enjoying their morning coffee while reading the newspaper. sit anywhere you'd like and the waitress/cook will soon be pouring you a cup of java. grab a menu and decide if you're in a sweet or savory mood. we are always in an savory mood so i usually opt for a spinach & feta omelette and homefries with veggies. my boyfriend gets a sandwich with gyro meat and a fried egg with gravy on his homefries which he enjoys immensely. everything is made to order (please be patient - it's worth the wait!) and the cooks are generous with ingrediants and portions. you won't leave hungry or broke.

Vthe boyfriend and i went to try kristopher's lunch menu since we've been going there, we have only had breakfast...now we know why. \u000a\u000awe weren't really starving so i just got a grilled cheese and salad - both were very, very basic ad justin had a burger and onion rings. the rings went from the freezer to the frier and his burger was "just a burger". \u000a\u000awe were disappointed but our opinion of the place hasn't changed - kristopher's in known for their breakfast (which is served all day) and everything we've had up until now has been exceptionally tasty so we're gonna to keep on going but stick to the breakfast menu.

Vmy husband rick had heard great things about kristopher's place for the longest so he suggested we come here for breakfast.  believe me folks, i was in the mood for a great breakfast.  thing is i'd just gotten over a stomach virus.  and you've gotta remember, as soon as susan recuperates from a digestive ailment, she wants to chow!\u000a\u000aso i went for breakfast special #2:  two eggs (i had mine fried), home fries, two pieces of sausage, and two pancakes.   mmmmm!  pancakes!  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!  i washed all that down with a couple of cups of terrific coffee.  and yes i was a member of the clean plate club.\u000a\u000akristophers has all the ambiance of an old-time corner diner, but in a good way.  it's a place where the neighborhood oldtimers come to discuss sports or the news over a cup of coffee.  i lived in greenfield for a few years and i'm surprised i never ate here, despite it being next door to vocelli pizza and across from giant eagle.  if you want a good ol'fashioned meal, come here.

Vif i go to get a haircut, i want a haircut. i don't care what you're putting in my hair or how it smells so stop trying to sell it to me. if i said i don't want to buy the shampoo, chances are i'm not going to buy the shine enhancer either and thank you for pointing out the "regrowth" of my eyebrows but no, i don't want a wax...i'll go home and pluck it for free.

Vi was so in the mood for a really good cheeseburger today, so i had to go ahead and have one.  this was my day off, but unfortunately not for my friends, relatives or my husband.  well, maybe fortunately 'cos sometimes i do like to go out for lunch by myself.\u000a\u000aanyway, that cheeseburger craving need satisfying and fast!  and nothing from mcd's or bk would do either!  i wanted a real burger!  and let me tell you, they have great burgers here!  and the choices of cheese here!  american, swiss, provolone, colby, jack, gouda, or mozzerella!  i went for the gouda on mine.  they even have sauces, which i didn't try, including an apricot salsa for your burger.\u000a\u000athe only drawback is the size of their burgers  these bad boys are nine ounces, more than half a pound!  if i'm with a friend, i'll share my burger, but not today!  that's okay.  i saved my fries for my husband rick.  i think my tummy is going to be digesting that burger until christmas!

V(imitating homer simpson)  mmmmmm, murray avenue grill, ahhhh!  i had the day off yesterday, so i went here with my friend marla.  i had the lunch-sized steak, which was grilled to perfection.  marla tried the seared ahi tuna salad, which looked interesting too.  but i was in a red meat mood!

Vokay, update #2!\u000a\u000awith the return of some nice weather, my cousin cindy and i decided to do some shopping in the neighborhood.  we hit ten thousand villages and a couple of other places.  we hit the murray avenue grill for sunday brunch.  lemme say this:  m.a.g.'s brunch goes beyond your typical eggs, pancakes, and waffles.  now i played it a little safer, ordering the ahi tuna salad, with grilled tomatoes and mixed veggies.  i did try the pepper parmesan dressing.  here's a hint if you want dressing on your salad and you want to save calories.  don't put your dressing on the salad, but rather dip the prongs of your fork in it.  you'll still get the same flavor!\u000a\u000acindy tried something adventurous--the breakfast rueben..  this concoction is corned beef, swiss, kraut, & 1000 island dressing between two potato pancakes.  oh yes, with 2 eggs on the side!

Vwe were really disappointed with our food here.  i went in november, so i don't remember details about service and atmosphere, but the one thing i remember vividly was how not good the burgers were.  first, they switched mine and my mom's - i like mine rarer than mom, so since the waitress mixed them up, i was chewing on her more well-done (and subsequently dry) burger until we figured out there'd been a switch.  but even her burger, supposedly medium rare, couldn't save the overall taste. the patties seemed to be nothing more than ground beef - flavorless, no hint of spices or anything.  and dry, not nearly juicy enough.  \u000a\u000ait's a shame, because we live so nearby and could easily go here often if it was any good.  the specials on the chalkboard outside always sound enticing, but i just shake my head and think it isn't worth trying.  it's probably worse than it sounds.

Vdecent food, not a lot of vegetarian options. i had a cheese ravioli special, which consisted of 5 huge cheese stuffed pasta pockets baked in marinara and topped with bubbly mozz. everything tasted good but i wasn't impressed, i could have done that at home. the regular menu is a bit uninspired and kinda run-of-the-mill. will we be returning? maybe, when we run out of options.

Vmurray ave grill is essentially the only american restaurant in sq hill, so they've got you cornered if you just want a steak or salad.  the space isn't bad, but they play '50's music, which just doesn't go with anything in there.  the service is usually nice and attentive. they've got a decent beer selection, and the drinks flow until 2am.  when the weather's nice, there's outdoor seating; and they also have sunday brunch.

Vpeople who rave about this place either remember it fondly from years gone by or don't know any better. i used to eat here when i was young, but its quality has slipped.  the sauce is ok, as another reviewer said, but he was right:  the crust could be better. the quality of the cheese is okay also. the pizza tends to be a little  overbaked here.  still, it is not a bad choice.

Vcheese was pure solid, too salty, and half an inch thick. way too greasy, partially from being too cold, partially from just being greasy. crust was pretty good. a major plus is that it actually looks and feels like a pizza place inside.

Vwhen i think about ordering a pizza, it's hard to imagine ordering someplace else. i loooove cheese and mineo's is quite generous (the cheese is often thicker than the crust). you can always ask them to go easy on the cheese and they'll tone it down. i highly recommmend getting a white pie with ricotta, tomato, and mozzarella. dee-lish!!

Vi've got to update my review a little.  to be honest, my husband rick likes mineo's a little better than i do.  there are a lot of other pizza shops in squirrel hill and my personal preference is aiello's.  plus i want to try lucci's.\u000a\u000athat said, the pizza here is still good.  it's just that they bury everything under mounds of cheese here.  if you don't like your pizza so cheesy, then this place is not for you.  we decided to hang out in the neighborhood saturday night.  y'know, pizza and then a movie at the manor.  we ordered ours with pepperoni, onions, and black olives.  not too bad, but i get very full after just a couple of slices.  \u000a\u000athey've got sandwiches here.  maybe one of these days i'll stop in and get me one.

Vordered takeout from here the day before we moved out of town - so we had no chairs in our apartment, and needed something we could eat quickly, standing up against a counter.  pizza made the most sense!  since mineo's is a classic pittsburgh pizza joint, we thought we should finally check it out.\u000a\u000ai trudged over in the snow to pick up our pizzas, which were about $20 each for a large with 1-2 toppings.  the counter staff was extremely friendly and gave me all the extra plates and silverware i needed because ours was all packed.  i carried them back to our apartment where we opened them up, and saw that the cheese had sort of....swirled around messily in the center of the pizzas.  as if the cheese wasn't firmly attached to the crust, but sort of a loose, amorphous being with a mind of its own.  i immediately started apologizing, fearing that i had tilted the pizzas while i was carrying them, but then one of our friends said "no, that's how it always is from mineo's."  um, okay.  kind of weird, but at least it wasn't my fault!\u000a\u000athe pizza was tasty, but very messy.  it didn't really stay uniform and attached, with globs of cheese sliding off the crust into the middle of the box.  people would pull out a slice and suddenly realize they only had crust and sauce because everything else was gone.  it's like there's too much cheese for such a thin crust, it can't support the weight!\u000a\u000aso it was definitely knife and fork pizza, but it was decent-tasting.  pretty standard.  but i have to say - grossly overpriced for what you get.  and thus the two stars.  if this pizza was like...$7 less per pie, i'd give it 3 stars.  but seriously - it's just ridiculous.  it really was totally average, but they charge you like it's made of gold.   i truly do not understand what makes this such a lauded pizza place.

Vi am not sure why people are always raving about this restaurant.  sure, it's okay, but honestly, nothing special.  there food is never bad, but never so great that it wows me.  i do like its location (convenient, right off the bus line).  whatever you do, and i have other people that agree with me, don't bother with a dessert.  i believe that a dessert was once described as "lavender soap" to me (i can't remember the exact dessert, but that description didn't exactly encourage me to find out more information).  subsequent desserts were not wonderful and suspect going elsewhere for the dessert is just a better idea.  service is friendly here though and that is part of its charm.\u000a\u000aoverall, a decent italian restaurant that can get pricey if you don't watch out.  i may come back, but only if i can't get to other italian restaurants.

Vi had tried several different optometrists before coming to this shop.  i like this guy the bst of them all.  and the staff is super nice and helpful.  selection-wise, they have some interesting frames even if it isn't as extensive a selection as i would like.

Vi came here for my first eye doctor appointment since moving to pittsburgh.  a coworker and a coworker's husband both see dr. hirsch here, so i came for my annual eye checkup.  they took my insurance (vision benefits of america) so i had no copay.\u000a\u000adr. hirsch is very thorough.  i told him my father had experienced a retinal detachment, and he told me what to watch out for in case that happens to me.  he ran a wide variety of tests, checking everything, dilated my pupils, gave me the "puff" test, looked at my glasses and contacts, confirmed my prescription.  \u000a\u000ahis mannerisms are a bit unusual; he lacks the poised polish and smooth talk that so many doctors have.  so don't go in expecting to have small talk or make jokes.  but all your optical needs will be well-met, and that's really what matters.

Vconveniently located in squirrel hill and with good hours for those of us with unpredictable hours (they open at 6 am!).  they always do a good job and the one time they missed a stain, they took care of it promptly and i had the garment back in a couple days sans (without, for those who don't know french) the stain.  the prices are a little higher than i would like to pay, but then again, i am used to $2 drycleaning in other cities.  i am also a believer that you pay for what you get - and they always do a good job.

Vi'm starting to feel as though i'm the kiss of death to dry cleaners; as soon as i find one i like, it closes. i hope that isn't the case because my experience at nulife will keep me coming back.\u000a\u000ai needed to have my comforter cleaned and i initially to it to colonial cleaners, but they wouldn't do it and told my to wash it at home. if it was possible, i would have been doing that in the first place. that ended up working to my advantage because i found myself at nulife. the woman behind the counter was super sweet and couldn't believe i was turned away beforehand. i dropped it off on a thursday and told her i was in no rush for it to be done so she told me to pick it up on the following tuesday.\u000a\u000ai didn't ask for a quote but i'm sure she would have given me one. just the comforter  ended up costing $50 which i thought was kind of high though i don't remember how much it cost before because we had several different items we took with it. it was worth it, whatever the cost. they did a great job with it, the staff were friendly and its supporting a small, local business.

Vwhat's not to like about the squirrel cage?  it's not a theme bar, you'll not find any cheesy decor or anything fancy that matter.  it's simply a great neighborhood place.  as other posters say, it's a place to have good, cheap, greasy food and a beer (okay, so i'm primarily a non-drinker).  it's a great place to people watch too because here you see people as they really are.  they come here and they act like themselves and aren't putting on an act like at some lame club.

Va pretty big beer selection for guys plus a lot of fruity liquors for girls, a no-frills food menu that includes pretty decent fries, and zero pretentiousness means that this is a fair to good place to catch up with friends.  the smoke gets annoying after a while, which is really my only gripe.  but other than that - a-ok.

Vlove bill the bartender - he was awarded "best bartender in pittsburgh" by the city paper readers a couple years ago and lives up to the reputation. meet him twice and he knows your name and what you like. the "squirrel cage" has a fabulous beer selection full of micro brews and imports and a great jukebox with infinite possibilities. \u000a\u000athe only problem i have is that when school is in session it gets super crowded all the time so go early and grab a bite to eat. large portions, good food, and great prices, you can't ask for much more.

Vi think i figured out why this place is called the cage.  there's no concrete evidence that what i observed here is true.  you walk in and you see a mix of people that would represent different classifications of people you'd see throughout pittsburgh.  each booth and table is a different subset of the population.  every booth and table is an exhibit or cage at a zoo, there for you to observe how each group interacts with one another.\u000a\u000aerr, what am i saying?  maybe i just enjoyed myself so much here that i started spacing out. i mean you do get to see a wide mix of the human race interacting in here, but who cares, they are all there for one thing, to have a good time.  \u000a\u000awhether you are sitting at the bar or pick a booth along the wall, the staff are there to make sure you have a libation nearby.  always able to make a suggestion if you want to try something new. \u000a\u000athe music touch has a nice mix of music to fulfill anyone's need to hear tunes. but who needs tunes when you can just sit there and chat the whole night?\u000a\u000ai'm still skeptical about going up to the loft area. it looks so small from down below.\u000a\u000asuch a nice intimate place to go and grab a beer with friends.  it's a great place to sit and blow off some steam.  beer selection is pretty good.  they have their fair share of seasonal blends, as well as

Vi brought my favorite pair of black ankle boots in for repair - they needed new heels, new soles, and some of the leather on the decorative buttons was coming off....basically i had worn them into the ground and they needed major tlc.  i also brought in my uggs, covered in salt stains that had been sitting on them for months.\u000a\u000afast forward one week later - shoes are stainless (it took 3 shampoos, the guy told me!), but still have sort of a hard texture on the outside (my fault, for not pretreating them).  my leather boots have new heels and soles.  the leather buttons were the only part not fixed to my total satisfaction - they removed the leather and attempted to paint the (now silver) buttons with black shoe polish so they'd match the rest of the shoe in color, but the paint/polish started chipping off immediately and you can see the silver peeking through on all the buttons.  but perhaps that can't be helped - i'll try to paint those on my own and see what happens.\u000a\u000a$30 for both shoe repairs.  the work was high quality, done in a week, and service was perfectly fine and friendly.  cash only.  i'm so glad this place is nearby, because i like to buy nice shoes (actually, i have to - my feet are so teeny, the only place i can find shoes that fit is nordstrom's), and it is totally worth it to pay a few bucks to get them fixed once every year or two!  now they will last at least another season!

Vdr. bonsteel is fantastic!  my husband, who hates the dentist, had to get extensive work done to fix what the military did to his teeth. dr. bonsteel made all of it happen with minimal agony for my husband and our pocketbook.  \u000athey're conveniently located on forbes and shady, above the dunkin' donuts, and they take upmc dental insurance.

Vi've only ever gone here for eyebrow waxes, but this place is delightful. the staff is super sweet, made up of real people and not salon-robots. the space is clean, bright, and well-lit. the services are priced fairly, and the results are top-notch. i never spoke to anyone who had a bad experience here, and i asked around a lot because i'm so crazy protective of my eyebrows. \u000a\u000ait is up two flights of stairs and a landing, and i don't know if they have any wheelchair accessibility. it's tough for heavy smokers to make it up all those stairs.

Vmatzo ball soup is excellent and can make you feel better no matter the ailment.  the chicken liver goes great on the hot pastrami.  i was there recently and a guest tried the lox and eggs.  it was okay, but overly salty.  this is a better than average deli, but really doesn't compare to barney greengrass or katz in nyc.

Vmmmmm!  a traditional pittsburgh deli and neighborhood place.  you can't beat it!  my husband was busy yesterday, and having nothing else to do, i came here for a good lunch.\u000a\u000aforget the chain deli's!  come here for a really good sandwich.  begin your lunch with a bowl of chili and vermont cheddar, or "cincinnati style" with lots of noodles.  or even better, their homemade chicken soup with noodles.\u000a\u000akazansky's does have dinner items available, but for me, the real reason to come here is for the sandwiches.  the corned beef is really tender, and no i don't order it "extra lean" (the fat has all of the flavor)!  the turkey is real turkey breast and not that "pressed" or "formed" turkey that some places serve.  my absolute favorite is the pastrami sandwich.  i love it with extra mustard.  they also have terrific salads here too, and the specialty is the walnut trout salad.\u000a\u000asome places have wine lists.  this place has a beer list, with at least 10 beers on tap every day.  they have beer drinkers covered with an "a to z" list of bottled beers and a new bar.  unfortunately because of my diabetes, i'm pretty much a non-drinker.\u000a\u000aof course, they have "jewish specialties" on the menu here, including challah french toast with fresh strawberries (my husband rick loves it), latkes, kugel, and borscht.  i like what kazansky's says about borscht, "if you don't know what it is, don't order it."

Vso with monday afternoon being my friend catherine's last in pittsburgh for awhile--she was catching an evening flight back to chicago--we decided to stroll around squirrel hill, do a little shopping, and have lunch.  i wanted to introduce her to one last local place before she had to head back.\u000a\u000anaturally, we stopped at kazansky's.  this time i had a reuben instead of my traditional pastrami sandwich.   it was still the best.  catherine tried the big skyler, which is turkey and pesto.  and since she likes beer, i had her try a yuengling.  she loved it!

Vfood seems to be hit and miss. the kugel was very good if a little pricey for the portion. the brisket was incredibly dry, but the roll, sauce and pickle were all good.\u000a\u000a4 stars for anyone who brings me chicken kneidel soup when i feel like this. i might be able to do homework now.

Vthis has got to be the cheapest breakfast you can get in pgh! i think everything on the breakfast menu was under $5 and the portions were regular-sized. the food itself was alright, service was great - our waiter kept cracking jokes and was overall very pleasant. \u000a\u000ain the front is the actual deli where you can get stuff to go and they sell 6-packs (looks like a good selection too)

Vi wouldn't go back for anything except a six pack of beer, unless the name changes again.\u000a\u000athe fried fish sandwich is a frozen, prebreaded thing they dropped in the fryer.  my friend commented the same quality at 1/3rd the cost is why folks go to mcdonald's.\u000a\u000ai ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich.  they were out of turkey breast, so i okayed a lunch-meat turkey sandwich.  which was small, expensive, and completely underwhelming.\u000a\u000ait's like they tried to take an old jewish deli and turn it into a sports bar, and gave up somewhere around halfway.  i don't want a beer with my sandwich, but i do want the sandwich to be passable or better.  \u000a\u000aour waitress was okay, which made me consider bumping this to two stars; she looked as if she was in college, so the odds are that the one high spot will leave, and the rest will stay the same.\u000a\u000athe bagel factory on the other end of the neighborhood far exceeds this for quality, at the same price.

Vyou could say this review is for citizens bank in general, i chose this branch because its closest to me and the one i visit most. \u000a\u000ayesterday i went to buy dinner on my break and my card got declined, no problem - i'll just run around the corner and get cash since i knew there was money in the account.  went to the atm and all i got was a slip saying my card has been deactivated.  okay, now i'm starting to freak out a bit so i got to my computer and checked my account online, my money was still in both accounts, safe and sound and the exact amount that should have been. next step was to make a call to customer service. turns out the fraud department flagged the account because  someone tried to make a $110 purchase at a walgreen's in colorado at 6am??? they caught it immediately and my new card is in the mail. i'm so glad the red flag went up so fast and my funds are in tact, my only wish is that they had notified me before hand (a call or email), it would have saved me a little embarrassment. luckily i was only at a cafe' and not a nice sit down establishment, else i would have been mortified.\u000a\u000alesson learned! start carrying cash and don't use the debit card so much.\u000a\u000aas for the sq. hill branch itself, the employees have always been friendly and helpful and you can usually get in & out pretty quickly.

Vodd location, anytime i'm in a circular building i feel weird.\u000a\u000aonly really went here to deposit some funds in the atm and had to run inside in order to use a pen.  i really don't understand why banks feel like you've walked into a monastery.  it's so quiet in there, everyone talks in a whisper and you feel as if you're invading on someone else's privacy when you may have actually overheard anything they've said.  \u000a\u000ai made a quick run at this so i didn't have to endure any more awkwardness of the whole situation.  i'll stick to my drive thru/stand alone atms from now on.

Vseriously folks, ya gotta love the 61c!  how many other food establishments can you name that were named after the bus route they're on?  i've been coming here since i was a teenager back in the 1990s.\u000a\u000aas caitlin says above, there's no cheesy decor at this place--it actually seems pretty subdued.  you can hang around here for a few hours--wish i could still do that like back when i was in college.  i love coming here on a rainy day with a good book and drinking a nice cappucino or just plain coffee while keeping good company with mssrs. steinbeck or dickens or twain.

Vah the perfect "girls night out!"  a movie, then some coffee or tea at the 61c, then home and in bed by 11pm!  sherry and i had some wonderful decaf teas.  my friend marla is one of those who can drink a cappucino at 10pm and then go right to bed.  i hate her!  \u000a\u000ano, marla honey, i love ya!

Vi've never been disappointed by anything i've ordered (coffee, tea, pastries, lemonade, smoothies) they have a lot to offer and you can get whatever flavor combination tickles your fancy. one day i was feeling adventurous and ordered a strawberry-coconut soy latte. the barista said "in 15 years i've never made that before" it was amazing! \u000a\u000athe only negative things i have to say about the 61c is that it can get very crowded and the tables are situated very close together to maximize seating .

Vokay.....i've only been here twice, so it's hard to judge.  but there were two things i disliked.\u000a\u000a1. hardly any outlets!\u000a2. my chai latte, which was neither hot nor very tasty.  wah waaaaaah.\u000a\u000ait's like, a block from my house, so i'm sure i'll give them another go.  there was a super friendly barista dude there last time, and the outdoor patio looks nice in summer.  but i'll need to have a tasty beverage of some sort in order to up this review.  sad face because i love local businesses!  but....i also love tasty chai lattes.  and i did not get one.

Vthe 61c has long been a coffee mainstay in squirrel hill. and it's the perfect place to go before or after a movie at the nearby manor. my friend marla & i did just that last night. we came here for a little libation after seeing "of gods and men" (which was very good, btw). despite my love, nay dependence for caffeine-y goodness in the morning, it does keep me up at night.  my decaf tea with biscotti really hit the spot though.\u000a\u000aand yes marla is still one of those people who can drink an espresso at 10pm and then go to bed.

Vi am going to have to concur with the previous reviewer on this one.  although i think they were perfectly friendly towards me, i certainly also had to be proactive about getting my jewelry back, and i was also surprised at the cost.  \u000a\u000ai had two clip on earrings converted to posts, which i would consider to be a relatively easy thing to do.  they told me they would call me to tell me when to come and pick it up, and gave themselves a window of two weeks.  i finally called after three weeks, and they told me it would be done in a few days.  it was almost as though if i hadn't called, they would have forgotten to do it, but because i called, they remembered.  i thought that was odd.\u000a\u000athat being said, the quality of the work is superb.  the guy seemed genuinely interested in whether i was happy with his handiwork, so that was nice, but i agree - the pricing seems unreasonably high, and the service does not convey a concern for the customer.  the hours are also nonsensical.  i might come back again, but i might not.

Vi had a day off from work today and since i've been looking for a good sandwich place since kazansky's closed, i thought i'd try uncle sam's.  believe me folks, the subs here are ridiculously large.  i know that uncle sam's is known for their fries but that's why i skipped them.\u000a\u000ai went for the salami and cheese sub which was pretty tasty.  but i guess subs don't do it for me like a good sammitch does!

Vi'd been sick for a few days and not up for cooking, so my boyfriend and i went in search of a cheap lunch.  uncle sam's, down the block, had been calling our name for weeks.  in need of big-time sustenance to help me fight the germs, i was ready for a meaty sandwich.\u000a\u000ainside, there was plenty of seating, and a few tvs showing the penguins game.  the staff behind the counter was young and enthusiastic, chatting with each other and commenting on the hockey action.  we placed our orders at the far end of the counter - i got the loaded italian sausage sub (comes with flavorful italian sausage, grilled onions/peppers, and cheese).  i was confused when the girl taking my order asked if i wanted lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  um....no.  that seems totally wrong on an italian sausage and peppers sandwich.  my boyfriend got a philly cheesesteak, and despite my badgering, he did get it with tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo.  his philosophy is pretty much to get every available topping on a sandwich if it will make it more delicious.\u000a\u000awe waited for about 10 minutes while a guy working a big grill surface browned up our meat.  it was fun to watch taylor's cheesesteak turn from a gorgeous deep red to a delicious steaky brown.  i appreciate that they cook everything to order here, and they don't have piles of cooked meat waiting around to be thawed or microwaved or anything.  our sandwiches were about $7 each i think, which was reasonable since the ingredients seemed pretty fresh, and the sandwiches were huge.\u000a\u000awe took them home, and they were still warm when we unwrapped them.  they were both pretty good - i didn't exactly hear angels singing, but the meat was flavorful in each (and both sandwiches were definitely heavy on the meat!)  a regular size person with a normal appetite could easily get two meals out of one big sandwich.  i preferred my italian sausage to the cheesesteak, since mine had more seasonings, the addition of grilled veggies, and no (totally boring and unnecessary lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  no!)  \u000a\u000ai was thinking 3 1/2 stars, trying to determine whether to give them an edge up or down, when my boyfriend told me that the people behind the counter making the sandwiches weren't wearing gloves?  .....blargh.  i was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but he assured me that he saw the grill-guy pick up our meat with bare hands and put it on the grill.  to be fair, there were some little pieces of wax paper partially enclosing the meat, but still.  and the girl who wrapped our sandwiches did not have gloves on either, he noticed.  maybe they work really hard to avoid directly touching the food....but still, i'd say gloves are preferable.\u000a\u000ai'm pretty much the opposite of a germophobe, so i don't really care that much, but i think 3 stars is fair for now.  i'm sure we'll be back to try another sandwich, and if it impresses me, i think 4 stars is in their future.  waaaaaaay better than a jimmy john's/subway type place, no contest there.

Virene did some mending and alterations for me recently.  mending was done very well - i found, however, that the pants she hemmed too short.  i don't know how it happened - i am sure i wore the "right" shoes for the accurate hem - but they were still too short and i looked ridiculous at work, so i returned to have them taken down a bit more.  she redid the hem within a few days and didn't charge me for the fix.  i was satisfied with the work, the price, and the amount of time it took to do it.

Vi go to irene for all my tailoring needs.  i get some of the negative reviews about her - she's not exactly the most service oriented person i've met, and can come across as being pretty opinionated and not particularly nice.  that being said, i appreciate it when she tells me that something is worth repairing or not, and she's done a great job on pretty much everything she's been willing to do.  this last week, she took in the sides of two silk shirts that i brought in, and basically re-engineered the shirts, sleeves and all.  they look fabulous, and i know that requires a lot of skill.\u000a\u000ashe doesn't explain how she prices things, which sometimes turns me off, cuz she's not exactly cheap.  but, she definitely knows her stuff.

Vthe low overall rating, in my opinion, is a totally inaccurate summary of the jcc.  they provide a ton of different services - having to swipe your card twice at the door or finding a broken treadmill should not be the basis for a bad review of a large organization that provides childcare, gym space, cultural activities, classes, lecturers, festivals....it's so much more than what people are describing here.\u000a\u000ai go to the gym at the jcc because i live extremely nearby.  it is incredibly convenient for me.  i think the price is reasonable, and you can get a couple's membership that is cheaper than two single memberships.  as a "young adult couple," we pay $71 a month, only slightly more than a single membership, so that's a great deal!  especially coming from chicago, $35 a month is nothing.\u000a\u000awe don't have the more expensive upgraded membership, so we use the standard locker room (if you have the fancy membership, you use the adults-only locker room with a hot tub and tv and couches and stuff) but it's totally fine.  sure there are kids scampering around, but please remember this is a community center, not just a gym, so there are kids changing for swim lessons and things like that.\u000a\u000ai think the gym facilities are great and i have no idea what anybody would complain about.  even at peak hours (after 5pm on weekdays), i can almost always get right on a treadmill.  the only exception to this was the first months of the year, when new years resolution folks swarmed the gym.  but that will happen anywhere, so it isn't the jcc's fault.  generally there is no line of people waiting for cardio equipment.  any gym where i can immediately get on a treadmill at 530 pm is a miracle in my book - in chicago, not a chance.  the treadmills (and ellipticals, i think?) have individual tvs, you can bring in headphones and watch tv while you run!  some of the audio outlets can get wonky at times, but you can almost always find a treadmill with one that works perfectly.\u000a\u000ai think the weight room is well-equipped.  it isn't the biggest ever, but honestly it isn't ever crowded, so clearly they have all the equipment to meet the demand.  i do a wide variety of upper and lower body exercises - there are several machines for all muscle groups, and lots of free weights.  occasionally a machine is broken, but not nearly as often as other commenters have said.  \u000a\u000awe like the staff at the jcc - one of the guys in the cardio room always remembers us and our names, and tells us when a new machine has come in so we can try it.  i've never worked with a personal trainer - i have no idea how good they are.  i know they all have various types of accreditation and degrees in sports medicine and exercise science - you can look online and see their qualifications.  i probably won't be trying their training, just because i'm confident in my workout routine as it is.  i did take a group exercise class once ($5 each, unless you have a fancy membership) and it kicked my butt, in a good way, so my impression of the classes is positive.\u000a\u000alike with any gym, when you join there are rules about payment, early cancellation, that kind of thing.  just ask in advance, and get it in writing.  don't try to cancel halfway through the year and expect them to stop billing you immediately - be smart, take the initiative and plan in advance if you know you need to cut out of your contract early.  they told me upon signing that they prefer year contracts, but they are willing to work with people who need to cut out early for reasons that can't be helped (like moving), but you need to be proactive about it.  just a pet peeve of mine when people complain about this - the gym i used to go to in chicago had some weird rule where you had to write a letter to the corporate headquarters to cancel.  everyone on yelp was writing reviews like "i can't cancel, they keep charging me, this gym suuuuucks!"  but if you just read your contract, or you know, ask a little in advance, you can learn how to do it without getting overcharged.\u000a\u000ai haven't engaged in many of their community activities since i'm pretty much an atheist and not super connected to jewish culture, but we did stop by their israel independence day festival (they had a petting zoo!) and they've had lots of other cool things going on for community members.  the jcc supports health, community involvement, child development....it's way more than just a place for you to work out.

Vi can't believe i've never reviewed this place before.  my husband and i live in squirrel hill and we've only been here once.   it's niether good enough to rave about nor bad enough to totally slam.  the desserts, here are their specialty and one reason the place is so popular is that you can get a late night sweet.  occasionally they'll book a really good jazz act here.

Vif it weren't for two friends who absolutely love gullifty's and swear by their desert, i would have only tried gullifty's once.\u000a\u000ait's not because gullifty's is bad - the desert is fine - but i don't think it warrants the title of "best desert in pittsburgh." gullifty's is like an independent eat n park. portions are plentiful, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the food is average. if that's what your'e looking for, this is the place to go.

Vupgrading to four stars!  came here with my mom recently after seeing a movie at the manor.  the ten pound apple pie looked absolutely tempting.  they call it 'ten pound" because that's how much you gain after you eat it.  we went instead for the new york style cheesecake!   m-m-m-m-m!  all of their desserts are homemade and it sure shows!

Vwhenever my husband and i are too tired to cook dinner, we call silk pagoda up!  i think he has put this restaurant on speed-dial! silk pagoda delivers up to, i believe, a 5 mile radius.\u000a\u000athe place itself is kinda non-descript.  it is in a strip-mall.  the people who operate it are very nice.  the food itself is solid, nothing much out of the ordinary, but of very consistent quality!    the mu shu is wonderful and i'm particularly fond of the standard "beef-with-vegetables.  my husband's tastes are much more esoteric.  he loves the twice-cooked pork with tofu (personally, i think that tofu is the most disgusting "edibile" substance on the planet).  he gets that when he does not want to share with me!\u000a\u000aif you choose to dine in at this place, it is a very relaxed atmosphere.  it is not fancy, but it isn't run down, dark, or dirty in there.  instead, it is a very cheerful place to have a meal.  give me a place like this any day over some yuppie "asian fusion" place!

Vyelp says 2 stars means "meh, i've experienced better", which is exactly how i felt about our dinner from here tonight.\u000a\u000awe ordered two entrees, one egg roll, and an order of cheese wontons.  the person on the phone taking our order told us it would take 30 minutes for delivery and did not tell us the price.  we live less than 1.5 miles away and called early (not during the typical dinner-time rush) but the delivery took a bit longer than 30 minutes.  the total was $29.80 before tip, which seems a bit pricey.\u000a\u000athe food was just mediocre.  the cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off.  the tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste.  the only vegetables were carrots, snow peas, and a few small pieces of bamboo, none of which were flavorful.  the gold sesame chicken is described as having a "sophisticated brown sauce", but really it was either general tso's or sweet and sour sauce.  there were two tiny broccoli florets in the dish - did they fall in accidentally?\u000a\u000ai wanted to like it - it would be very convenient for me - but it was nothing impressive.

Vmediocre chinese food in a small strip mall. i haven't actually dined inside (got take out) but it was very warm inside the restaurant, like they don't have an ac, and pretty dark. the food quality and taste reminds me of fast food chinese at the mall. i got chicken fried rice, the serving was huge but it wasn't extremely tasty.\u000a\u000ai'll probably eat here again when i'm too lazy to cook or drive anywhere, it's one of the three easily walkable restaurants by my house. (other two being subway and a pizza joint.)

Vtheir food continues to disappoint. i'm never sure what i'm getting because i never get what i order - it's always a mystery meal here. last time, and probably my last time eating here, i got chow mein but it came in 2 different containers, was soupy and full of celery, and... there were no noodles. \u000a\u000aand now that it's winter, it's extremely cold inside. and dark. also they have a $10 minumim on cards

Vi guess i'd rate silk pagoda 3 1/2 stars.  i hadn't eaten here in awhile so when i came home from dallas last week, rick and i ended up ordering delivery.  feeling pretty hungry after my homecoming, i was a little adventurous in ordering seven stars around the moon.  gotta love poetic food names at chinese places.  that's beef, scallops, chicken sauteed and chinese vegetables surrounded by shrimp.  yummy!\u000a\u000aas always, silk pagoda isn't the flashiest, but it fills the bill.

Vit was time for our comforter (queen 1200 thread count egyptian cotton) to be cleaned, we've had it done once before at owen's which is no longer in business.\u000a\u000acc is close and convenient so i decided to try there. i walked in and the clerk just looked at me until i said "hello, i'm here to drop off my comforter" as i plopped the bag onto the counter. again, i was met with a stare and awkward silence until he informed me i had to take it out of the bag, so i did and he inspected it then held up the corner were the tag used to be and shot me a look of annoyance. i told him what it was then another person came out of the back and asked me what the filling was i said i wasn't exactly sure. the woman asked if it was down, i told her no it was not, that much i did know. she also inspected it and told me it could not be dry cleaned, to take it home and wash it. i informed her it had been done before and after i said it won't fit in my washer, she told me take it to a commercial cleaner. she explained all the stuffing would go to the corners and there would be nothing in the middle so i had to get a ball to put in the dryer then sent me on my way.\u000a\u000ai took my business elsewhere and they did a wonderful job. so yes, it could be done.

Vthe chinatown inn is the last remnant of pittsburgh's chinatown.  it is the only "traditional" (as we americans see it) chinese place left in the immediate area.  i love the seafood dishes here.  i like my food simple, so i always opt for something like shrimp with broccoli or shrimp with peapods.  the egg rolls here are so good, they melt in your mouth and are not doughy at all.  my husband likes the lamb que hunan style.  i'm not sure if lamb is considered chinese, but he likes it!\u000a\u000aif you are in the mood for a salad, try the seasonal oriental salad\u000awhich is fresh asian greens with snow pea pods, chinese white raddish, alfalfa sprouts, sun flower seeds, mint leaves and topped with crispy rice noodles.

Vafter driving for 7 hours from chicago my friend alison and i had to pick up my bud natalia where she was working. once i called her to say we were close she said she had to finish up something, so we parked across from this place and waited...and waited...and waited. okay, maybe the wait wasn't that long, but the delicious smells from chinatown inn wafted into alison's car and we decided we should just go there. and go there we did! instantly i felt comfortable because this place reminded me of the chinese places in strip malls in northern virginia. there were fish in a big tank, cozy booths, and rather dim lighting. they had a lot of regulars there the friday night we went. most people were talking to the waiters like old friends. our waiter was young and adorable and looked like an anime character with his spiky hair. he showed us how to fold the paper bags into the triangle point. we were fascinated! i wish i could remember his name to give him proper props. i ate a spicy chicken dish that opened up my sinuses. i split a plain lo mein with natalia because were just in the mood. everything was hot and fresh. lovely!\u000a\u000ato note: if you happen to be an older gentleman who is bald and owns a beige sports coat, this is where your meetings are held! there were three booths in a row with one of these gentlemen sitting with his back to me. i felt like i was looking at an escher painting!

Vman, i can't believe it's been nearly three years since i'd been here.  but i had a taste for some chinese food today so i walked up here for lunch.  chinatown inn is still a good ol' fashioned chinese restaurant.  you know the kind--no asian fusion but good ol' egg rolls.  \u000a\u000afor $7.95 you can get the lunch special including soup or egg roll.  i went with the egg drop soup.  i passed on the egg roll today (i know, the heresy!).  i like my food a little more basic so i went with my usual, fresh broccoli & chicken.  and that broccoli was fresh my friends.  it had a nice snap to it.  \u000a\u000ayeah, yeah folks.  you know it's americanized chinese food.  sometimes that hits the spot though!

Vchinatown inn hasn't changed its decor or menu since i've started coming here, it hasn't changed since my mom and dad started coming here, and it's not likely to change anytime soon.  and that's the way we all like it.\u000a\u000ai came here with some of my union brothers and sisters after a training seminar.  we all had a hankering for some good old americanized chinese food and few other places around here could satisfy our cravings.  we all started out with some soups (i tried the egg flower-delicious) followed by a mix of appetizers such as vegetable rolls and steamed vegetable hand-rolled dumplings.  i went for the broccoli chicken, but we all did a little family style sharing of our dishes.  so we all did a little sampling of ginger and garlic shrimp, curry roast pork, and some vegetarian dishes.\u000a\u000ait was a great evening with some great colleagues.  oh and my fortune cookie?  it said "you are a person most generous.  pay the check."

Vi'd like to give this place 3 1/2 stars if i could.  it's a solid restaurant in a beautiful location.  i had an early dinner there tonight with my mom and sister.  the service was excellent.  we had the calamari, "dynamite" scallops, and an avocado and crabmeat terrine.  the scallops were the best.  they were cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce.  the calamari was good.  it had a bit more breading than i would like, but was cooked perfectly.  the terrine would have been excellent, but the avocado wasn't ripe.  i had the bouillabase which was flavored okay and had a decent selection of seafood, but they put in half of a crab that really wasn't that good quality.  it reminded me of crab you would receive at an all you can eat crab place.  mom had some lobster that was pretty good, but a little overpriced.  the best entree by far was my sisters.  she had the alaskan king crab legs, steamed perfectly and a very large portion.  in addition they cracked the shell which was a nice touch.  this was a very good deal for the quality and quantity at $43.  the desserts were probably the best part of the meal.  strawberry shortcake was light and probably one of the best i've ever had and the chocolate souffle was awesome.  i think the valet should be complimentary.  it's $6 for 2 hours.  if you  spend a couple of hundred dollars for three people i think they should waive this nominal fee.  they also had a pianist which was a nice touch and much better than "musac".  overall a very fine restaurant and the building is gorgeous and a must see if your visiting pittsburgh.

Vwhat a wonderful place this is to dine!  it's located in the former p&le railroad terminal and i've joked that's why my railfan husband took me here for valentine's night dinner!  in fact, the entire station square complex once served as the rail company's repair shops and offices.  \u000a\u000abut anyway, back to the grand concourse.  the hall is elegantly appointed and the restaurant features a lot of steak and seafood items.  because they are owned by meur seafood restaurants, the emphasis is mainy on, of course, seafood.  \u000a\u000ahowever i was feeling a little "red-meat carnivorish" that night and i went for the filet mignon with cabernet demi glace and mashed  potatoes and veggies.  m-m-m, medium well done meat-n-potatoes!  what more can a girl want?  oh and we began our meal with almond encrusted brie and mozzarella caprese for my salad.\u000a\u000athey do have a terrific (so i've heard) sunday brunch and a special happy hour menu.  the adjoining gandy dancer saloon also has brunch, lunch, and dinner for those seeking something a little more casual.  \u000a\u000aas i mentioned, the atmosphere here is elegant, the service impeccable.  this is not a place to come to everyday, but for something like valentine's night, it is s-o-o-o romantic!  do yourself a favor, one night get all dolled up in your finery and come here for a wonderful meal

Vohhh, the grand concourse!  definitely a place you're not gonna dine at everyday.  but sometimes a couple has to have a night out at a place like this!  read on......\u000a\u000ai borrowed an idea from a yelp friend of mine (thanks robin w.) and took my husband out here on a date last night.  i had to fly down to dallas the day after labor day for a training seminar and i wouldn't see my guy for over two weeks!  i planned it, paid for it, and i didn't tell rick where we were going!  i simply told him to make sure his best suit was cleaned and pressed.  i dressed to the nines for my guy.  i wanted him to know that i'm still his sweetheart and he's still mine and i was going to miss him.\u000a\u000a(and as a side note, on the way over i laughed to myself 'cos i thought of the episode of the simpsons in which mr. burns tells homer he should treat marge to a really nice night out.  homer says, "gotcha!  marge we're getting take out and we're doing it twice!").\u000a\u000awe began with appetizers.  i went for the almond encrusted brie  with apple chutney.  rick went for the portobello milano.  moving on to the salads, rick went for the chopped spinach salad which had chopped eggs, bacon, radishes, mushrooms & warm bacon dressing.  hmmm, you detect a theme here?  maybe we should have bacon declared a fruit.  i'm almost sorry i didn't order that, although my martha's vinyard salad was out of this world.\u000a\u000afeeling a bit adventurous, i ordered the applejack sea bass.  now that'  topped with apples and sun-dried cherries simmered in a sweet bourbon reduction; served with rice pilaf.  whoa baby, did that wake my taste buds up, but in a warm, subtle sort of way!  mmmm!  grand concourse is well known for their seafood, but rick asked me if he should order the new york strip steak.  i told him to order whatever he wants.  this was my guy's night out on me!  whatever made him happy!  that steak looked and smelled fabulous!\u000a\u000athe grand concourse is that perfect place for a nice romantic evening out.  and my friend is absolutely right.  hear that girls?  be proactive and kickstart some of that romance back in.   you've got to take your guy out some night.  plan and pay for the whole evening.  look great for him.  remind  him of why you're his sweetie!  trust me...you will "reap the rewards!"

Veight of us stayed here after taking a new years' eve cruise on the gateway clipper fleet.  we figured it'd be better to book a block of four rooms instead of facing the idiots on the highway.\u000a\u000ai have to admit that i've long wanted to stay at this hotel, however it was a little less than a four star experience.  for starters, we were booked into the newer section, which doesn't have the great views that the older part does.  okay, no biggie.  we were just staying one night.  the rooms are a bit smaller, and yes service at breakfast is rather slow plus it's rather expensif and the food is only so so.\u000a\u000aoh, but the room was still very nice, the bed was comfortable and we had no trouble falling asleep.  i'd give the sheraton 3.5 stars.

Vi'd like to give bruegger's bagels a better rating, but i can't.  there's nothing particularly bad about their bagels, but there's something a little doughy about their taste.  it's best to get them when they're hot.\u000a\u000abut the coffee ain't bad, and since this is right around the corner from work, i'll stop here on occasion.

Vit is nice to see that in this era of mega-supermarkets and internet shopping, there is still a local flower shop that does things properly.  i have been going to oliver flower shop ever since i've lived in squirrel hill.\u000a\u000athe people at oliver have been working there for years and all know what they are doing.  they can make floral arrangements for most any occasion.  they even offer gourmet baskets, starbucks baskets, get well baskets, and, well they offer a comprehensive array of services and occasions.  they even offer "plush" gift baskets too.\u000a\u000athe offer baskets and arrangements for any occasion and price range.  i recently ordered a "burt's bees" spa package for a co-worker, and all the office chipped in for this.  they also have items a-la-carte.  i stopped in on impulse on saturday to get my husband a couple of "get-well" balloons and a musical card.  he only had a mild flu and it was an impulse buy.  but, hey, i'm in love with my hubby and i knew that this would cheer him up.

Va great place to get flowers. \u000a\u000ait was my wife's birthday and i wanted to get her some really nice roses. i didn't want to get her the cheap $5 roses that the downtown street vendors sell that die before you get them home and in water. \u000a\u000ai decided to give oliver flower shop a try and i'm glad i did! i walked in and looked at all of the beautiful roses in the cooler and said to myself "now this is more like it!" i was quickly greeted and asked for a dozen long stem roses. i picked six cream and six purple roses, (my wife's two favorite colors.) ftw! \u000a\u000athe shop owner arranged and wrapped them up beautifully. but here's the shocker, when i went to pay and asked how much i owed he said $10.95! these roses are absolutely beautiful and i would have paid at least $20 or even $30 for them! he said that they have a sign outside that says a dozen roses for $10.95. i totally missed the sign. i guess my wife is right. she's always telling me i need glasses. \u000a\u000aso i paid my $11.72 with tax and in 5 minutes i was on my way. \u000a\u000af.y.i. the roses are still alive as i type this.

Vif you ever have to be around the mercy hospital area, your grub options are limited. i think there are a few dive bars, but if you're trying to maintain a professional image at work, you probably don't want to frequent those places mid-day for lunch. even if "the food is good here", people will still make certain assumptions. \u000a\u000ainstead, go to hanlon's cafe, which is right across the street from the main entrance of the hospital. i don't know who else would venture here for food besides the visitors and employees of mercy hospital because of its location. as much as i enjoyed my breakfast sandwich and listened to my co-workers compliment the sweet potato fries, i still don't think anyone would make a special trip to eat here. but if you do find yourself in this neck of the woods, the food is surprisingly good. \u000a\u000athe actual restaurant is a little strange - it sits in the middle of the 1st floor of a doctor's office / office building, and the entrance is through the staircase (i know how it sounds, but it's true and really is odd). you know you're there because their ventilation is awful. it stinks of fried oil, like you walked into the kitchen of a bad chinese take out joint. this is probably because of the location - designed originally for a doctor's office, not a local diner. \u000a\u000aanyway, cheap eats, decent food, quick bite - this place definitely serves its purpose well.

Vhanlon's is yet another place that's oh-so-close to my office yet somehow i've never gotten around to trying. i finally had the chance to stop in recently.  hanlon's has a typical diner atmosphere and they have typical diner fare, but they're pretty solid. i had me a blt and coleslaw and they were pretty good.\u000a\u000ahanlon's also does catering so i might consider them for my next office function.

Vas its name implies, the common plea is very close to the allegheny county court house.  you will see a lot of judges, lawyers, etc eating here.  as tricia s. says, the place is heavy on the dark wood and brass accents, similar to a judge's chambers.  the common plea seems to be a bit dressier, even for lunch.  it is not your typical grab-n-go place.  they do, however, offer  common plea box lunch options for business luncheons, conference breaks, or groups on the go. this includes popular sandwich or salad box lunches.\u000a\u000awith appetizers such as zuppa del giorno and calamari vesuvio starting at $4.25 and entrees such as gnocchi with pesto oil roasted peppers and spinach or cajun crusted salmon starting at $12.95, this is not a place to eat at every day.  it is, instead, a place to go for special occasions such as when my co-workers took me out for my birthday last year (last year's was a milestone).  the service here and the food are both impeccable.

Vit's been a few years since i've been to the common plea.  as i mentioned in my last review, it's not a place to dine at every day.  but common plea is one of those pittsburgh dining institutions that has been around since before i was born.\u000a\u000awe had an early holiday supervisor's luncheon here today.  we decided to have it early in december so that all of us including our field office director could make it. being that i was just promoted in october, i now felt like one of the "in" crowd.  \u000a\u000athe breakfast for lunch (frittata potato, spinach & crispy proscuitto or \u000ahot sausage, eggs & potatoes or egg whites omelet & steamed vegetables) sounded mighty tempting, but i went for the waldorf salad with cajun chicken & granny smith apples.  yeah, i know.  i've read the reports that restaurant salads are even bigger carb- and calorie bombs than entrees.  but it had meat, veggies, & fruit--that's healthy!  o' but was that salad scrumptious!

Vwho the hell stops at a brasserie and wine bar before going to an arena football game?  five hungry females who need a meetin' & eatin' place before the game, that's who!  despite its pretensions to the contrary, this is a glorfied casual hotel bar & grill.  meaning of course they jack the prices up a little.  \u000a\u000athe food here isn't bad, just a little pricey for what you get.  entrees start at $24.00, sandwiches at $9.00.  they have a special game day menu to get you in-n-out quickly if you're going to an event at the consol energy center.  but the gfs and i were here early enough to order from the regular menu.  i ordered the marriott burger which came in at $10.00 with fries.  thing is, if you want to substitute a small salad like i did, that'll set you back another $3.50.  places like this really nickel-n-dime you, that's for sure.  \u000a\u000ai don't drink, so i can't comment on the wine bar here.  as i said, food's not bad here, just a little pricey.

Vthe apollo is a decent, if unspectacular place to get basic chow.  i've been here for breakfast a few times.  they seem to specialize in egg dishes and omelets here.  i usually get the two eggs with toast and potatoes.  the nice thing is you can customize your order, so if you want, you can get eggs with or without toast or potatoes, or you can substitute a muffin if you prefer.  \u000a\u000alunches are okay here, but again nothing spectacular.  the food is pretty good, but the menu itself is rather basic.  i've had the grilled chicken sandwich and it's pretty good.  they are, however, well-known for their soups and the minestrone & chicken barley and the lemon chicken soups are their best.\u000a\u000aapollo is well-known for their catering and their rates start at $6.50 per person.  you can also order a fruit tray for about $3.50 per person.  our office has used them on occasion and we've been very satisfied.

Vyeah!  susan got up early to meet a friend for breakfast here.  imagine that!  next thing you know the pirates and cubs will be battling each other for first place and fox news will develop a social conscience!  but ever since the departure of palmers in the mid-1990s, the apollo has been the best bet for a cheap, stick to your ribs breakfast.\u000a\u000athe scrambled egg with potatoes and toast breakfast was a little unimaginitive, but it along with good coffee really hit the spot this morning.

Vapollo cafe is still a solid, unpretentious place to get a decent lunch.  i met up here with a friend of mine this past week. i opted for my usual soup & half a sandwich combo.  now my ham sandwich was good, but that greek lemon with rice soup was o-so heavenly.  their menu is right--their soups are almost meals unto themselves!\u000a\u000ai don' remember what lisa had for her lunch, but we did share an order of carrot cake for dessert.  yum!

Vso i'm reading the previous reviews... and buca di beppo is a little gem?! i'm not sure i agree with that. first of all, it's not little. secondly, it's a pretty decently known chain restaurant, so it wouldn't really be a gem in the sense that it is something to be discovered. either way, this chain does have its value. \u000a\u000abuca has become a regular place for celebratory dinners with my co-workers. we've been here a few times, but only on weekdays when it is pretty empty and easy to get a big table. the prices are pretty fair for a big group, especially after you split the meal, the drinks, and the check. the family style meal is also really fun for a big group. i like that it is a casual restaurant that allows for a dinner group to be loud and rowdy. \u000a\u000aas for the food, you can definitely find better and more unique italian food at other restaurants. at buca, the food is just mass produced on big plates so that everyone can eat like a family. everything i've ever tried is good enough. \u000a\u000aoh, and definitely get the sangria... it adds to the fun night for sure, plus it's tasty.

Vbucca di beppo is an italian chain restaurant specializing in huge portions of mediocre food, with goofy, but likeable decorations thrown around inside.\u000a\u000athere is a whole group of diners that believes quantity trumps quality and this chain is custom designed for them. food is served family style; small orders usually feed 2+ average people and large up to 4. many people feel you are getting a great value here, but personally i see lots of very cheap pasta being served and you are paying through the nose for it.\u000a\u000athe pizza's are thin crust and rectangular and did not look very appetizing due to the toppings being slung on it haphazardly and one side was a little burnt, a frozen frescheta is better than what we were served. the chicken carbonara is nothing like a regular carbonara, it is served with alfredo sauce instead the egg thickened cream sauce. \u000a\u000ai can go on and on, a lot of the entrees are pasta, red sauce and cheese, pretty common american italian fare, nothing exciting. now was the food inedible or bad - no, but to be honest the olive garden which would get three stars if i ever choose to review it. quite frankly olive garden, has better and more authentic (hard to believe but it's true) food.\u000a\u000alike i said earlier i can see this as a popular place with a certain crowd of diners, it serves it purpose and will continue to be successful, to be absolutely honest, i wanted to like it more than i did. it was a fun atmosphere and i like the concept, but i would much rather pay $14 for an entre, finish it all and be wowed, than pay $16 for a mediocre pile of food and have mediocre leftovers for the next 2 days.

Vi feel like this place is more about the kitsch factor than the food.  it's made to look like your italian-american grandmother's house, with pictures and knick knacks all over the wall a la applebee's.  there are family characters and witty sayings all over the (huge) menu.\u000a\u000athat's all well and good, but the food is nothing special.  we shared calamari (warning: they serve the rings and the tentacles.  don't order this if you're tentacle squeamish.) and the big pasta sampler of all their baked specialties--the stuffed shells were pretty good, lot of fennel and sausage, but other than that i just didn't get any big flavors from the meal.\u000a\u000ahonestly, the advertisements for italian supermarket brands (cheese, sauce, etc.) in the menu made me wish that i had cooked an italian meal for myself at home because quite frankly, i can do better than buca.

Vthis is another place i'm surprised i never reviewed before.   my brother paul and i went to the green day concert here last night.   it's now the oldest arena in the nhl, and it's beginning to show.  but you know what?  i'm gonna miss the old girl.  if nothing else, the mellon arena--okay, who am i kidding, the civic arena--is certainly distinctive.  it's odd shape has earned it the nickname "the igloo".  long a landmark, it will be replaced by simply another arena.  \u000a\u000abut, believe it or not, the igloo was conceived not as a sports arena, but for the civic light opera.  the clo wanted fans to experience music under the stars and, if need be, under a roof.  another interesting tidbit is the nickname "the igloo" is the reason the nhl team is called the penguins.\u000a\u000ai guess my judgement is clouded by sentiment.   i've seen so many great bands here:  pearl jam, r.e.m, u2, etc.  garth brooks played to sold out crowds for several nights in a row.  as the place is scheduled to close after the 2009-2010 hockey season, maybe the penguins can give us one last stanley cup championship here.

V"now you can tear a building down/but you can't erase the memories/this old place may look run down/but it has a value you can't see"\u000a\u000ai know i'm doing this review under the old name.  to me this place is and always has been the civic arena or the igloo.\u000a\u000ait's a little frayed around the edges and a little bit worn out now.  but c'mon, it's where i saw my first concert back in '89 (r.e.m. with throwing muses).  heck, i've still got my ticket stub from that one!  it's where i saw page and plant in what us up to that point the largest crowd the place had.  i've seen a lot of greats here:  black crowes, pearl jam, bare naked ladies, green day, jane's addiction, red hot chili peppers,  stone temple pilots, trans siberian orchestra, etc.  i've seen circuses, hockey games, basketball games, and ice shows here.  and last night i saw roger daltrey and eric clapton in what was probably my final concert here.\u000a\u000aand for you hockey fans, o' the memories!  three stanley cup championships, paul coffey,  tom barrasso, ulf samuelsson, petr nedved, bob "it's a great day for hockey!" johnson, scotty bowman, mike "look out, loretta" lange, jaromir jagr, and yes one of the greatest hockey players ever, #66 mario lemieux!\u000a\u000aso i raise my glass to the civic arena.  here's to you old girl!  you were a unique venue.  the cityscape on centre avenue just won't be the same when you're gone.  no matter what they build in your place, there'll be a huge void without your dome.  on behalf of the hundreds of acts that have played here and the millions of fans that came thru your styles, thanks!

Vmy brother paul and i headed over to the civic arena for what will probably be my last event here.  i bought him two tickets to the eric clapton concert for his christmas gift and i told him he can take anybody he wants as long as it's me.  i'm kinda sorta reviewing the concert here and not the arena itself.\u000a\u000ai read the reviews in both the post-gazette and the tribune-review the following day and i'm kinda leaning towards what the p-g had to say.  they said "at this point eric clapton doesn't have a thing to prove to anyone."  indeed the problem is when you've been performing for 40+ years, how do you decide which songs you're going to perform?  \u000athe paper wondered at first whether or not he would phone it in.  indeed, clapton's set was strangely subdued at first.  he led off with "going down slow" and "key to the highway."\u000a\u000ahis set also seemed short at a mere 15 songs and he didn't play two of my favorites, "pretending" and "layla".  and i've never been a particularly big fan of "wonderful tonight".  luckily he omitted a lot of those 80s and 90s tunes of his which made their way onto lite rock stations everywhere.  but he did do "i've got a rock-n-roll heart" which, granted is now a cel phone commercial, but it still gets my toes tappin'!  he threw in another favorite of mine "before you accuse me" and did an encore of "crossroads"--another great tune but that's where i was expecting "layla".\u000a\u000aand how did daltrey fare?  not bad actually for a man old enough to collect social security.  he made a great comment that this was "one-up from a toilet break at a football match."  his was a mix of the who songs and solo stuff.  the only songs i recognized were "i can see for miles" and "baba o'reilly".  i was never much of a fan of the who, but i would have liked to have seen them 30 years ago in their prime.

Vwell my previous review of the civic arena may have been a bit premature.  true the eric clapton concert my brother and i went to in february (which see under mellon arena) was probably my last concert there.  but as it turned out, it wasn't my last event.  \u000a\u000amy husband's job had a group outing at today's penguins/flyers game.  hey, half-price tickets to a great hockey game--who can beat that!  the pens didn't disappoint, beating the flyers 4-2 and clinching a playoff spot!  wasn't it a few years ago that they were in bankruptcy and on the verge of moving?  hmm, there's still a little bit of life left in the old barn, huh!\u000a\u000aso let's go penguins!  wouldn't it be great to close out the old civic arena with a stanley cup championship?

Vthis bar is basically one of the most exciting and fulfilling establishments available in the steeler nation. i know people who have spent most of their adult lives in this bar. i know people with tattoos based on the logo of this bar. i know people that won't go anywhere but gooskis, who mean "gooskis" when they say "the bar." i know of relationships and marriages that have started and ended at this bar. i have seen hearts sing, and get broken in this filthy, smoky bar. i hesitate to even tell you how great it is because i don't want to mess it up. \u000a\u000agreat bands & shows, with sweaty crowded dancing friends and strangers, excellent jukebox, amazing drinks, quality beer at ice cold temperatures poured out of clean(ish) taps, delicious bar food, prices frozen in 1981, and a diverse and interesting cast of characters seated at the bar & working behind it. watch out, though. one time a trashed drunk dude grabbed my ass, and when i confronted him, his girlfriend got mad at me and tried to fight me. this is the sort of bar where neighbors bring over christmas lights to decorate for the holidays. \u000a\u000athere's a bunch of dirty punks hanging around here, a crowd of meatheads, some normal working people, some of pittsburgh's elite intelligentsia, and so on. generally you don't find a lot of students (or "short-timers") at this bar. this is for those who bleed black & gold, with roots in the allegheny and the mon, or at least people who can adopt a reasonable yinzer accent & attitude (without irony?). plus there is some m-fing pinball ok?\u000a\u000athis is more than a bar, really. it's not fair to call it that. it's a legend and an institution.

Vi had low expectations, but i don't feel those were even met.  the food here is greasy and over-cooked, and not all that appetizing. i had the fish and chips platter, and the scallops in particular were mushy.  the service was very good.  the prices were fairly high.    i'm not a fan of joe's.

Vfirst time in here, and it's weird.  i mean where do you go that has a bar with changing closing times?  a sign above the bar basically says something along the lines that 'ryan's will close tonight at' and they have things to hang below it that look something similar to what they use to teach children how to tell time in elementary school.\u000a\u000aasides form that confusion, i really wasn't digging the vibe here.  the color was a bit offsetting to me.  could have been because it was almost all green and it reminded me of being in a hospital from yesteryear.  smoking is only allowed on the small outdoor patio area...if the windows are open.  make up your mind, allow smoking, or don't.  it's that simple, your customers who do smoke will respect your decision.\u000a\u000aprices weren't bad, and i do admit it's a decent enough place to stop on the way home to get a nightcap (if it's open that late).

Vfirst let me say that i've never stepped foot in this location and plan on keeping it that way.  i'm not one for eating alone in a restaurant, so i usually use the drive thru.\u000a\u000abeing on penn ave in the point breeze/wilkinsburg it's a little tricky to get in and out of this location.  the wait at the drive thru is usually minimal, which is unheard of for drive thrus anywhere.  the staff are polite.  the food is typical for fast food burger places.

Vit has taken me a very long time to come back here. after my last experience with this establishment i had to take some time away.\u000a\u000ai guess that time away did me some good. my most recent experience here has totally switched my opinion of this place. maybe it had something to do with the fact i dined in instead of having delivery this time. or maybe it was because i tried something other than a salad. who knows the factor this time, all that matters is that i enjoyed it. \u000a\u000asitting inside is a bit odd, not sure if they were attempting to make it a symmetrical place and it just ended up lopsided inside instead, but the flow of the place is just weird. technically three entrances into here. two via the main entrance and one in what i assume is the game room. what else is weird is that you can call your order in ahead of time and come pick it up. but not just walk right in and pick it up, you have to sit and wait. i'm not sure, but i think they don't actually cook when you call, but when you show up. \u000a\u000aanyway, those were my observations when i waited for my food to be done. after ordering you have to wait for your food like any other place, but what irked me with this place is you order your drink (mostly bottled drinks) and don't receive it until your food is ready. really?  i paid for it, give it to me, i'm thirsty now too, not just when i'm hungry.  the 'servers,' and we will use that term loosely here, act as if they have it hard taking your order, folding pizza boxers and talking into a microphone a la an amusement park ride operator. attitude, no thanks, i didn't order a side if that. lighten up, you work in a pizza shop.\u000a\u000aenough with that stuff, lets talk food. for as long as you wait, you know it's freshly made. most subs, what i opted for, are toasted, and mine was perfect. for a half, it was huge, think subway done right. something i learned while dining in, you get a pickle in the side. whereas you don't if you order delivery.  \u000a\u000atwo things about the dining area: \u000a1.  the tv seems like the volume is set so someone with a hearing aid ten blocks away can hear it. \u000a2.  leave your trays on the table. i know, odd, especially where you go to the counter for ordering and delivery of food, but just leave the trash on the table (no garbage cans out on the floor).

Vthere's something about hoagies from pizza places.  what makes 'em so good?  i've hit a lot of local pizza joints including aiello's, conicella, italian village, mineo's, monte   cellos, etc. they all have uniformly great hoagies.  \u000a\u000aso when i stopped here after doing a site visit for work, i ordered the half-sized italian sub--ham, salami & capicollo with provolone cheese.  this hoagie ranked up there with the best of 'em.  even though it was only a half, i could barely finish it.  good thing i didn't order any sides.

Vi think part of the reason i like doing the occasional home visits for my job is that i get the chance to eat lunch at local places like drew's.  such was the case when i stopped in here last week.\u000a\u000ai was mighty tempted by the hot roast turkey and potatoes, but for my money, nothin' says lunch in a diner like a good club sandwich.  i had the turkey club--basically a blt with sliced turkey.  with a side of coleslaw and some coffee, it was just right.\u000a\u000aas stated before, drew;'s has been a forest hills icon for many years.  in fact, it's been around for over a century.  in my book, drew's rates a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.\u000a\u000aps.  i think my husband rick and i will be back for greek night on november 8, 2014.

V3.5 stars.  \u000a\u000azhen choo is a typical suburban shopping center chinese restaurant.  there's no real surprises here--you'll know exactly what you're going to get when you come in here.  and i mean that in a very good way.  places like these serve good, solid americanized chinese food.  translation:  what they do, they do well.\u000a\u000ai stopped in here recently after doing a home visit for work.  zhen choo has the typical monday-friday lunch menu, with pretty much everything in the $5.00 per item range.  my general tso's chicken and my hot & sour soup was as good as any i've had.  zhen choo may not wow you, but it's got good food that'll give you good bang for your buck.

Varmstrong's is another huge-portion italian diner, this one being stuck right at one end of caste village near frisch's. i grew up close to this place, so i have been here several times - when i was younger, i thought armstrong's was a nice restaurant, probably mostly because the menu can go up to $19.95(most entres are around $14, sandwiches around $10).\u000a\u000ai have some family in town and my mom decided she wanted to go here and i agreed. so upon entering some 6 or so years(maybe more) later - 70 yelp reviews in tow and a couple of upscale dinners in my belly over the years, i was confused: vinyl booths, linoleum floors, bright cafeteria lights. what happened to the armstrong's i remember as being a nicer restaurant? truth be told, it's always been like this. the menus are written somewhat nicely and the waiters are all dressed to look about like what you'd find in an olive garden - i feel like this place is in an (perpetual) identity crisis. on one hand it wants to serve good italian food that isn't exactly cheap for the area(there are 2 or 3 other restaurants in this complex alone that are decently cheaper than it), on the other it wants to be 'the neighborhood place' and come off as welcoming and not upscale.\u000a\u000aanyways, after about 15 minutes we were quickly seated. i was forgetful of how the restaurant was so i decided instead of try and find an old flame here, i'd try something new - and settled on the linguine puttanesca, a blend of pasta, olive oil, tomatoes, olives, and hot peppers and it came with bread and wedding soup. we also got fried zucchini, a pittsburgh staple. the bread came out, half of a large loaf, along with the zucchini, 5 huge(most of us only took half of one) planks of mostly breading. both were tasty, the zucchini coming with marinara that spurred a lot of bread-dipping, and also came with a horseradish sauce which was not bashful in the least. that stuff'll kick your ass. my cousin even saved that for her entree, just in case. i gave my mom the wedding soup.\u000a\u000athe entrees came, and i was shocked to see how much food we got. i saw the other table get their food and it looked mountainous(even to eat a normal sandwich plate seemed to be an insurmountable feat), but the other reviews are right. three meals, count 'em. mine was only ok  - having been noted as 'hot & spicy!' on the menu, it was not in the least. the olives were just canned sliced olives, and overall it was just not very flavorful. it didn't taste bad, just not really what i wanted. however, the ladies of the group all got chicken salads(my turned-california cousin was understandably confused as to why french fries had found their way into a salad) which they raved about - and i do remember having a few steak salads from here years ago that i loved, as long as i got it sans-mushrooms.\u000a\u000aalso, my brother got a shrimp and scallop entree which i have to admit, was not quite so hugely portioned. he finished it with ease, but this was the only dish to suffer that fate. the waitress came with boxes, the salads barely fit in them, there was so much left. the cost was about $20/person after everything was said and done. not terrible, especially for the amount of food we got.\u000a\u000aall in all, armstrong's is just another family italian place to grab a quick bite, especially if you're a fan of leftovers or sharing. i wouldn't be opposed to stopping back for an occasion like this, but i don't think i'd hike out here on my own.

Vi had to dock a star because nothing is priced. i hate asking how much t\u000ahings are, i feel as though prices may change depending if they're having a good week vs. a bad one, the price may fluctuate...im not saying that's the case here but that's the problem...you just don't know.\u000a\u000aon to tthe review... it looks like goodwilll threw up inside but i promise you this place is full of great items. im on a quest to find a couple big bookcases (not from ikea) and a painting to go over the fireplace. i didn't find either the day i went but i did fiind some other goodies.\u000a\u000abill informed me that good, solid bookcases were rare to find...everything is particle wood these days... i'll keep my eye out. bill is super friendly, eager to help and not pushy...all qualities i love in a salesman.\u000a\u000ap.s. cash or check only!

Vfor our first visit to station square, we were looking for a place to grab some dinner before a night out at whim.  there is no shortage of restaurants in station square, but they're all (i think) chains and franchises and nothing really caught our fancy.  i remembered houlihan's from my childhood back in michigan, and the menu looked tasty, so we stopped in to check it out.\u000a\u000aboy, is this not the houlihan's from my childhood!  a glance at their wikipedia page shows that back in 2002, houlihan's revamped their concept from a cozy family restaurant to a still cozy but more trendy restaurant fit for both families and for other groups of folks.  it's still pretty casual and we felt overdressed in our club clothes!\u000a\u000athey have a large drink menu with some interesting options, like a "martini flight" that lets you try smaller portions of cocktails.  i ordered the x-rated flirtini which i was a little embarrassed to say out loud, but it ended up being a tasty, sweet, and strong concoction of champagne and vodka with some exotic fruit juices.  unfortunately, our server forgot to bring it out.  i did remind him, after our appetizers had already come, and then he went off to get it, but i was disappointed that the whole thing took about 15 minutes.  by the time i got it, our entrees were out.\u000a\u000athere is a foursquare deal here for a free order of fries when you check-in, so we took advantage and ordered the truckstop fries, which were covered in "chipotle cheese sauce."  they were tasty, and we observed that they were less salty than we expected, which was a good thing.  i definitely didn't get the "chipotle" flavor, which to me is smoky and rich.  they were clearly going for a southwestern vibe, i think there were scallions and such on the fries, but the chipotle flavor was missing.\u000a\u000awe ordered some mini-sliders that were tastier than we expected - i think the pulled pork in particular we enjoyed, and we split the brentwood chicken sandwich which was simple but fresh and well-prepared.  it was a good amount of food for two people and we were way too full for dessert.\u000a\u000ai wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but i feel like this is a good option if you are down in station square and need to grab a bite.  the menu is creative, you will absolutely find something that satisfies a craving.  even the unhealthy options taste a little more fresh, because they don't overdo the salt.  still, service was a bit slow and forgetful, and the food really wasn't memorable.  but sometimes you don't need memorable, you just need dinner.

Vchains like houlihan's have their place.  they're generally reliable, no surprises, and they're good "go-to" places if you're meeting up with friends.  such was the case when i was out with a couple of friends the other night.\u000a\u000aafter forgoing appetizers for some soup, my friend lisa settled on the brentwood chicken sandwich (could it be because she once lived in brentwood), while my friend maryann went for the salmon.  i opted for the pot roast, which i had to admit was pretty good.\u000a\u000athis houlihan's has been here for many years--ever since i was a kid.  i'd give it 3.5 stars.

Vi will preface this by saying that i am almost a total non-drinker.  this is because of my type-1 diabetes.  but i still think that this is one of the most fun restaurants to go to in the 'burgh!\u000a\u000ai really like the german food they have here.  jenney c, you may have hit it on an "off" day because i had the pot roast here and mine was very good.  the seating arrangement here, done in the "bierstube" (sp?) style, means you'll be sharing a table with strangers.  this is simply a fun place to bring out-of-town guests and the prices, while seemingly a bit high, really aren't out of line.

Vman, we had such a fantastic time here last night!  the boilermaker jazz band was playing, filling the hall with cool 1940's style swing and jazz.  i was actually glad to wait for a table, so the hubby and i could enjoy the show.  the beers were good, and i especially recommend the marzen and bock.  seating is family style, so you'll likely be seated next to strangers if the place is busy.  we like meeting new people, so talking it up with our table-mates and listening to the band made it feel like a party.  a party with 5 different types of wusrt, that is!  i highly recommend starting with the kse kugel mit speck, which is basically german mac and cheese. topped with bacon.  oh yeah.\u000a\u000ai'm looking forward to their mardi gras celebration!

Vi'd rather go here than hofbruhaus in winter (i find hofbru tolerable only during the summer, where i can sit outside far away from the accordian). the beer is, first of all, fantastic. secondly, the food is good. it's not great, but it's good. i had the pierogies and those were definitely the highlight. fresh & covered with buffalo cheese - perfect snack food. i also had fries - also good. the sole disappointment was the jaegerschnitzel. i thought mine was somewhat uninspiring - not at all up to par with the hofbruhaus - although this might be due to the fact that i used to live in munich and have high standards. my friend had the same thing and loved his. all, in all, i'll definitely be back!

Vcame up here on wednesday for a little supervisory luncheon (and note to the taxpayers, we did pay for it ourselves).  penn brewery is probably one of the oldest microbreweries/brew pubs around.  i can't vouch for their beers since i'm a non-drinker but their lunches here are really good.  penn brewery is meant to emulate a german bierstube and the atmosphere here is just so gosh darn fun, it almost doesn't matter if the food is any good.\u000a\u000awell not quite.  who wants to eat lousy food? \u000a\u000ai can't remember what the others ate, but we did start off with an order of  penn brewery beer cheese, flavored with their house brew.  i believe one of my coworkers had the scnitzel sandwich but i went for the sausage baguette--a grilled bratwurst with sauerkraut.  mmmmm, i love stinky food!  kiss me rick, darling!

Vi go to their oktoberfest every year, i would not miss it.  i love the live music, the great food, dancing, and of course the fabulous beer.  but it's nice to go back occasionally when things are less hectic and crowded, and what i get is really good german food and some of the best beers made in pittsburgh.  there's an old world taste to the beer made here and it's authentic and satisfying.  the penn brewery is a real gem!

Vpros:\u000a- cheese fondue is excellent.  chocolate fondue is excellent.  who doesn't love dipping things in cheese or chocolate?  the melting pot gives you bread, veggies, and apples for the cheese, and a whole tray of delicious goodies for the chocolate - cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows.  there are also multiple kinds of cheese and chocolate fondues.\u000a- service is really good.  if it's a special occasion, you can order flowers to be waiting at the table.  because it was our five-year anniversary, our waitress brought us just enough champagne to do a toast, at no charge.  they tucked us away in a private little booth, but we weren't forgotten.\u000a\u000athe cons:\u000a- i'm surprised no one mentioned this, but i thought the entree was really bland.  you heat up your entree in broth, which doesn't add much flavor.  it's basically diet food.  even the wide array of yummy sauces couldn't save the vegetarian entree.  my boyfriend ordered chicken, chorizo, shrimp and something else, and his came with spices already on the meats, so it was slightly better than mine.\u000a\u000athe consensus was that it would be a lot faster and a lot cheaper to come and just get cheese & chocolate fondues, and maybe a drink.  i definitely look forward to doing that again sometime soon.

Vthe melting pot has been a staple at station square for as long as i can  remember.  heck, if memory serves me correctly, the melting pot used to be in a different location at the complex.  but for all the times i'd passed it, i'd never eaten here until this past weekend.  rick and i came here with his colleague and her husband.\u000a\u000awell we started off with the wisconsin trio of cheeses for our fondue course. the fondue is the restaurant's raison d'etre (it is the melting pot after all).  m-m-m, what a great way to start a meal!  now for our main courses we could have gone with the fondue by you or the four course experience.  but we decided to go with individual dinners instead.  i went for the atlantic salmon and rick went for the sirloin.  i don't remember what our friends had, but we all agreed our dinners were done to perfection.\u000a\u000aand of course nothing tops off dinner at the melting pot better than a dessert if chocolate fondue.  remember folks, there's always room for dessert!  we tried their signature flaming turtle--milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambed\u000atableside!  whoo-hoo, give me a couple of extra units of insulin!

Vi absolutely love mandarin gourmet for lunch or dinner.  to me, it is second only to chinatown inn as the best chinese food in downtown pittsburgh.  as scott d says, they have a great lunch special menu.  for $6.75, you get your choice of chow mein (chicken or pork)  \u000amoo goo gai pan , hunan chicken,  szechuan chicken, cashew chicken, chicken garlic sauce,  curry chicken (as you can see, i love chicken!), or assorted beef or pork dishes with  your choice of egg roll or soup (i recommend the hot & sour soup) rice, tea, and fortune cookies.\u000a\u000atheir dinners are very reasonable.  most are in the $11.00 to $15.00 range.  my favorite is seafood delight which is  shrimp, scallops, lobster tail and assorted seafood sauteed with vegetable in white sauce.  when i want to splurge, i get the lobster dishes for $24.95.  the egg rolls here are fresh and they melt in your mouth.  i also like for an appetizer the pork dumplings, either fried or steamed.  mmmmm!, i think i'll tell my husband that the fridge broke and we need to go out for dinner tonight!

Vhaven't eaten here in a few years and my review needed a little updating.  okay, that's not why i ate here again recently.  i came here with my fellow supervisors because we wanted to have a little luncheon and we were all in the mood for chinese.  \u000a\u000ait's still a great deal for lunch, even though the prices have gone up a little since my last review.  most lunches are in the $7.50-$7.95 range and include choice of egg roll or soup, plus your choice of rice and hot tea and fortune cookies.  great deal, but can't i have both soup and egg roll with my lunch?  especially since i like both hot-n-sour and egg drop soups.\u000a\u000alunch here is your typical somewhat americanized chinese fare, including sweet-n-sour pork, cashew chicken, chow mein, etc.  for those of you wanting spicier fare, they've got your usual hunan beef, general tso's chicken, and shrimp szechuan style.  me, i prefer milder, more basic chow.  i went for the shrimp with broccoli.\u000a\u000aso as far as the lunch menu is concerned, there's nothing here that'll set the world on fire, but mandarin gourmet is good for a basic lunch.

Vsome pittsburghers would say that wholey's is the place to go for seafood.  i completely disagree.  coming from places where i could go out to the water and purchase my seafood off a boat, i want the freshest and best quality fish, especially if it's gonna be eaten by myself.  benkovitz is by far the best around to buy fresh seafood.  the service is always good and quick.  \u000a\u000athey also sell pre-made food (never tried it but it looks good) as well as gourmet condiments and the like.

Vi really like this place and i agree with the some of the others that benkovitz is better than wholeys.  i had some business downtown yesterday and was lucky enough to be close to benkovitz.  i usually stop in here on saturdays.  they have an awesome prepared food section.  some of my favorites are the lobster salad (great quality lobster and mayo).  i don't get it that often because it's a bit pricey. i think $28/lb.  but, a small container with a few crackers is the perfect lunch.  i hadn't been here in a while and i was happy to see that they've added more tables to the inside and they also have a few outside.  they primarily used to just have stands where you stood and ate standing up (which is fine also).  i don't really cook, so i can't speak to the prices or quality of the seafood that you can buy, but it certainly looks fresh and the staff is always helpful.  i'm pretty sure it's family run.  this place has been around for close to 100 years and i can remember going here for fish sandwiches when i was a kid with my dad.  they have great fish sandwiches, but it's not like the kind you get at other pittsburgh joints, meaning it's a reasonable size.  they have a good sushi counter, but surprisingly i've found in the past that they often don't have many of the items on the menu.  my mom also really likes the fried smelts (which are tiny fish that you eat whole (head and all)).  i like them as well with hot sauce.  i noticed yesterday that they now have a curried fish sandwich, which i definitely need to try on my next visit.  they make great soup here, but i suggest only ordering it if you get there early in the day.  i've had it towards closing time and it was like eating a bowl of glue.  yesterday i was feeling a little worse for the wear after having maybe one or two martini's to many at blue (which, btw i'd love to review, but it's not listed on this site.)  as an aside, check out blue in the nh great martinis!  and, kim is the second best bartender in pittsburgh.  anyways... they had soft shelled crabs yesterday (guess they are in season).  so, i had a soft shell crab sandwich with plenty of hot sauce and horseradish.  it was the perfect remedy for how i was feeling from the night before.  i also had the clam strips which are a much better option than fries.  really good lightly fried food with hot sauce and iced tea.  this may be the perfect next day meal after a night of too much fun.  i think the soft shell crabs are only in season for a few months, so go and check it out.  i believe it's $8.95 for the sandwich, which i think is pretty reasonable.  sit outside and enjoy the people watching.

Vwhat brought me to benkovitz is the fact that they're a seafood place that sells fresh fish, and they happen to be right down the street from penn ave fish company.  on paper they seem nearly identical, so i knew i had to try it out.\u000a\u000ai walked in and asked the guy behind the counter what to get if it was my first time.  hands down he said "fish sandwich".  but of course, it's called the "original" fish sandwich.  less than four minutes later i was seated at a table and my sandwich was inhaled.  at first glance, the sandwich doesn't seem that big.  you get two large pieces of fried fish sandwiched in soft white buns.  nothing else.  pure simplicity.  i added tartar sauce to half the sandwich and had the other half sans-condiment to see the taste of the fish by itself.  to be honest, i liked it better w/ the tartar sauce since the amount of fried fish + white bread worked to start drying out the mouth and the tartar sauce worked to keep it moist.\u000a\u000awhile i was waiting for my friend to finish his sandwich, i hopped around looking for their soups.  i sampled both soups they had on hand and i should have stopped right there.  it was my main goal to try the soups, but my gluttonous side couldn't resist a cup of their creamy scallop soup, which drank like a chowder.\u000a\u000aas a testament to how good the food is, i had my camera but completely forgot to snap pictures during my feeding frenzy.\u000a\u000aso how do penn ave fish co. and benkovitz co-exist?  benkovitz seems to have an old-school vibe with their brick walls and worn wooden floors and almost everything is fried.  penn ave seems more "hip" with brighter colors and focuses more on grilling and broiling.  is one better than the other?  that's like asking what's better between coke and mountain dew; they're just different.

Vwho doesn't love a drive thru?\u000a\u000awell, i may be the oddball out here.  i actually walked into this place instead of opting for the drive thru.  hey hey now, i hear the criticism coming from the back, but i was already out of my car at another store nearby and it felt unneeded to get back in my car to drive less than 25 feet.\u000a\u000ait is sometimes better to do this, especially if it is the first time at the establishment, which was my case.  i wasn't sure what types of brew they had within, so i would have been that annoying person at the drive thru who could not decide what to get.  \u000a\u000athey have all the basic domestics in stock, and some are in the cooler as well if you are too impatient to chill them at home.  they also have a section that has a pretty nice spread of imports.  be sure to also look around a bit, if you can't find your beer of choice, just keep looking, that's what happened to me.  also, the staff are always able to assist you in anything you need.  prices aren't bad either, about as typical as any other distributor in the area.\u000a\u000athey also do lottery here as well.

Vmy husband and i decided to have dinner at station square and afterwards, just kind of stroll around.  we decided on going to sesame inn, which is one of pittsburgh's most popular chinese restaurants--and with good reason.  the food here is typical chinese-american fare, but it is very tasty and a good value.\u000a\u000aif you read my reviews of other chinese restaurants, you'll know that i love just the basics.  oh, sure, i like to try something new once in awhile, but on the night we went, i wanted something familiar and yummy.  i opted for the shrimp with vegetables.  the shrimp was good and tender, the vegetables nice and crisp, and the white sauce not overpowering--just the way i like it.  rick opted for sea scallops with ma la sauce, which kind of surprised me.  he rarely has seafood out.  i tasted the scallops, but they were a little too spicy for me.\u000a\u000awhile we love the eggrolls here, they are the melt-in-your-mouth type, we opted for something a little different this time.  we had the fried dumplings for an appetizer.  they were not at all greasy or heavy.  rick has also eaten the boiled dumplings, saying they are delicious.\u000a\u000aas i  said, this place is the perfect blend of good food, good value, and a great location.

Vi had a little business to do on mount washington this morning.  so after stepping off the mon incline, i decided to treat myself to lunch at one of my favorite chinese places.  i opted for the lighter fare chicken & vegetables.  that way, i had room for my eggroll.  the chicken was absolutely perfect--not greasy at all.\u000a\u000ayes, i know that "lighter fare" is all relative, but that's my story and i'm stickin' to it!.

Vhow many times am i gonna review sesame inn?  as many times as i'm gonna eat there!  i took my mom and dad this past sunday to the pirates game.  we decided to go out to dinner afterwards so we rode the gateway clipper boat over to station square.  now granted i had me a hotdog at the game, but i was in the mood for a good dinner afterwards.  besides, why load up on $4.00 hotdogs and diet pops when you can go out to a good dinner afterwards?  dad feels the same way--he'll have a beer at the game, but why spend $6.50 for a miller lite when he can get some good chinese beer later on?\u000a\u000awe started off with the traditional egg rolls.  i'm sorry, but i don't consider vegetarian egg rolls "real" egg rolls.  we also split an order of pork dumplings three ways.\u000a\u000atheir seafood here is really good.  since i like sticking to the basics, i opted for the shrimp with vegetables with white sauce.  dad's tastes run a little bit spicier than mine.  he opted for the beef with curry sauce.  if it's strong enough to clear one's sinuses, dad loves it!  mom's a lamb lover--she went with the lamb with vegetables.  mom also put away a coco loco.   \u000a\u000asesame inn won't win any awards for exotic dishes, and maybe it's americanized chinese food, but if you're looking for a nice moderately priced place with good food, you'd do well to stop here.

Vmmmm!  yet another update for sesame inn!  i was going over to the byham after work last night for the richard thompson concert and i had a lot of time to kill before the show.  i'm talking about 2 1/2 hours here.  so since i was dining alone and i had a taste for chinese, i headed up to station square for some more sesame inn.\u000a\u000amy tastes aren't all that exotic when it comes to chinese.  the eggrolls here are out of this world.  the shrimp with peapods is a great choice if you just like the basics.  one bad thing about chinese (besides an hour after you eat it....) is that they always give you way too much.  i wish they had lunch portions for dinner.  good thing i was able to stop at my office afterwards and stash the leftovers in my fridge.  leftovers for dinner tonight!

Vthe google map shown is incorrect.  this place is at the point, not on the north side.\u000a\u000amy husband rick went here with a friend recently.  it reminds me that i have not been here in awhile.  it is a very unassuming, small-looking place.  if you didn't know it was here, you'd miss it.  but looks are deceptive and this place goes back and in depth.\u000a\u000athe fort pitt museum is located in a re-created 18th century bastion of the fort that great britain built in 1759, after it captured the point from the french; the outline of the french fort duquesne, built in 1754, is nearby. the museum focuses on the french and indian war but also addresses such topics as the american revolution, the whiskey rebellion of 1794, and the founding of the city of pittsburgh. \u000a\u000athey have a fur trader's cabin, a barracks room, and an artillery room to demonstrate what early life at the point was like.  upstairs, they have built a new exhibit on the long war between france and great britain, with special emphasis on the role that the point and fort pitt itself played. many original documents and artifacts are displayed. \u000a\u000athey have a couple of upcoming exhibits here that i would like to see.  one is prelude to victory: grant's defeat and it will be on september 13, 2008.  the other will be "the hinge of history: the forks of the ohio changes hands".  i love history and can easily get absorbed into this museum.  sure, it looks small, but i can easily spend a couple of hours here.

Vtime for an update.  my husband rick and i took our niece allison and our nephew brian here this past weekend.  we wanted to see the new exhibit, "american frontier rifleman: tall tales & truth", which will be here until april 28, 2012.\u000a\u000a"the american frontier rifleman" explores the truths and myths of the iconic backwoodsman.  this character was a combination of hunter, marksman, and warrior and he quickly became an icon of american literature and folklore.  the american rifleman had a resurgence in the mid-20th century in popular culture, first in the movies and later in television.  three different versions of "the ballad of davey crockett" made the top of the "billboard" charts, selling a combined total of 10 million copies.  \u000a\u000athis exhibit is really well done, displaying rare hunting shirts (the clothing most often associated with the riflemen), powderhorns and weaponry from the 1700s and 1800s, and a display of riflemen in pop culture including memorabalia from movies and tv.  it's really well done and i recommend seeing it before it leaves.\u000a\u000aas for the other exhibits at the fort pitt, many of them have undergone some much-needed renovations.  the museum has updated several of the rooms showing  life inside the fort during the 1750s and including re-creations of soldiers' barracks, a fur trader's cabin, and munitions storage.  the fort pitt is an amazing little museum that's well worth checking out.

Vthis is one of the more unusual "zoos" out there, and certainly one of the few dedicated solely to birds. the national aviary features over 600 species of birds from around the world and has some walk-through exhibits, including the tropical rainforest.  i totally agree with a previous poster in  that if you have a child with you, hold that child's hand.\u000a\u000athe collection of birds, as i mentioned, is quite varied.  including sea eagles, bald eagles, cranes, and hornbills.  my two favorite exhibits are in the east hall--the pennsylvania backyard and the tropical songbirds.  they also have a very beautiful rose garden outside.\u000a\u000athe national aviary spends a lot of time training its birds and has some of the best bird trainers on its staff.  the reason that they spend so much time training birds is to get them used to being around humans.  the staff can evaluate the birds, and take better care of them.  plus it gives the visitors a chance to interact with species that they might normally never have.\u000a\u000athe place seems small, but don't let that fool you.  taking your time and watching and observing the birds can easily take all morning or afternoon.  don't rush your visit here!  take time to notice these wonderful creatures and their behaviors.

Vthis is a wonderful place that unfortunately needs more money than it has to be in world class shape.  it's $10 to get in, and it's not large; maybe 10% of the size of the zoo.  street parking is free, lot parking is $5.  it sits in a gorgeous park next to the community college.\u000a\u000aanyways, two phenomenal large walkthrough rooms of birds, plus a dozen or so smaller enclosures that you can't walk into.  if you walked from one end to the other, it might take you five minutes, tops.  if you're interested and willing to slow down on that walk, there are 500+ birds in there, so there are definitely a lot of animals in this specialty zoo.\u000a\u000athe entire middle of the aviary is currently under construction; they're turning it into the new location for the penguins.  with that part closed, $10 felt pretty steep.  i liked the toucans, bald eagles, flamingos, parrots, and the entire rainforest room.  then again, the rainforest room felt very similar to phipps conservatory, save it has a lot of extra bird poop.\u000a\u000ai'm bumping this up to 3-stars, simply because the construction is temporary.

Vwhen my friend catherine came in to visit me this past weekend, i really wanted to take her to places that are uniquely pittsburgh.  i wanted her to see things she couldn't see in her native chicago, so i thought we'd spend a sunday morning at the aviary.  \u000a\u000awe got there when it opened at 9am because we wanted to see the "feed the lories" at 9:30am.  we each purchased a cup of nectar with which to feed the rainbow lorikeets.  they'll eat right out of your nectar cup and besides, the money spent goes towards their upkeep.\u000a\u000awhat i really wanted to see was the new penguin exhibit.  no, not mario lemiuex or any of the other hockey greats.  the new exhibit is called penguin point.  it's part of a multi-million dollar makeover the aviary is currently undergoing.  penguin point gives the viewer a complete 360 view of the penguins in action.  no, not slap shots, offsides and goals.   i mean waddling, climbing the rocks, and swimming.  the current residents have had their numbers increased and the aviary will soon begin a breeding program.  i've upped the aviary's rating to five stars because of penguin point.\u000a\u000aas great as the penguin point is, don't forget to see the rest of the aviary too.  birds are very fascinating creatures and you can see aquatic birds, flightless birds, etc. here.  this is a unique treasure in pittsburgh and you owe it to yourself to come here and learn more.  \u000a\u000aps.  the website is excellent.  it teaches you a lot about bird conservation, bird watching (i always think of the great old movie "mr. hobbs takes a vacation:), birds as pets, etc.

Vfor years now, i have been telling my boyfriend about my hopes and dreams in life.  one that kept coming up, time and time again, was that i wanted to hug a penguin someday.  i was resigned to the fact that this would never happen - where on earth would i possibly be able to hug a penguin?  antarctica?  not going there.  zoos - yeah, they have gates separating me from the huggable waddlers.  so it was just another dream destined to never come true - until my 26th birthday when my boyfriend presented me with two tickets to the penguin encounter at the national aviary.\u000a\u000ai was so childishly excited when we arrived at the aviary one saturday.  we were early for the penguin encounter, so we explored the rest of the aviary first.  i was surprised at how delightful and interesting it was - yeah it's just birds, but like - who knew birds could be so cool?  it's essentially a zoo for birds, which sounds boring, but it is not!\u000a\u000amy favorite part (besides the penguins) was going in the tropical habitat room.  this trainer gathered up a big crowd of us and did a feeding demonstration which was awesome.  only kids got to be participants - well, it was an unspoken rule, but how dumb would i look standing up there with a bunch of 5 year olds - so that was a bummer.  but wow - watching these kids throw a grape in the air and this beautiful multicolored bird swoops down to catch it.  birds were rushing past me so fast i felt a breeze by my ears.  the air was just buzzing with life, and the trainer was really knowledgeable and gave us a great, interactive show.\u000a\u000awhen it was time for the penguin encounter, i was thrilled to hear that we were the only two signed up that day.  technically as many as 8 people can do it at a time, and i would've been so furious if there were 6 dumb kids getting all up on my penguin time, but fortunately that was not the case.  we were brought to a classroom, and sat on some low benches close to the ground.  we heard some weird honking sounds coming from behind a partition.\u000a\u000aa few minutes later, a trainer (chris, i think?) came in, and opened a door to a little cage where our new penguin friend elvis had been hiding.  apparently he had been honking to alert us to his presence, and perhaps to ascertain whether or not we were also penguins (nope).  elvis waddled around us for a while, rather disinterested, but he loved his trainer.  he kept plummeting into chris's lap in this really hilarious way, flapping his wings with the sheer delight of being so close to his buddy.  to keep him still, chris had to put a hand on his beak, and then elvis chilled out enough for us to be able to pet him.  he was feathery, not surprisingly, and a very cute little guy.  whenever chris let go of him, he'd just sort of wander around and sometimes start heading away from us until chris would go "hey!  where do you think you're going?" and he'd waddle back.  chris told us lots about penguins while elvis tolerated our attention.\u000a\u000aafter a while, chris put elvis on a table and we got to take some pictures with him.  i still hadn't gotten my penguin hug, so at one point i moved in a little closer to elvis and he sort of tried to beak my face, as if to say "back it up lady, we just met!"  learned that penguins don't really like to be hugged, and they mostly just tolerate being petted (unless you are their beloved trainer).\u000a\u000aafter the photo op, we went outside with chris and watched him put elvis back in the penguin enclosure.  we watched him swim around in a showoffy manner for a while before we left.  it was a super cool thing to be one-on-one with a wild animal (and an adorable one at that), but sadly my dream of hugging a penguin is not yet realized.  but maybe i should stop wanting wild animals to be like house pets, and just be content that i got to pet him at all!\u000a\u000asuper fun day - definitely recommend the aviary in general, and the penguin connection if you are a fan of the silly creatures!

Vi can't believe there are no reviews for gateway clipper fleet!  what, you people have never been a tourist in your own hometown?  you've never used the shuttle boats to pirates' or steelers' games?  you've never taken their sightseeing cruises?\u000a\u000amy husband rick and i were looking for something different to do for valentine's day.  we took their valentine's night dinner cruise and it was wonderful!  for one relatively low price, we got a cruise down the three rivers, dinner, and dancing.  the buffet dinner was absolutely terrific.  it was your typical upscale buffet, but the food was very good, the veggies were fresh, and the desserts were to die for.  i.e.  this was not your typical "old country buffet" chow because the food actually had flavor not derived from sodium.\u000a\u000amy husband and i also danced the evening away on this cruise.  it was very romantic and he and i had not gone dancing in quite awhile.  this was the perfect way to spend valentine's night and we will certainly do it again next year!\u000a\u000aas for their other cruises, gateway clipper has captain's dinner cruises, chicken & ribs, godfather's dinner cruises, gospel brunch cruises, family picnic cruises, theatre cruises, and comedy cruises.  want to go sightseeing?  try the one hour sightseeing cruise or the lords of the mon cruise (we've taken our out-of-town guests on these).\u000a\u000aoh, one other thing, don't trust the map on yelp!  gateway clipper is not located on the north side, but rather at station square.

Vhow many other ballparks, major league or minor league, are served by shuttle boats?  very few i would imagine!  but if you're going to or from a pirates game at pnc park, you can take the gateway clipper fleet's shuttle boats from station square.  they're handy if you're eating at station square either before or after the game (as my parents and i were).  \u000a\u000aalso if you are coming from the south hills or south side, you can save a lot of time by parking at station square and taking the shuttle.  it's also handy if you're using the "t" or the mon incline.  heck, if you're a visitor or if you wanna take the kiddies for a boat ride, it's a cheap tourist attraction.

Va new year's eve dinner and dance cruise aboard the gateway clipper fleet.  what an amazing and sane way to ring in the new year!  and my husband and i, along with my cousin, my brother, my best friend, and their respective spouses did just that.  no overcrowded bars charing a king's ransom for drinks, no obnoxiously stoopid people--just dinng and dancing the night away as we cruised the three rivers!  \u000a\u000aand since we all booked rooms at the nearby sheraton station square, no putting up with idiots on the highway either.

Vthe zoo itself is pretty good, with highlights being the polar bears, elephants, and various big cats.  but the highlight is the aquarium, which would be a separate facility in most cities.  one of the best places around for photography, people watching, and, well, fish.

Vmy friend catherine was in town for the weekend, and as we had a nice day, we thought the zoo should be our first stop.  i hadn't been to the zoo in a year or so, so i was ready for a visit too.  the zoo is built into the hillside in highland park and it takes full advantage of its setting.  \u000a\u000athe tropical forest is one of my favorite exhibits.  it simulates rainforests of the amazon, madagascar, etc.  pittsburgh zoo has an impressive collection of primates and this is the place to see them.  i'm also a big fan of the african savannah.  the ppg aquarium hosts aquatic species from every type of habitat imaginable.  catherine liked the water's edge, which simulated a coastal fishing village and has two enormous underwater viewing tunnels and indoor and outdoor viewing windows.\u000a\u000aso we had a great afternoon at the zoo.  catherine was impressed, saying it was as good as chicago's zoos (lincoln park and brookfield--i've been to both).  yes, we did brown bag it here because the food isn't very good.

Vvisit the zoo during the winter, and when there is at least ten inches of snow on the ground?  yes, i am crazy, and yes, i enjoyed it.  granted, during the winter months you don't get to see all the animals out and parading around, but you do get to see how these animals interact with the cold weather/snow.\u000a\u000ai do have to say when you enter the zoo on a cold winter day it is a bit eerie.  looking deserted at the beginning shouldn't deter you.  continue on through towards the exhibits.\u000a\u000awe stopped at every exhibit that had an animal present and gawked in awe as if it were the first time we were there.  we visited each building that we could as well, the aquarium getting more time than most other places.  i mean who can argue that?  of course we spent a majority of our time watching the penguins.  how fun is that, that you get to watch them zoom by you underwater and jump up and dive back down.  (of course we laughed when one of the penguins pushed another into the water)  we also took time at the stingray pond.  who can resist the curiosity to see what one feels like (or for that matter, to crawl through those tubes and see what they look like from underneath (yes, i know those tubes are for kids)).  \u000a\u000aafterward we took our time with the rest of the zoo.\u000a\u000aone thing you should do, stop by and see the seal pup.  go to the observation window on the lower side of the exhibit and find out just how curious of a pup it is.

Va couple of years ago a co worker told me about this place called eadie's catering & market and about how delicious their cakes were. she started to bring me a different slice every payday. i can't remember what slices of cake they were but, i can tell you that they were absolutely delicious!\u000a\u000afast forward to 2014. my birthday was getting close and i couldn't decided where to get my cake from. i'm not really a big fan of moio's in monroeville and i had, had oakmont bakery cakes every year for a while now. \u000a\u000athen i remembered eadie's catering & market in one bny mellon center and how good their cakes were. they offer everything from basic cakes, cheese cakes, brownie or cookie cakes to specialty cakes and even specialty pies. i got my hands on a cake menu and made my order a few days before my big day. i went with the raspberry delight specialty cake (white cake with white butter cream icing and raspberry filing between the layers of cake.) \u000a\u000aomg!!! let me just tell you that, that was one of the best cakes i have ever had in my life. everything from the moist cake to the incredible icing made this cake spectacular and my birthday even better!

Vi've stopped here on multiple occasions and have not been disappointed.  i know this is a chain store, but i can't complain about it.\u000a\u000aeach time i have stopped in here to get an item i have actually been over helped, if that's a thing.  i know what i need when i walk into a store like this, but that doesn't stop the employees from jumping at the chance to help you out.  \u000a\u000athe last time i was here i already knew what i needed and where it was, but the guy behind the register yelled back to me that it would be quicker if i went to him and he'd get it for me.\u000a\u000a*battery dead?  they will assist you in putting a new one in.

Vcabs in pittsburgh are not like cabs in other cities.  in chicago, cabs are part of the transportation landscape.  you go stand outside and hail one.  maybe you have to walk to a busy corner, but whatever, you can find one.  not so, in pittsburgh.  on the rare occasion you see a cab, it's already got somebody inside, and you need to call.  fine.  one more reason the transit here is a total fail.\u000a\u000aso i need to get downtown on a saturday morning by 8 am.  i call a little after 7:15 and ask if i can get a cab to pick me up at 7:45.  no can do, the dispatcher says - you can't reserve times.  you call when you are ready and then the cab is dispatched.  she also told me this after i was on hold for 10 minutes so i was already cranky.\u000a\u000amaybe this is common practice - is it?  but it's really annoying.  i had no idea how long it would take the cab to get to me - if i called when i was "ready," the cab might take forever and i'd be late.  if i call before i'm ready the cab might be early and either charge me for waiting, or just leave.  but i took a chance and called around 7:30.  the lady on the phone said it'd be about 20-30 minutes and i was so angry - i called 20-30 minutes before and you told me to call when i was ready and now i'm ready and now i have to wait 20-30 minutes.  whaaaaaaaaaat.\u000a\u000afortunately, a cab was dispatched and got to me within 5 minutes which was a total surprise, but i managed to get my stuff together and get out the door when he arrived. seriously - don't say 20 minutes and then it's 5 minutes. people need accurate information!\u000a\u000aso i get in the cab, and the very chatty driver proceeds to be a complete jerk.  it takes maybe 10-12 minutes to get  me downtown, and in that time he proceeded to make fun of indian people by doing a fake accent - charming.  and then he used the word "b*tch" twice to refer to women.  joked about kidnapping the actress who plays hermione granger and bringing her home to his kids and commanding her, "do a spell, b*tch!"  and using the b-word to describe women who call cabs the morning after a one-night stand.\u000a\u000amaybe if i'd been saying racist and sexist things, it would've made sense for him to join right in, but he just said this stuff out of the blue, unprompted.  i was so offended, but when i'm in the cab of person like that, i don't feel comfortable saying anything since we're essentially alone.  but i tell you - if i ever get a cab again and he's the driver, i'd say forget it.  i'm tempted to call and complain - this guy was the worst.  i got to my destination on time at least, which is a relief since i'd hate to spend one more minute with him than i'd have to.\u000a\u000ayuck.  i don't ever want to take a cab in this city again, and i'd go out of my way to avoid doing so if this is what their service is like.

Vi have found that yellow cab can either be hit or miss.  there have been times my cab showed up on time (like a 4am trip to the amtrak) and there have been times i've waited over an hour and a half.\u000a\u000awhen tryng to get a cab downtown, i've found it best to walk over to one of the major hotels as i did the other day.

Vneed tires? look no further!\u000a\u000amy wife badly needed new tires so we went to all the local spots to compare prices, mr tire, pep boys, sam's club, flynn's etc. while leaving flynn's a woman flagged us down and asked if we needed tires and told us about discount tire.\u000a\u000aa few days later we decided to give them a try. we went with a new continental tire that had just hit the market that came highly recommended by the service guy. what's really cool is that they are like a nascar pit crew. there are actually four guys working on your vehicle at the same time taking the old tires off and mounting, balancing and putting the new ones on.\u000a\u000aless than fifteen minutes later they were done and our car was better than new! the car rides so much better and going over bumps and pot holes is so much more comfortable. don't put off get new tires and give this place a shot!

Vi agree that this place could use a re-do, as pcw states,  but sometimes if the food is good enough, it can overcome any shortcomings in atmosphere.  \u000a\u000abut pcw, you must have hit it on an off night.  i had the salmon and avocado rolls and there was a sufficient amount of fish in there and the thickness was proper.  i'm also a huge fan of shrimp tempura and i've tried their tuna rolls and they seem spicy enough for my tastes.  i also love their sake here.

Vi went here last weekend for a late lunch/early dinner type thing.  it was about 430 pm on saturday and i was visiting my friend rob's and he has told me for a long time his favorite spot for sushi is kiku.  i had been in the past, but not since i really developed a palate for sushi.  anyways, i really didn't want to like this place initially because of its tourist trap location of station square across the way from hard rock cafe, hooters and the like.  i was wrong to judge so quickly.  this restaurant basically brought sushi to pittsburgh 25 years ago and i guess they shouldn't be judged for a housing decision made long ago when places like hooters didn't even exist (a glorious time indeed).  you step into this restaurant and its like stepping into a different atmosphere completely.  you are away from the obnoxious interrogation mall lights into a dimly lit soothing atmosphere.  i think the only sound you here is water running from somewhere and the restaurant is intimate while still being private.  there is a small bar and dining room to the immediate left and further in the back there is a sushi bar manned by gents' who look like actual sushi chefs and i was told by one of the staff have over 75 years experience combined between the three.  we sit in the front dining/bar area.  the place is pretty empty due to the early hour, but this is good because it gives us pretty much free reign for rob and olga's boy alex.  the server comes over promptly. she's a young japanese girl with a big and corteous smile.  she offers warm rags and asks if she can bring anything for the boy while we decide.  we start with the sushi lovers platter for two and share it between the three of us.  it's not cheap at about $48.  however, the sushi is quite good.  the rice cooked perfectly with just the right amount of wasabi.  the fish very fresh and sliced well.  they even offer toro on this sampler.  all in all very good sushi, but certainly not the best in pittsburgh.  i'd say right now the best sushi in pittsburgh is umi (you'll pay for it though).  next the waitress brings some miso soup which is good, but unmemorable.  i was a bit surprised to see they had only one or two choices for sake and almost no wine list to speak of.  we tried some good cold sake.  it was fine, but quite expensive.  i think around $30/bottle for three small pours total.  rob and i had one each.  next we tried the "shobu shobu".  this is a fondue type way of eating in which they bring over a steaming pot of savory broth along with a side of sliced steak, noodles, tofu, veggies etc. and diners get to cook their own food.  it's a fun way to eat when you are with some other folks on a personal night out.  it'd be good for date night or friends, but i think a little off if it were for a business meeting.  the food itself is fine.  i mean the meat is okay quality the veggies seem fresh and its fun to cook yourself, but probably not a gourmet dining experience.  the cost is $21 per person (minimum of 2 people) fo this dish.  this place deserves kudos for bringing sushi to pittsburgh. it has good sushi and seemingly other good traditional japanese dishes.  my biggest pet peeve with this place is that the cost seems out of line with the location and food.  i didn't pay, but i bet rob didn't get out of there for less than $200 and we really didn't even drink.  if you find yourself in station square you could do a lot worse than this place and you should go here since its a local business and not the mega mcfunsters that seem to invaded this once fun spot.

Vkiku has a "go green" deal. if you buy your personal chopsticks for $5.00, thus saving trees,  you can save $1.00 each time you use them.   big deal!  have you seen some of the prices here?  and anyways, i always thought chopsticks were made out of bamboo, which is renewable.  \u000a\u000athat little rant aside, i was here last night for the first time in quite awhile.  a lot of the food here seems to be some version of teriyaki or tempura.  i'm not all that familiar with japanese food, so i don't know if this is the norm.  pittsburgh doesn't have very many japanese restaurants to choose from.  but feeling a little adventurous, i tried the unaju, which is grilled eel on a bed of rice with kiku's own eel sauce.  y'know, i'm glad i tried it 'cos it was really good.  all of their entrees come with their amazing miso soup.\u000a\u000aso why only a three-star rating?  it just seems that kiku is a little pricey for what you get.  as another poster says, it's one of the few non-gigachain restaurants remaining in station square.  but even the lunch menu ain't all that cheaper.

Vi love eating at kiku, i've tried their sushi about 15 times and i have never been disappointed. they have the best miso soup in the city.  the atmosphere is elegant and the service is always excellent. watch for their specials, they have an "all you can eat" night that is a good deal.

Vi remember when this theater first opened up in 1990.  it was quite a multi-plex back then and it was an era before the 20-screen behemoths we have today.  the place closed this past year, but now is opened again under new management.  \u000a\u000amy husband and i went here recently and it seems to be a decent place to see a show.  admission to all shows on monday is only $5.00 and you get a free small popcorn!  this special is good on \u000anon-holiday mondays only.  so if we have time, we will try to hit it on a monday.

Vwent here last night with my husband and some friends of ours.  waterworks cinema is still a decent place to see a show.  it's passed from owner to owner over the years and now i believe  pittsburgh theatre corporation owns it.  i couldn't find a website and i don't believe they have online ticketing.  still it's a few bucks cheaper than the amc (what isn't?).

Vi understand why everyone seems to not think so highly of this place.  but get over it people.  this is probably one of the areas best theaters to go to.  \u000a\u000ayes, it's true, the theaters don't all have the best seating.  in fact they have the classic seating set up.  which is nice.  yes, stadium seating is convenient, and makes you feel like you are sitting on top of the world, but this classic seating actually made for a better experience for me.  \u000a\u000alet us also not forget that this isn't part of one of that mega national chains.  they aren't as concerned with you earning those points for their rewards program.  what they are interested in is the fact that you enjoy your experience.  \u000a\u000amight i suggest attending here on a monday.  $5, free popcorn and ample parking.  i know what you are thinking, southside does this too.  but when you factor in parking fees at their site, you are actually paying more.  there is 3d capability here, at least two of the theaters are able to show these type of movies.  the movie selection is great as well.

Vi have to agree with darren w., frisch's broasted chicken blows every other fast food chicken place out of the water.\u000a\u000ai got the #2 which is a 14 piece bucket of the jack's famous broasted chicken which also comes with a quart cole slaw and 2 orders of broasted potatoes (pretty much roasted potato wedgies) to go. i was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which was fine with us. who wouldn't want to wait a few minutes for fresh cooked chicken verses chicken that's been sitting for hours?\u000a\u000awe were given our number and sat down. a few minutes later an older gentlemen walked by us with a killer looking italian hoagie. my wife then looked at the board and saw that it was the special of the day and immediately walked up to the counter and ordered one. \u000a\u000aabout ten minutes later her hoagie and sausage and ravioli soap arrived at our table. i went right for her soap to taste it. it was spectacular and i immediately walked up to the counter to order my own! i went with a burger and the same sausage and ravioli soap.\u000amaybe ten minutes later my burger and soap came and our chicken and sides. \u000a\u000aonce we got home we dived in. i ate my burger, a drumstick and half of my soap and my wife ate half of her hoagie and soap and a drumstick as well. we were stuffed! my burger was so big! the beef patty itself was over an inch thick. the burger was cooked to perfection. one of the best i have ever had! \u000a\u000anow to the chicken. it was still piping hot even though it took me about 30 minutes to get home. it was so juicy and perfectly seasoned. simply delicious and well worth the drive and the wait. the broasted potatoes were equally as good too. even the cole slaw was really good and i don't even like cole slaw so that should tell you something.\u000a\u000afrisch's offer a ton of other things as well including soaps, sandwiches, pizza, wedgies, calzones, wings, desserts and even a salad bar!\u000a\u000ai will be back!

Vmohan's is a penn hills institution!\u000a\u000aso it was a saturday night and i hadn't had a good wing in a while so we decided to try mohan's again as they have been voted best wings in penn hills every year for as long as i can remember. their menu has all of the usual suspects, burgers, salads, sandwiches, wraps and much more but the undisputed star of the menu has to be the wings! they are whole wings and they are huge!\u000a\u000ait had been years since we visited so much to our surprise we saw that they have expanded and more than double their space. we were quickly seated and had our drink orders taken.\u000a\u000afor our meals my wife went with the four piece fried chicken dinner which came with two sides. she choose a salad and cole slaw. the dinner also comes with a small basket of bread and butter. our daughter got a burger and fries. no surprise there. \u000a\u000ai of course got the 6 piece wings with spicy ranch dressing on the side. i also got the potato wedges with cheddar and bacon on them. the wedges were delicious and cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. now when i tell you that the wings were old the chain, they were of the chain. nice and big with a nice crispy skin and hot and juicy inside. these are by far the best wings in penn hills and dare i say the entire eastern suburbs of pittsburgh! i could only eat two wings and about three wedges as i was stuffed. i was happy to have leftover to enjoy while watching football the next day. \u000a\u000awe will be back often!

Vas the only running store in the pittsburgh area, it's totally worth the short drive. flexible return policies, custom shoe fittings, and $15 back on every $150 you spend. i got fitted and bought new shoes there along with superfeet insoles, so far (9 runs) i'm loving them.\u000a\u000aon the way back you can even stop by the dormont swimming pool, with slides!

Vthis is one of my favorite spaces in the state street area.  i used to have regular lunch and dinner dates here with friends, chatting away the winter afternoons to endless cups of hot tea and warm soup.  it's a nice respite from the wind chill in the winter, construction in the summer, and craziness of state during the academic year.  the lighting is dim, the music is soothing, and the tea is hot, spiced with cardamom, and free (the refills will keep on coming too).  my favorite waiter is long gone (left in 2006 for better things in milwaukee) and the service can be a bit slow and inconsistent but the falafel is consistently good -- crispy on the outside, spicy, hot, and moist on the inside.  i often go for the arayis beef sandwich (approx $7, summer 2008) for a filling lunch that will keep me going at the library through night.  the kefta is also quite nice.  if you go super hungry with a few people, the m'hamara is far above average!  two brief warnings -- the prices have gone up nearly every two years since 2004 and on one occasion the restaurant was closed unexpectedly for nearly 6 weeks.   falafel sandwiches (with crispy and above average fries) used to be only $3!!!

V*note 1:  this review is for the food and restaurant only -- haven't experienced the bar* \u000a*note 2:  this review is based on a horrifyingly memorable experience from 2005*\u000a\u000awinter, blustery, below 0.  i wanted a bowl of piping hot soup, my friend lived in the apartment above amy's cafe.  we entered the establishment.  quiet, dirty, napkins on the floor, old food crusted on the tables.  i ordered the broccoli cheese soup, they served me luke warm velveeta with a handful of frozen broccoli and a rock hard "baguette."  yuck.  inedible.  two stars simply because my friend finished her sandwich and  i liked her pickle.

Vgross food.  even for state street the food is gross!   avoid the turkey burger at *all* costs.  in fact, even the salad is not quite worth the price!  in terms of the bar, i've only ordered a beer on tap but the service left much to be desired.  food with drink will be over $10.

Vi took the advice to come for breakfast and loved it. service is was bright and friendly. \u000a\u000athey have different breads depending on the day of the week. there is a mix of some great items on the menu for breakfast. decadent items such as different omelettes, sour dough french toast, the bakers breakfast with eggs and ham. the coffee is great and the pastries are even better. the danishes and croissants melted in our mouths! \u000a\u000at-shirts, aprons, and tote bags are available for purchase. pretty good quality i'd have to say. the bags also have a story behind it.

Vi've never had anything really unique at the courier cafe, but everything i've eaten has been solid, steady, and delicious.  i just love getting off-campus for brunch, and indulging in food that tastes like it was made by someone's grandma.  when i visited campus last weekend, i went back for sunday morning brunch, and enjoyed the courier breakfast - 2 eggs, 4 half-slices of toast, potatoes, and bacon.  eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp.  problem with that?  no.  it's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but i got exactly what i wanted and i enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time.  i'd always come back here for brunch.

Vi like crane alley.  i think i would go there more if i lived in urbana; living in deep west champaign i never really feel like it has anything to offer me that i need to drive to urbana for.  i like their food alot (especially balsamic spinach strawberry goat cheese salad ah!)  and think the vibe is pretty nice:  clean, waitresses cleavage unexposed, no patrons likely to puke most of the time.\u000a\u000ai've had really slow service there alot of times, especially up in the loft.

Vi fly quite regularly down to phoenix (used to go direct to tucson, but express jet went bankrupt) and i am stuck with us airways as being the only non-stop from spokane. with that being said i have never had an issue with them. but this last time really fried me and my traveling companion.\u000a\u000awe showed up at the phoenix airport check-in counter 1 hour and 16 minutes before our flight was to leave. we had tried to e-check-in the night before but the system could not find our return reservation. \u000a\u000afor over 45, yes fourty-five minutes we worked with a representative and then their supervisor do find our reservation. we had the original receipt with the confirmation code but they could not find either one of our tickets.\u000a\u000alow and behold at exactly 29 minutes before the flight was to leave the supervisor looked up and said "well here is your reservation, but i can't issue you a ticket!" \u000a\u000a"why not"\u000a\u000a"because you got here too late, you must check in at least 30 minutes before your flight leaves and you (she did stress you) didn't do that."\u000a\u000ai am not kidding you. it took us another 10 minutes before she would issue us a boarding pass for the 830 pm flight (note: it's 10 am now a full 12 hours to wait). we made a mad dash for the plane zoomed through the security and showed up at our original flight, only to be told that the flight was closed and there was nothing they could do. so we waited and watched the plane sit at the gate for 23 minutes before it finally pushed back.\u000a\u000awe went to customer service and were told again: "it is our fault for not arriving early enough." and "you should expect computer glitches and get here earlier, it's not us airways fault."\u000a\u000athey had the audacity to tell us that we should arrive at least 4, yes four hours before a domestic flight with carry-on baggage only. imagine if we were traveling international with checked baggage, should we be at the airport 24 hours in advance????\u000a\u000aus airways gave us no meal vouchers for their screw-up and while we waited and waited we watched two different times that the doors were re-opened on a closed flight for passengers that got there late.\u000a\u000athey had no apologies, except to blame us for their computer error; they did nothing to help us out, meal vouchers, etc. they ignored our request for seats near the front of the plane; i was in the 2nd to the last row (22), while stand-by passengers for this flight received rows 7, 8 and 11. \u000a\u000ait will be a cold day in hell before i fly on this airline again, i will change planes, i will wait extra, i will do what it takes, but never again will i be told that their computer problems are my fault.

Vload up on the beer and gordon biersch garlic fries. that is all you will need for the rest of the night. if you'd like you can always enjoy some glazed chicken wings, southwest egg rolls, seafood cobb salad, gorgonzola bone-in ribeye, grilled chilean sea bass, halibut oscar, chicken parmesan, meatloaf, and more! did i mention the gordon biersch garlic fries?\u000a\u000aotherwise, you can count on feeling like you are in a typical sports bar filled with local strangers.

Vhad a long layover here and decided to venture about this airport. and see the sights that i could from the airport windows...and also take in the many shops located along the corridor.  i do have to say that i had to resist the urge to gamble at the slot machine sitting there.  even if they were tormenting me to play and keep inserting my money.\u000a\u000abeing late at night when i was here i was able to venture without bumping into people.  made it nice to be able to see everything there was to offer.  of course i browsed a few stores and got a bite to eat during my wait.  but the nicest thing was being able to sit there and not hear all the noise you usually do during the daytime.  if only all airports were like this.

Vi am a big fan of the monorail. it is very fast and convenient. a train comes every few minutes so you never wait too long. i wish you could catch it from airport like the marta in atlanta. some of the stations are a really really far walk through the casino to get to.

Vthe original name for the project was le rve but was changed to wynn las vegas well before the project was complete. built at a cost of $2.7 billion, it was the largest privately funded construction project in the nation. roger thomas was the interior designer for the hotel and he designed many of the public spaces as well as the majority of components of the guest rooms and villas. \u000a\u000ainterestingly, the building is the first high rise to be cleaned by an automatic window washing system. \u000a\u000ai stayed here on my birthday in 08'. they put me in a room facing the strip on the 51st floor which was nice but i expected a little more like a bottle of wine or a fruit basket or something! i am a red card member and i don't gamble alot but i spend alot of money everytime i'm here after all! \u000a\u000athis is the most beautiful hotel, casino i have ever stayed at! everyone was pleasant and helpful. the free shuttle from the monorail station is a nice touch (i heard they don't offer it anymore). the free drinks are good and stiff. the food was great everywhere i went! i didn't get to go to tryst or the lake of dreams this time but, i had a great time at blush. \u000a\u000athe doorman even took a picture of my friend and i with my camera without even being asked! now that's service! they now have a app for android and the iphone. they are also on twitter @wynnlasvegas. \u000a\u000awynn has just started to renovate all of their 2700 rooms starting from the top down at a cost of $99 million scheduled to be done by april of 2011. they are also scheduled to remodel the baccarat area starting in october to be finished by christmas 2010. daniel boulud brasserie will be replaced by lakeside cafe by october 2010 as well. \u000a\u000ainsider tip #1: ask a cab driver to drive you down to the cab waiting area under the hotel. there are indy race cars on the walls with sounds of the engines revving. a very cool thing to see! \u000a\u000ainsider tip #2: be sure to put in your info in the guest book section of the wynn las vegas website. you will get all types of offers for discounts on rooms and food.\u000a\u000ai can't wait to stay at encore! \u000a\u000ayes city center is newer but you won't get the "wynn" treatment there! trust me!

Vkennywood!  ah kennywood!  how do i love thee?  let me count the ways....\u000a\u000athat kennywood park is one of the last and oldest traditional amusement parks around is enough to give a five-star rating.  no "themes", few characters, and the emphasis is just on having good ol' fashioned clean fun and being a kid again for a day!\u000a\u000aif you've read some of my earlier threads, you'll know that i, susan d, am a rollercoaster daredevil.  there's no rollercoaster that i can't tame!  but more on that in a moment.  let's begin with the "next best" group of rides, the "classic" thrill rides.  why is it that the oldest thrill rides are the most fun?  i'm referring specifically to "the whip", which was built in 1919--yes the ride is almost 90 years old!  it's a good ol' fashioned  "crack-the-whip" ride, which 16 cars  travel an elliptical track and "whip" the riders as they go around the bend at either end.  it is nasty!    then there's "the kangaroo", which simulates the effect of a kangaroo jumping. once a regular in amusement parks, it is the last remaining of its kind.  wicked!\u000a\u000awant to get wet?  kennywood has three rides that will take care of that!  "raging rapids" is your typical rapids ride.  "log jammer" is still there too.  my personal favorite is the "pittsburg plunge"  (no 'h' at the end--that's how the city was originally spelled).  this is based on a ride at the old riverview park in chicago in which several people are seated in a boat that hurtles down a chute towards a big splash at the end.\u000a\u000aand finally, as promised, we come to the rollercoasters!  these are why i go to any amusement park.  which are better, the clanky old coasters from the 1920s or the smooth steel coasters of today?  or is it a moot point?  naturally i have to ride each at least twice--once in front for the view and once in back for the g-forces.  "the racer" is a twin-racing coaster from 1927.  next is "the jackrabbit", from 1921, with it's notorious "double-dip".  then we come to "the thunderbolt", still a perennial in every roller-coaster aficionado's "top-ten" list.  finally, there is "the phantom's revenge"--a refashioning of the 1991 "steel phantom".  i'm still undecided on whether or not iike the new version better.  one thing is for sure, i do miss the "steel phantom's" loops.  but on this coaster, the biggest drop on this ride is not the first but the second.  it drops 230 feet and reaches 85mph!  oh, and the second drop is hidden, so if you're riding with a newbie, don't tell that person!\u000a\u000aoh, and i like the merry-go-round too!

Vso i was back at kennywood again for opening day.  this time i was a little disappointed because, try as i might, after making a beeline for the phantom's revenge, i didn't quite make the first trip of the season.   and i didn't even get my choice of seat (front for the view or very back for the g-forces) because no one else in my party wanted to ride the coasters first thing.  (the wimps wanted to "build up" to it).  so i was paired up with someone.  my fault--not kennywood's! \u000a\u000aoh well, there's always next year and as a yelp friend of mine pointed out, i can always camp out to be first in line.  although i think kennywood's management would frown on that.  in the meantime, read my original review, then get out there and experience for yourself one of the last "traditional" amusement parks!

Vi had to knock a star off because of all the changes over the past few years. yes, it is changing to keep up with its competitors but in my opinion kennywood has prided itself on being kinda old fashioned and nostalgic. they keep taking away from that and putting in new hokey crap. (what's the deal with that shoot 'em up interactive thing) and they took out past time (i'm sure me and my grammy are the only two people that will miss it, but it added so much charm) to put in games that they already have at the other end of the park?! remodeling noah's ark was just unthinkable. \u000a\u000aplease don't misconstrue my ranting, i still love going to kennywood. it's great for the whole family or group of friends but because i've been going since i was in utero and have seen all of the changes, it hurts my soul a little bit each time i go back.\u000a\u000aadmission rates are becoming ridiculous - they need to put a cap on that asap. thankfully, they have the night rider passes which gives old fogies like us just enough time to circle the park twice, ride our favorite rides and stuff our faces with pp fries, corn dogs, and funnel cakes.

Vthe racer is kennywood's second oldest rollercoaster after the jack rabbit. built in 1927, it's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster. what's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster? well it's a racing coaster that appears to have two continuous loops (ala the american eagle at six flags or the gemini at cedar point), but really has only one continuous track. so you end up on the opposite side of the station from where you started. there are only three remaining coasters of this type in the world. the other two are in mexico city and blackpool. \u000a\u000athe racer was designed and built by john miller and its trains are classics built by the philadelphia toboggan company. ptc built some of some of the most famous coasters and their trains. its tallest vertical height is 76 feet, its maximum drop is 50 feet, and its top speed is 40mph. of the three woodies at kennywood (this, the jack rabbit and the thunderbolt), the racer is the only one in which the initial hill is also the lift hill. when built, it cost the then-princely sum of $76,000! imagine what the designers back then would have thought of what the newest coasters cost! \u000a\u000aready to take a ride? \u000a\u000aokay, let's get on the train on the right! it doesn't really matter where we sit on this one, so maybe we'll just park in the middle. the alarm bell rings, the brakes are released and we begin rolling towards the lift hill. we won't see our opponents until we're almost on the lift hill. the lift chain catches and we're inching our way up the hill. we're about a foot in front of them. we see the warning sign as near the top telling us not to stand up. well duh, but i'll bet some moron has tried that! \u000a\u000athe lift chain releases and we we're down the first drop, then a quick ascent, then a reverse curve. because we're on the inside of the curve, we pull out to an early lead. uh oh, that can't be good. read on. we keep our early lead for awhile but remember, sometimes we're on the inside curve, sometimes on the outside. the great thing about the racer is that some of the curves are so tight, we can reach out and high-five our opponents http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:racer-handslap.jpg remember, it's not a tradition--it's a requirement! \u000a\u000athe present racer replaced an earlier one built in 1910, which was a side-friction coaster like leap the dips at lakemont park. the present racer's cars are locked to the track, thus allowing banked curves as well as dips on the curves. we can see how this has come into play 'cos even though we've been ahead, on the final curve our opponents have pulled into a late lead and are first back into the station! \u000a\u000ashite! we lost! \u000a\u000athe racer really doesn't have the g-forces or the airtime hills of the jack rabbit or the thunderbolt. it doesn't have the thunderbolt's speed or wicked drops either. but it's still got a great rough ride and it's still a blast. the racer is an ace (american coasters enthusiasts) classic and on june 21st, 2010 the racer was declared an ace coaster landmark http://www.aceonline.org/census/photodetail.aspx?id=9628

Voh kennywood, how i love thee.  i'm not just saying that because i am a born and raised western pennsylvanian.  i'm saying that because even though the size of your park is on the smaller side for an amusement park, there is never enough time to possibly cover everything there.  thus making sure you need to come back again and again to enjoy everything if not for the first time, but as a repeat adventure.\u000a\u000asadness comes and goes here as i can remember where certain rides use to be and are now replaced with newer rides...*le sigh* how i wish the pitfall were still there or the rotor for that matter.  but some of the newer rides were well worth the sacrifice of the old.  \u000a\u000aof course you can't get rid of the awesome roller coasters such as the thunderbolt, racer or jackrabbit.  especially since they take advantage of the natural ravens in the area.  even the phantom's revenge takes advantage of the awesome hills here.  some of the classics are still there, i don't think i have ever ventured here and not gone on noah's ark, even though i know what to expect, it's like i have to ride this.\u000a\u000athis is also one of the few amusement parks where you don't have to rush yourself.  if you want to take a leisurely stroll, you can.  why?  because it's actually a beautiful place to walk around in.  the pathways are nicely lined with plenty of shade if you want to take a rest from the sun.  \u000a\u000amemories come and memories go, but i guess you can say the one thing that remains constant is that kennywood will stick around for who knows how long.

Vthere's magic in kennywood.  it could be because it's a pittsburgh tradition, or because they have some of the most amazing wooden roller coasters in the world, but i absolutely love kennywood and it's always fun to go.  today there was great weather and short lines, and that is as good as it gets.  i like how kennywood has preserved many of the historic rides, as well as innovated some new rides as well.  the potato patch fries are legendary, and they are delicious because they are fresh cut and cooked in a very traditional way.  if the line is long, check out the small fry next to the lost kennywood gift shop.  the fries are made exactly the same as the potato patch, but the lines are much shorter.

Vbest bar for a wide selection of beer in pittsburgh, and a strong claim to "best belgian beer bar in the usa".  \u000a\u000agood bar food, on the pricey side.  \u000a\u000awhen they're busy, the service is slow.  actually, when they have more than a small handful of folks in the building, the service is slow.  \u000a\u000athat said, it beats the hell out of the brickskellar (similar bar, in dc) on speed of service, food quality, and variety of beer available.

Vi have only been to sharp edge for late night, and will review it accordingly.\u000a\u000ai first started going to sharp edge two years ago.  back then we would order the entire late night menu (which runs from 10 pm - 12 am) from buffalo bites and wings to mediterranean nachos and their pomme frites.  they no longer have wings (which were my favorite), but they still have quite a large selection of bar food.\u000a\u000athey also have a large expansive drink menu.  the only downfall is their service can be on the slow side even if the restaurant isn't busy.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended.

Vfirst bar stop once i got into pittsburgh - beer emporium!!! they have a decent selection of belgian beers on tap and more in bottles as well as american microbrews. we got two samplers and had the bartender  help us out with choices. i also got the buffalo bites in cajun sauce with blue cheese dip - they were kinda average, pub-food fare. the creme brulee stout was interesting, very sweet and smelled like butterscotch. the rest of the beer was a big blur, i was overwhelmed with all the different types we got. next time i'm sticking to one kind at a time.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is less than i expected, i had visions of monk's kettle-esque bar and this is more of an old american pub, leather and wood, simple. the bar doesn't have coat hooks, boo!\u000a\u000athey have a great happy hour after 10pm on weekdays, the food menu is half-price and they twitter what new beers they get and what's being replaced.

Vi'm pissed that i didn't realize it was a serious beer bar until after i had already ordered my perfectly fine but unextraordinary blue moon, and that i was driving so i didn't get to try any of the other awesome looking options.  i'm also pissed that i ate dinner before i went and didn't get any of the huge pile of tomato, garlic, and feta pizza that was shared around me.  so i guess that this is more a review of me being an idiot than of sharp edge.  i guess i'll have to go back and try to not be my own worst enemy for a change!

Vthis place has a great beer selection, especially belgians but it's a bit pricey compared to other high-end beer joints i've visited.\u000a\u000athe food is...forgettable at best.  i had a buffalo chicken salad.  not spicy at all, no buffalo sauce anywhere, basically iceberg lettuce and black olives with soggy fries on top.  ugh.  \u000a\u000athe husband enjoyed his mediterranean chicken pita thing and gets a kick out of drinking czech lager.\u000a\u000ahigh point of the night: i ordered the "mystery brew" which was a lovely, reddish-brown hoppy concoction this week.  wish i could tell you what it was!

Vi've gone once during happy hour for a beer, it was good, and since it wasn't crowded the service was decent but i will echo that if you sit behind the giant taps, you probably won't get good service since the bar tenders can't see you.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere seemed nice, there are a couple large tvs behind the bar, all of them were on sports channels. the bar is long and covered in beer taps. they also use the correct glassware for most of the beer they have which i thought was neat.\u000a\u000ai counted 52 taps, and if i recall correctly it is half off belgians 5-7, and half off all us micros on wednesday(all day).. i'll admit though, if you were to come off of happy hour, it is quite a pricy place. i'll have to try the food next time i'm around.

V3.5 rounding down \u000a\u000ai looooove me some belgian brew and there is no better place to indulge than the sharp edge. a great tap and bottle selection sure to tickle everyone's fancy - light, dark, white, pale, lambic, hoppy, spicy, fruity...i can go on, but i digress. \u000a\u000atse doesn't stop at drinks, they serve food as well. on our most recent trip, jb and i started off with the mediterranean nachos - creamy spinach artichoke dip, tomatoes, black olives and melted cheeses top off thick pita chips that are soft and chewy in the middle (without being a soggy mess) and fried crispy around the edges for great texture. the nachos may lean towards the greasy side at times and they would also be 5 star worthy if kalamata olives were used instead of run-of-the-mill black...regardless, they remain consistently delicious despite these small areas of concern. \u000a\u000afor dinner i ordered the portabello panini on foccacia with pomme frites. the "foccacia" turned out to be nothing more than sliced white bread with the crust cut off and the frites are just fresh cut french fries. i highly doubt they use the double fry method because the potato sticks lack that extra crispy exterior and soft interior. i also suspect they use veggie oil instead of animal fat to fry them in so they really shouldn't call them frites. \u000a\u000ajb had the belgian burger with onion petals. the petals seemed to be frozen and fried but he was overly satisfied with the burger - lamb, bacon and gouda...sounds like a lovely combination even to me. \u000a\u000atse also has a fabulous happy hour - 1/2 off belgian drafts...yes please! and $1 off bottles. the selection, as i mentioned before is amazing. our waitress was sufficient, coming around when needed and not overbearing. \u000a\u000aif tse could master all their dishes, not just what they're known for, this would be a 5 star establishment. too bad it seems like they focus too much on the apps and belgian/mediterranean items...i know that's their specialty but if you're going to offer other options you better put the same amount of love into them.

Vfrom my 21 check-ins, you can probably tell that i've been here quite a bit since my last visit - so i figured it was time to update this review to let people in on all i know about this place. as i tell people at the elite events, many times over apparently, i live literally "this close" to the sharp edge, so i go fairly often - at least once a week. sharp edge recently underwent a makeover - enter and you're greeted with a large l-shaped bar, a sectioned off seating area to the right, and a large expansion in the back which is also seating. it can get crowded at times, but if you're only two-people deep you can pretty much walk in whenever.\u000a\u000afirst thing's first: sharp edge is expensive for what it is. beers here are definitely on the high end($5+ is the minimum, $8-11 is the upper end) and the food is generally over $10. while i think the beer can be worth it, especially if you make educated beer decisions(hint: that $6 magic hat probably isn't on the 'good-buy' list) - the food leaves to be desired for what you're spending. i've found the service to be spotty at worst, good at best. the bar has great service when they get around to you, and to an extent same with the servers - but it seems slightly inconsistent that some servers are a cut above the others.\u000a\u000asomething magical happens to sharp edge a few times a week that catapults this place into pittsburgh's best spots. every night after 10pm, sharp edge has a late-night menu where many appetizers are half off, including large pizzas and some other times. that means that you can get their amazing mediterranean nachos(seriously, these are worth it) for about $5, a large pizza for $6, 'frites' for $3.50, and what i just learned tonight, the $0.45 boneless wing bites also come in a tofu version.. that's right vegetarians, nearly the entire late-night specials menu has at least a vegetarian option. can't go without the chicken? they choose natural stuff from ohio.\u000a\u000aas if the food deals weren't enough to entice you, every wednesday all day, all craft beers are half off(bringing them down to about $3-$4 each). can't make it in on a wednesday, you say? why not stop in for happy hour - half off belgians make them cheap by comparison($4-5 each). unfortunately, they do their happy hour a half hour early - 4:30-6:30. if that's too early for you, stop in any time and enjoy their mystery draft. this is one of my favorite things about this place - a beer that you order without knowing what it is. at only $3.50, it's the cheapest on the menu - usually something good too. how do you know what it is? come in after the keg is kicked and they'll write down the last one on a chalk-board. for example, the last mystery beer was a peak organic ipa.\u000a\u000athis place can get crowded, but if you're brave enough to come during a steelers game they also have specials for that. the mystery drafts go down to $0.86 each if hines ward scores, along with a handful of other deals.\u000a\u000aall in all, sharp edge excels if you know when to come. i find myself in here almost every wednesday, at least, but sometimes more. if you come thursday at 7:30, be prepared to be underwhelmed, but the sharp edge is a great neighborhood bar with an excellent and often-changing beer selection that you can come out ahead at if you plan it right.

Vi'll be the first to admit that i am not a huge warhol fan, but even i appreciate that this museum exists in pittsburgh.  if you like warhol, this museum will be that much more enjoyable for you!  \u000a\u000aif you are a student, remember to bring your id as this will get you $7 off admission.  or, even better, visitors should wait for good fridays (every friday) where there is half-price admission after 5 pm.  more, there is a cash bar, which makes this even a fun place to go and check out some eye candy (art and human both) or to bring a date.

Vi've lived in pittsburgh for what seems like forever, and i have gone to the warhol a zillion times. oh pittsburgh, we all love andy warhol so much even though he tried so hard to get away from this place. \u000a\u000ai have seen some amazing bands here. the musical offerings are not predictably my taste, the styles are varied and meet a high standard. the theater is a nice setting for bands, although i've seen it near destruction with some rowdy crowds. \u000a\u000athe post-warhol art shows are generally impeccably curated and i always come away with fresh ideas & inspiration to return to my daily grind. the gift shop is full of surprises and cute stuff, although it leaves more of an impression when it is novel. the cafe, also, is full of novel surprises with their edible, vegetarian-friendly stylin'. \u000a\u000adate highlights: making out in the most beautiful matte black & white photo booth in the city! cuddling on the weird squishy couches! playing in the room with the big silver balloons/clouds floating around! the cloud room is just generally my favorite. making eyes over great food, and holding hands walking across the bridge to the north side. \u000a\u000ai've gone to exhibit openings here, performed here with my dance troop,  attended parties, and exhibit closings. i've brought children, good friends, classmates, groups, and romantic dates here, and everyone has a good time. some of the art on display can be explicit - like anything, you should review it first and be prepared to talk with your kids about it if they see it. plan to spend some time in the six floors of this museum, and be prepared to stretch your mind out, at least a little, in some new direction.

Vso like....am i missing something here?\u000a\u000awe walked in the door, and the place smelled amaaaaazing, like a huge pot of rich chocolate simmering away.  i was super psyched to eat some biscotti - we got a half dozen, and they were very well priced (like $7.50 for six, i think?)  all well so far.\u000a\u000aso then we get home, eat dinner, and we are pumped for dessert.  how surprised and disappointed we were to find that the biscotti were totally plain.  though we had gotten six different, very unique-sounding flavors, we could not distinguish one from the other.  the texture was great, but it tasted like what i can only describe as "plain biscotti."\u000a\u000ai'd love to give more stars to a local business, but like....it was just plain.  barely a hint of flavor.  i'm totally not making this up or trying to be bratty or snobby - i'm not exaggerating at all.  the stuff was totally boring.\u000a\u000ai see another reviewer here said exactly what i said, so i know it isn't just me.  maybe we've been on a bad day?  i'd be willing to give it one more try, but if it's plain again - then me and enrico's are done.

Vthe cafe has the best lunch you can buy in pittsburgh.  the beans and greens ( kale, cannellini beans, garlic, olive oil) make a great appetizer.  the salads are marvelous.  the bread is artisan.  the soups delicious.  and the desserts are outrageously wonderful.  i sometimes order the cannoli with goat's milk cheese, but sometimes the macaroons.  sometimes they will come by your table with a wine tasting, although i am not crazy about their wines.  you can also bring a bottle of wine if you wish.  the food is consistently great here and the prices are reasonable.

Vhow have i  never been here before, considering that i am a black and gold city yinzer?  well, this oversight was revised this morning.  i got here about 10 am this morning and totally expected a long line.  we only had to wait about 5 minutes and got a great booth in the back.  if you're in a rush sit at the counter.  service was friendly, quick and professional.  place was packed with all types, classes and colors.  everyone from family's after church to folks like me with disheveled hair wearing the same clothes from  the long night prior.  this offers a true snapshot of the folks of my fine city.  i ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs with a side of sweet sausage and toast.  the corned beef hash was great charred perfectly and tons of flavor.  the eggs were about average and the sweet sausage was amazing.  they offer a ton of breakfast meat options, everything from chorizo to amish ham and sweet sausage.  my breakfast was a little above average, however my friend made a much better choice.  she ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was great.  it was served on fresh italian bread with mounds of cheese and crispy bacon.  i like pamelas for pancakes, but for just true good diner breakfast food this is my new favorite.

Va pittsburgh institution.  i recently went on steeler sunday around 10am -- the wait was less than 5 minutes and the service still adequate (constant coffee refills).  the sausage is delicious.  try it on a fried egg sandwich but be prepared to take some to go.  it's dirty, greasy, and packed full of pittsburgh nostalgia just like a greasy spoon should be!  (fyi - cash only)

Vi had a mixed grill (was feeling particularly carnivorous that day) and it was good.  loads of meat, served with grilled veggies and potatoes.  i couldn't finish it, and ended up taking some home, and it proceeded to be my breakfast for two days after that.  \u000a\u000athe breakfast meats are pretty good, and the prices are good too.  standard diner fare, with a little more of a busy atmosphere.

Vmeh - nothing special just a greasy spoon diner serving up decent but very average breakfast. hollandaise sauce out of a mix, average potatoes, average pancakes, really nothing to the place except it is a pittsburgh icon, much like primanti brothers, it's legendary for what it once was not for what it is now.\u000a\u000ai'm glad we didn't wait for breakfast and if i was going show off a breakfast spot in pittsburgh i think pamela's would be my first choice.

Vthis is a good spot and a good choice for the big burrito chain.  i was here last night and the place was pretty busy.  the decor is totally tacky, but in a fun way.  it's a relatively small restaurant with a really big bar.  there's also outdoor seating, which is great for people watching in the strip.  the service was friendly and prompt without being intrusive.  the bathrooms are a little out of the way in the basement, but nevertheless nice and much nicer than i remember them years ago.  we started with a selection of appetizers.  the black bean dip with cheese was pretty good and is the same stuff you get at mad mex.  the scallopp app' was awesome, three huge scallops perfectly cooked with a nice sauce.  i got the "pork belly".  i've had this in other places and it was different than this.  this was basically a really fatty barbecued rib, but i like ribs,so i was happpy enough.  my entree' was the flank steak, which was a nice portion but a little undercooked and the black bean side was cold.  overall an average entree'.  my friend ordered the shrimp with curry vegetables, which she liked a lot and had plenty of leftovers.  i tried the shrimp and they were cooked well and very fresh.  the curry veggies were super hot.  i was a bit disappointed in the wine list having asked for two of the wines on the menu only to find out that they were out of stock.  this is a good spot, but i wouldn't really consider it caribbean or west indian food.  i'm from the carribbean, so maybe i have too high standards.  i'd say this is to carribean food what olive garden is to italian food.

Vmaybe my expectations were a little high, but i left kaya a bit disappointed.  i'm sure the gloomy, slushy weather didn't help, but the restaurant seemed a bit too dim.  the decor was fine, the music was pretty good, and our server was very friendly.\u000a\u000athe food was just a little mediocre.  we started with the mango & tomatillo salsa - very chunky and not bad at all, but the kaya chips were a bit dry and some tasted a little burnt.  as my entree, i chose one of the todo en uno options - a smaller sandwich + 2 sides - with the pressed manchego and idiazabel sandwich, and the spicy slaw and the sweet potato fries as my sides.  the bread for the sandwich was a bit dry, the cheeses were a bit bland, there was a bit too much arugula and the plantain chips on the sandwich had no plantain-y flavor.  the slaw was also very dry and the only spice i tasted was pepper.  the sweet potato fries were very good though.  boyfriend had the pressed serrano ham & manchego sandwich, which he also said was a bit bland.  we shared the creme brulee for dessert, which was not bad.  the bill came to about $36 before tip.\u000a\u000aas we were eating dessert, we heard a couple at the next table rave about the kaya burger, so i may have to try that next time.  i'm also curious about their vegetarian prix fixe dinners - an amuse bouche, 3 courses, and dessert for $39 with plenty of vegan options.  they also have a chocolate & rum valentine's dinner coming up.\u000a\u000aoverall - not very impressed the first time, but willing to come back and try something else.

Vi had eaten here two years ago, and remember it being really good.  i sat at the bar, the bartender was spot-on, and the food was excellent.\u000a\u000awent back this last weekend, and was underwhelmed.  the staff was friendly, helpful, and on-point, which was very much noticed and appreciated.  but the food itself seemed to really lack.\u000a\u000ai had the jamaican curry bowl, which is the last item on the vegetarian menu.  it tasted overspiced; not too spicy, but just as if someone had put in three times the spices the dish called for.  i can't imagine the chef who made this tasted it and liked it.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend got the salmon, which was a really good-sized portion, but it could probably have been fresher.  we split an appetizer that was pretty good, and each had one drink.\u000a\u000athe music was great, actually.  there's a wall of speakers above the front row of tables, but it's turned to a background volume, which led to the music being clear, well balanced, and unobtrusive.  the decor was good, and i especially liked the custom trussing of lights over the bar.  \u000a\u000aanyways, after tax and tip, the entrees should have wowed the hell out of me, and they really failed to do so.  i had wanted to go try the vegetarian prix fixe, but i'll probably hold off on that for awhile.  i'll eventually head back, as i do remember having a great meal there, but at $85 for the two entrees, two drinks, and an appetizer, i'm not in a hurry to check it out again.

Vi have now been to kaya twice, once for dinner and once for brunch and both occasions the food has been lackluster at best. \u000a\u000akaya is attempting to pull off a high concept fusion style restaurant, blending caribbean, south american, pacific and mexican cuisine into an appetizing blend of food. to be perfectly honest i am skeptical of fusion places due to the high rate of failures in execution. in many cases you have a young hot-shot chef who wants to be known as a bold flavor innovator, blending cuisines that he has never mastered to achieve usually poor to mediocre results. the dishes in many cases have only a vague similarity to the original and if it would be beneficial if the chef would stick to concentrating on the basics instead of cooking up bizarre fusion dishes.\u000a\u000asome examples would be the jamaican jerk chicken wings - which tasted nothing like jerk seasoning should (loaded with allspice, heat of the scotch bonnet pepper, cinnamon, cloves, etc. instead it looked like we had a dab of commercially bought jerk seasoning tossed on the wings after cooking. the wings themselves were cooked nicely, big and juicy but still had some pin feathers attached that were not removed, attention to details such as this is mandatory. \u000a\u000afor brunch i tried the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, the eggs were poached hard, again another detail that is unacceptable and sloppy. the salmon was cheap, the cornbread it was served on was good and made for an interesting combination but the addition of smoked paprika on top was okay, but nothing exciting. \u000a\u000ai could go on and on, but you see the problems.\u000a\u000a2.5 stars because the place is interesting for pittsburgh but for those of us who have traveled and eaten in the caribbean, south america and mexico, the food comes off as dull copies of vibrant originals.

V3.5 stars.  i've had the kaya burger in the past as well as brunch yesterday.  kaya focuses on an "island" theme to their food and is located in the strip district at the corner of 20th and smallman st.\u000a\u000abrunch on sunday starts at 11 am.  my companion and i decided to sit outdoors since it was a rare beautiful day of mid-november in pittsburgh.  we started out with their smoked salmon appetizer and their jamaican jerk chicken wings.  for entrees i got the kaya benedict.\u000a\u000ai ordered the smoked salmon b/c i like beginning my meals with some sort of cured meat, either a smoked salmon or some sort of antipasto.  the smoked salmon appetizer came out with a large serving of smoked salmon topped with minced onion, cilantro, a drizzle of creme fraiche and two fresh tortillas from reyna's foods right down the street.  we added the jamaican jerk chicken wings and it was definitely a good decision.  typically chicken wings are fried and then tossed in a sauce.  these wings were super flavorful and crispy; i think they were marinated and then baked?  i'll ask next time i'm there.  the lime cilantro sauce was creamy and full of cilantro, but i would have liked a bit more lime for a little more zing.\u000a\u000athe kaya benedict didn't meet my expectations at all.  it was cornbread with roast pork topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  the cornbread was sweet but it just didn't fit into the dish at all and clashed with the roast pork and the egg.  it's texture was soft and made the entire entree mushy...  the roast pork too... completely uninspiring.  it came with grilled pineapple, which was pretty good as well as their house hash brown, which was a plated as a weird mound with slight crustiness on the outside and mainly mush inside.  the spices of it just didn't click with me.\u000a\u000athe kaya burger though, is one of kaya's saving graces (along with their happy hour).  i ordered it medium rare and it came topped with bacon, avacado, tomato, cheese, special sauce, and a sunny side up egg.  it comes with a side of chips, but you can substitute their side salad if you want.  gourmet burgers are always interesting because the chef's choice in combination of toppings and the bun shows a representation of his/her cooking style.  as someone who views himself as a burger purist, i'm not too familiar with gourmet burgers in general, but the kaya burger did impress me.\u000a\u000ai'd probably just stick munching on some appetizers with drinks during their weekday happy hour from 5-7 pm.

Vwell, we went back again, with a friend who hadn't been to kaya in a few years.  we accidentally hit a happy hour we didn't know about, and had a half hour wait for a table; no problems.  the bartenders basically ignored us for fifteen minutes while we sat there - seated at the bar - and that kind of soured the tone.\u000a\u000athe portion sizes were opulent, and most of the food was excellent.  but one of the appetizers was just straight up burned; it'd be hard to respect the food you're serving *and* let that out of the kitchen.  \u000a\u000aa-ok, since it averaged between excellent and terrible.

Vmy boyfriend and i went to kaya on one of the first ridiculously, awfully hot days in june.  it was our three-year anniversary (of dating).  i would've loved to sit outside, but their tables weren't shaded and even in the early evening, it would've been too hot to sit along the sidewalk.  so inside we went.\u000a\u000athe decor was really cool, and comfortable.  the caribbean vibe flows throughout the restaurant with the music, the lights, the shape of the chairs, the bar - like a classy tiki lounge?  you'll feel like you're on vacation.\u000a\u000aour server was great - i can't remember his name, unfortunately, but he wore glasses and i think he had a ponytail.  he was friendly and casual, quick with a joke and a recommendation.  we started a carafe of rum runners - a carafe will get you three drinks for the price of two, so do it - and the drinks were delicious.  the rum runner has two kinds of rum, blackberry brandy, banana liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine - it tasted and looked just as good as it sounds.  and we were still able to drive afterward.\u000a\u000afor the meal, we began with the jamaican jerk wings with cilantro cream sauce, and they were fan-tas-tic.  some of the best wings i've had anywhere, ever.  they are spicy, and the skin is crispy, and they were just luscious.  the cilantro cream sauce provided the perfect balance.  i'd order this again anytime.\u000a\u000awe then split the tropical paella - they split the entree onto two plates for us - and it was quite good as well.  less stunning than the wings, less creative perhaps, but well executed, tasty, and satisfying nonetheless.  the seafood in the paella was well-cooked, and the taste of the pineapple was outstanding.\u000a\u000awe were still a tiny bit hungry, so we got calamari instead of dessert.  the calamari came with jicama, radicchio, coconut, and peanuts, in a sesame-banana vinaigrette.  the flavors were undeniably tropical, the calamari was crispy, and we picked at it long after we were full, just to get one more sweet, crunchy bite.\u000a\u000athere are some pricey options here, and some very moderately priced items.  they also have happy hour on weekdays, so i think you could easily eat here without breaking the bank.  i'd call this an easy 4 star review....edging toward 4 1/2....i bet they could break the 5 star barrier if we had one more great dinner here!

Vsince big burrito was kind enough to send me a gift card in the mail for mah birthday, my boyfriend insisted that we go out to dinner for my birthday...again....yes, this was my third birthday dinner in the period of one week.  hey, you only turn 27 once!\u000a\u000ai decided we should go on a thursday, because that was fried chicken night and i don't even need to say why that sounds insanely awesome.  i didn't even end up ordering the fried chicken, but i made my boyfriend get it so i could try it.  birthday girl gets to make decision!  we didn't make reservations, just showed up around 7 pm or so.  they were pretty busy and we thought we'd have to wait awhile, but by the time we ordered drinks at the bar, our table was ready.\u000a\u000awe both ordered delicious cocktails - one was a grapefruit-basil margarita, and i forgot what the other one was.  that's what i get for being a bad yelper and not posting for a few weeks.  since it wasn't quite 7 pm yet, our drinks were half off, making any cocktail suddenly an amazing bargain.  definitely a good reason to come to kaya early!  \u000a\u000aour server was friendly, and he recommend the barramundi in chile broth.  i sprung for it, since it was an expensive entree and i wanted to get my gift card's worth.  my boyfriend got the fried chicken, at my insistence.  let me say that my barramundi was outstanding.  way better than i expected.  fresh, flavorful, and just marvelous all around.  totally worth the money, but if you have a gift card then it's a don't-miss!  i was so happy that i didn't even really want to share my boyfriend's chicken, but i took a few bites.  it was incredibly crispy, which i loved, but honestly it wasn't as flavorful as i hoped.  more salt in the breading needed, perhaps?  chicken was very juicy though - just didn't deliver a flavor punch.  it was served with a salsa of some sort, so perhaps that was meant to compensate, but i hoped for more kick.\u000a\u000ai wouldn't get the chicken again, but i'd go back in a heartbeat for that barramundi and another half-price cocktail!  mmmmmm.

Vkaya is on my "top 5" list in pittsburgh for sure.  anything i have ever had here has been wonderful.  my absolute favorite thing here is the fried tofu plate that they have on fried chicken nights now--it's hard to make something like tofu taste this amazing!  (and probably totally unhealthy as well).  \u000a\u000ai also like the kaya veggie burger, the black bean dip, any fish i've ever eaten here, and don't even get me started on the cocktail menu...it's so hard to decide!  even if you don't think you like caribbean food or spicy things, give it a shot.  there's something for everyone and i will come back until i've tried everything, and probably more times after that!  it's wonderful!!

Vmy husband and i absolutely love wholey's!  now i must warn you that before you come here, be prepared for the smell.  although the place is clean, it does have that strong fish smell.   well, what do you expect?  it's a fish market!  but i absolutely love shrimp, and they have the best!  my other seafood weakness is salmon.  i've never had a bad salmon from here.  they've always been tender and flavorful.\u000a\u000aas others have noted, you can get other meat and produce here too.  the meat here is pretty good--a cut (no pun intended) above average.  rick really likes the pork chops from here.  i prefer to get my produce from other places in the strip, but if i'm in a hurry, wholey's is pretty good, if a little unspectacular.

Vfoodie paradise!!!\u000a\u000awe had so much fun shopping here, i swear we stayed nearly an hour.  i had no idea how big the store was!  first i thought it was just seafood, then i saw meat, then i saw fancy groceries and produce - it's everything you need!  and it's (mostly) well-priced!\u000a\u000asome items seemed a bit overpriced, but most were very reasonable.  we got some lovely salmon for only $6 a pound.  i think it was "salmon tail" so maybe that's a cheaper cut, but it tasted lovely and fresh.  we also got very inexpensive and huuuuuge chicken breasts.  these things were massive!  you wouldn't think that it mattered where you get boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but you can tell there was something special about these.  they were just...plumper.  and they smelled fresh and looked gorgeous.\u000a\u000awe also got a pound of also very inexpensive housemade hot italian sausage that was soooo yummy!  made it tonight with rigatoni in tomato vodka sauce.  it would be a wonderful accompaniment to any meal.\u000a\u000awe've only been in the strip district once, but we'll definitely be back to visit wholey's again!

Vi, for one, doubt i will ever return here.  the smell of the place almost made me sick to my stomach and i almost did a 180 and walked back out the door.  yes people, i know this is primarily a fish market, but i cannot put myself through that again.  i did make it through the whole store, but because of the overwhelming smell, i did not purchase anything.\u000a\u000ain fact i ended up being like a little kid in here standing at the tanks in the back staring at the fish and lobsters.  i also marveled at the train that literally scared the crap out of me when i first realized it was there.  \u000a\u000ahonestly i do not know if the prices here are better than other places as i was not too keen on looking, therefore i did not notice the prices.\u000a\u000ai also did not venture to purchase one of their "famous" fish sandwiches...i don't think i could stomach it.

Vanother restaurant on my list of "yeah, it was good, i guess," places in pittsburgh.  they make a really big deal on their menu about their huge portions and prices that haven't changed in many years despite them having to pay more for food.  i kind of felt like they were pandering for my sympathies, and maybe i would say, "no!  charge  me more, union grill!"  i ordered a $4 pint of yuengling, which seemed high to me. since their menu said they have really big portions, i ordered the $11 chicken pot pie which didn't come with anything else.  it was bland, the potatoes and carrots were a little too al dente, and i easily finished the portion.  granted, i was full, but with a disclaimer of big portions, i was hoping to have some to take home for dinner.  so, it wasn't insanely good, wasn't really bad.  i will go again to try out the burgers.

Vthe union grill served me the worst fish tacos i've ever had in my life (complete with rotting avocados)! i've only been here twice, but was not particularly impressed either time with the food or the service. this place will do in a pinch, but it is nothing special.

Vi walk by here on the way to work, and spied some amazing looking humus, waffle fries, and burgers sitting on tables on the patio more than once, so i decided to take my mom and sister when they visited.  stupidly, i ordered a salad, which was only "fine."  so think of this review as actually more like ***?, with extra stars potentially reserved for when i go back and order the dishes that looked good enough to lure me in there to begin with.

Vwent here on a working lunch and had the crab cake sandwich. in hindsight, i should've tried the fish sandwich, which they claim can't be eaten by one person alone. the food was fine, though, and it was relatively inexpensive. decent lunch place.

Vi met a friend here for lunch on a thursday at noon.  though there were plenty of tables when i first arrived, it started to fill up quickly - clearly a hoppin' lunch spot!  \u000a\u000asince i had a few minutes to myself before my friend arrived, i looked over the menu and i was really impressed with what i'll call their "attitude" toward serving alcohol.  they are apparently famous for their $10 wine list, and it says on the menu that they believe people shouldn't have to pay a premium to enjoy wine with their food, so they serve wine/beer basically at cost.  and all drinks are half-off every single day from 6-9pm.  all that made me wish i was there for dinner so it would be appropriate to have a drink!\u000a\u000ainstead, alas, it was just lunch, so i stuck with water - served in a ginormous glass so nobody needed to refill me.  i ordered the tuna melt with swiss cheese and waffle fries.  the sandwich was pretty huge - i could only eat half of it before i was full.  i thought it was very tasty, and i know a tuna melt isn't always the most appetizing thing when done improperly, but i liked their spin on it.  the cheese was melted and yummy.  it was a bit awkward to eat, being so big, the filling had a hard time staying contained in the bread.  the fries were a nice accompaniment as well.\u000a\u000ait took us forever to signal to our waiter for the check, which is not normally a big deal, but at lunch on a weekday people usually want to get in and out within an hour, so perhaps he could have been a bit more attentive.\u000a\u000ai have the feeling that if i return for dinner to take advantage of the drink specials, and the food is still as good or better, i'll be adding a four-star review!

Va welcome departure from your typical oakland eateries, the union grill is a quaint sit down restaurant with an admirable selection of food and libation. j is obsessed with their burgers, "they do medium rare just perfectly, every time" he says. but i wouldn't know anything about that, i'll stick to the hummus extravaganza which can be shared but i usually get it with as a meal or i'll opt for the 6 grain veggie melt which is a roasted veg sammie on locally made 6 grain bread. service has always been reliable and the prices are unbeatable.\u000a\u000ap.s. they no longer offer the "shoe string" potatoes, i'm sure a lot of people may be pleased to hear that.

Va delicious burger made of turkey...check.\u000aa swank looking place on the inside that is somewhat hidden from the outside...check.\u000aa staff all dressed alike that distinguishes them from the guests...check.\u000a\u000aall in all, i would say this place nailed it.  from the look of the inside to the friendliness of the staff.  granted i did not dine in house, but i was able to scope out the place.\u000a\u000aupon arriving after i placed my order i walked in and was greeted warmly by the hostess who informed me that my order would be ready at the bar.  it was so very tempting standing by the bar and not ordering a drink.  but being that i was at work and on my lunch, i could not imbibe.  from the looks of the drinks that nearby patrons had, i may have to come this way for a nightcap.  once the bartender was finished making up the drink she was in the process of perfecting, she was onto me.  swiftly she grabbed my bag, rang up my bill and swiped my card.  after that i was out the door.\u000a\u000aonce i was able to eye my food, i was not disappointed.  the turkey patty was enormous.  to say that it was flavorful would be an understatement.  the cooked it perfectly and somehow had this delicious crispiness surrounding the outside of the patty.  the bread was fresh, very fresh and slightly toasted.  i opted for their in house made mustard sauce and was that ever pleasing.  creamy and with the best combination of spices made it compliment everything else that was on the patty.  no need to worry either if it will overpower the whole burger as everything melded together in my mouth.  that, my friends, is how you do a turkey burger.\u000a\u000aalong with the burger came a pickle spear and a side of waffle cut fries.  both good, but not as amazing as the burger itself.  i will definitely be back to get another turkey burger from here, and hopefully this time i will be able to sit and enjoy the atmosphere on the inside as well.

Vpros:\u000a- they deliver through campusfood.\u000a- their vegetarian sushi is well-made, tastes good, and is pretty cheap.  $3 for avocado or kappa rolls, $4 for avocado + kappa or shiitake mushroom rolls.\u000a- vegetables tempura were pretty decent, once you overlook the inherent sogginess that comes along with delivered fried foods.\u000a\u000acons:\u000a- the spicy chicken was not particularly spicy, and was actually pretty bland.\u000a- egg rolls are not very good.  i would skip them the next time i order.\u000a- they offer asparagus rolls at their location at cmu, but not on the online menu, which specifically asks you not to make substitutions.  the campus sushi place is closed until fall semester, which means i have to go without asparagus rolls all summer.\u000a\u000athe entrees don't seem too great, and i can't speak to the fish, but if you're a vegetarian and like sushi, then i can definitely recommend sushi too.

Vi came across sushi too as i was searching for a dinner place. the set up and service was nothing fantastic but it still worked. a few tables and booths scattered inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000athe portions were pretty large. i ordered a seaweed salad and a huge bowl of it came. i rolled out of the restaurant after having 2 special rolls and a bottle from their selection of beers. there were a number of regular and special rolls, deluxe platters, different appetizers, and cooked entrees.

Vcame here on a wednesday evening for some sushi with the girls!  i had just exercised and was looking forward to a nice, light meal.  the place was a little busy - not full, but several tables occupied - but we were seated immediately.  atmosphere and service both were functional but not personal, nothing special there - except the hammerhead shark that hangs above the sushi bar.\u000a\u000ai got the rainbow roll and an eel roll, with soup and salad first.  miso is $2, so is house salad.  i prefer it when that comes complementary, but i decided to pay for it since it just feels wrong for me to have sushi without.  miso was good, hot and filled with tofu.  the house salad was about two or three times larger than it usually is, and the dressing was a little heavier than i like it.  i was a little bummed since i started feeling full of salad before my sushi even arrived!  \u000a\u000athe rainbow roll was small.  usually i have rainbow rolls with about 8-10 pieces (i think?) but this one only had 6.  it was also about the same size as the eel roll (standard 6 pieces).  i don't think the rainbow roll was a good deal for the price.  all the sushi was okay, it didn't taste uber-fresh but it wasn't bad either.  not as flavorful as i'd hoped.  it was well-made, but the presentation completely lacked any flair.\u000a\u000ait's a pretty inexpensive place to grab a few rolls, which is nice.  i paid $20 for soup (2), salad (2), one specialty roll (10?!?!), and one regular roll (6).  rainbow roll was not worth $10, so i'd say stick with the simple rolls that make more sense with the price.  it satisfied a craving, but i've had way better sushi elsewhere.

Vthis is one of the few places i try to make a point of visiting every time i'm visiting my parents.  it was one of my favorite haunts in high school and continues to rank high on my list of favorite restaurants.  the service is always great, i've never had to wait for a table, and i love the food.\u000a\u000aabout five years ago, my favorite appetizer here was the rice rolls, spring rolls stuffed with rice and shredded carrots instead of the standard cabbage mixture.  i'm still hoping they'll make an appearance again someday.  until then, i love the fresh spring rolls.  the sauce is sweet but not too much so, and i like starting off what is bound to be an enormous meal with something light.  i also recommend starting your meal off with a thai iced tea.\u000a\u000ai believe i've had every vegetarian entree except for a few that contain peanut sauce, and i enjoy them all.  the woon sen pad thai is a good twist on the standard, but the curries really stand out in my mind.  they are all delicious and different..  the thai place also offers a few desserts - fried ice cream and mangoes with sticky rice amongst them.\u000a\u000aoverall, i think this is a gem and definitely worth visiting.  as a vegetarian with food allergies (probably a chef's nightmare), i really appreciate the service, the care, and the fact that i have never in six years had to send an entree back or even look twice before i dig in.\u000a\u000aps: if you are a crappy parallel parker like i am, park in the garage on bellefonte and walk over.  it is always cheap and gives you a chance to burn off a few extra calories during the walk.

Vi just moved back to pittsburgh and decided to take my boyfriend to the thai place for a celebratory dinner.  the good news was that on a wednesday evening around 7:30, it was nearly empty and our food came out very promptly; we weren't even finished with our spring rolls when the entrees came out.\u000a\u000athe bad news is that prices have gone up, portion sizes have gone down, and the food was pretty bland.  my boyfriend rated his pad thai lower than some "fast-food" asian places', and my curry with a spice level of 7 was so tame, it wouldn't have bothered an infant.\u000a\u000ai'm not sure if this place was better 6 years ago, or if i just had lower standards because i hadn't tried thai food anywhere else and i was a high school student without years of trying restaurants under my belt.  at any rate, i will be on the lookout for a better thai restaurant and would only go here if desperate.

Vmeh.  the food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  i'll agree that the curry puffs were pretty good, but they were more indian than thai.  we started with some spring rolls, which were fine, but not being a spring roll person, i let my friend eat most of them.  \u000a\u000awe then got the curry puffs, fried tofu, and the panang curry.  i was not particularly fond of their fried tofu - it was perfectly crispy, but somehow totally bland, even with the sauce that was provided.  the panang curry was fine too, but again, nothing spectacular.\u000a\u000atotally reasonable place.  the service is nice, but the prices seem kind of high for what it is.  i don't think i would go out of my way to come here again.

Vgood, but not exceptional. \u000a\u000aif you like it spicy on a scale of 1-10, order an 11. \u000a\u000ai've been there a couple times and the pad thai and tom kha soup are the only note worthy dishes i have experienced. it is a bit pricey for the small portions. if it was an extraordinary dish i wouldn't mind the prices, unfortunately that's not the case.

Vi've eaten at thai place for lunch on several different occasions. the food is very good, and the lunch menu is a bargain. for less tan $10, you get soup, spring rolls, and a generous lunch portion. the only thing to keep in mind is that (like most of the other reviewers have noted) the food is not very spicy.

Vhaving lamented the lack of solid mexican food in pittsburgh, i was pleased to find fajita grill.  though they don't satisfy my californian craving for mexican street food, as one other reviewer put it, this is pretty solid higher quality mexican fare.  \u000a\u000adinner started off with salsa with chips, which were good.  i personally didn't think they tasted as though they came out of a bag, although they were cold.  i just took it to mean that they had been made earlier, which is fine.  we actually liked the salsa quite a bit.\u000a\u000amy husband had the black bean soup, which he liked.  i tried their tortilla soup, which was solid (but a bit small, for my taste).  would have liked it with some sour cream too, but they served it with some cheese, which was nice.\u000a\u000ahighlight of the evening was my main entree, the garlic shrimp (al ajillo).  it comes with a salad, which basically consists of lettuce, some bell peppers and carrots, doused with spicy dressing.  it was a little too spicy for me, but i appreciated that the entree came with it.  the shrimps were absolutely fantastic - perfectly cooked, lots of garlic and just the right amount of spice.  combined with the seasoned rice with beans, and i couldn't stop eating it.\u000a\u000awill definitely go back again.  try this place not for the usual mexican stuff, like tacos or burritos, but go for the big ticket specials.  yeah, it's a bit pricier, but i'm guessing that's where this place shines.

Vi'm *horrible* and horribly uninformed about hair styling, maintenance, and general hair upkeep.   in fact, a haircut for me is generally motivated by the desire to remove split ends and not much else!  cha cha (robyn woo!) took my hair naivety and turned it into the perfect cut for my cheek bones without losing any length.  though i didn't have much to say in terms of my desired look, robyn certainly took into consideration my indifference when it comes to styling and the necessity of a low maintenance style.  loved it and have since received numerous compliments!  \u000a\u000aadded bonus is the awesome space, good music, and nice selection of products.  make an appointment (though they saw me super last minute)!

Von the rare occasions when i go back to champaign, there are a few places i always need to revisit - the first, obviously, is dos reales.  the second is papa del's.  everybody seems to love papa del's, and for good reason.  champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but papa del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness.  there's usually a line, but even on friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes!  and they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived.  the beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot.  i'm not a pizza snob by any means - all i know is when i cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....i'm a happy girl.  see you next homecoming!

Vi can't bring myself to give gumby's four stars for the pokey stix.  ask me when i'm drunk, and i'll say they're the greatest things i've ever eaten.  but sitting here now, i can't reasonably give them more than four stars.  greasy, cheesy, salty, bready goodness.  i don't think their pizza is that exciting....but who gets pizza here?  2 am pokey stix are the thing.  we just got them again over homecoming last weekend, and they were just as satisfying as i remembered.  i wonder how many hangovers they have prevented?  all that bread in your stomach - you'd think it would make you sick, but i swear it prevents sickness (of the drunken variety).

Vupdate:  i recently had the worst service i have ever had at a bar at boltini.  i have never been as insulted by a waiter in my life as i was last night, when our waiter threw our checks at us and then went to the trouble of getting cash out of the register to return our tip, also throwing it at us, even though we paid with credit card.  not only was this guy completely out of line, when i began reciting this story to friends later in the night "we almost got in a fight with our waiter..." everyone i told it to knew which waiter i was talking about from previous experience.  i won't be going back to boltini for a while, and it gets demoted to 2 stars.  that kind of treatment is unacceptable.\u000a\u000ai think boltini is my favorite bar in cu since it is essentially the only one that does not pander to illini sports and skeezy undergrad men trying to get 18 year old sorority girls drunk, but it's hard to get my friends to go there because they think this makes it "pretentious" and "snobby," preferring to get barfed upon at mike and molly's or wherever.  \u000a\u000apersonally i do not think it is pretentious, and i tend to think that the staff are only snobby when the patrons are acting like they are at a kegger and not like normal human beings trying to enjoy a non-keystone beverage.  notably, when i first visited boltini on a grad school visit whilei was living in boston, i was shocked at how cheap the drinks were.  i did not expect such low prices from such a well-appointed bar.\u000a\u000ai would expect boltini to have the best cocktails of any place downtown but i think that award , bizzarely, goes instead to guido's.  the other factor contributing to the four star rating is the terrible, omnipresent, cigar-doused in ammonia smell that is even detectable out on the patio.  perhaps this will improve when champaign becomes smoke-free.

Vwow - these guys used to be good. i saw them on broadway 20 years ago and they were very entertaining. the magic was great and the show flowed and kept you on the edge of your seat. not anymore.\u000a\u000ai honestly can't believe the reviews here, i got bored during the show, yup bored to the point i started texting people and writing a to-do list.\u000a\u000athe easiest way to describe their act is a one large arrogant loudmouth who thinks he knows more and is better then all of you. he then goes to explain that he knows more and is better then you and the people applaud and tell him he is so smart and better then them. huh, i just didn't get it. the magic was lame at best, their comedy was lacking and the whole show was banal.\u000a\u000ai remember laughing my a$$ off in ny, being bamboozled by some of their tricks but now they seem like they don't care, they have a permanent show and making the big bucks so who cares what the fans think.\u000a\u000awhat a huge disappointment.\u000a\u000a2 stars because they used to be great.

Vour school treated us to a dinner here to celebrate the end of semester. it was a great choice and we had so much food! the service was quick (dinner on thurs, with 20+ people) , sangria, wine, and bread were at the table before we even sat down. then the appetizers started coming out, my favorites were garlic shrimp and spanish sausage. the green pepper one was ok but a good choice for vegetarians. \u000a\u000athen came the main course accompanied a house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. we had some choices: pasta, fish, steak, veggie + sides of saffron rice and chips. i went with the steak, it was huge and topped with cheese and mushrooms. i got it medium-rare, it was nice and juicy, maybe the fat could've been trimmed some more.\u000a\u000afor dessert, i had rum cake and coffee and some odd tasting sweet liquor. they have valet parking and a small parking lot next to the restaurant, pretty convenient. great restaurant overall, i'm curious to try the paella to see how it compares to sf

Vupon entering the dining area, my first impression was not overly positive. the room was crowded, and the tables were too close together; this created a hectic atmosphere which was not very pleasant for dinner. most people were wearing fairly fancy clothing up to and including full suits.\u000a\u000athe waiter tried to push drinks on us fairly heavily and then proceeded to go over the ridiculously long list of "daily specials." i've never heard a specials list as long as the one here - it must have taken the waiter at least a half an hour to memorize it. note that i don't view this as a positive aspect - while it's great to have specials, having this many is a sign that something is amiss. we decided to just go for the menu.\u000a\u000athe bread they provided as an appetizer was excellent, although strangely the butter was served in little packets rather than just in a butter dish. the appetizer salads which came as part of the entres were basically inedible because they drenched them with so much salad dressing. i got the mixed seafood in green sauce, and while it was decent, i felt that the sauce was too salty and overpowering. my dinner partner's dish was similarly salty and not too exciting. the mixed vegetables which came out were also overdone, and too drenched in some sort of sauce.\u000a\u000aoverall, the best part of the meal was the bread which is kind of sad. the other food wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't very good. my overall impression of the place was that they were trying just a little too hard, but not quite making it. certainly for the price, i don't think it's worth it.

Vi really like this place, sure it's busy and you'll have to wait for a table but it's totally worth it.  i first visited this place about a decade ago when it was a much smaller place and not as well known, but they've always paid special attention to the food and beer selection.  i was here yesterday with a larger group of friends and we had a blast.  we didn't have a reservation and there was about 8 of us, so the wait was about 45 minutes.  great excuse to have a few belgian beers prior to lunch.  we ordered some fries with bacon and cheese and also some fried mushrooms as appetizers, greasy goodness!!  the server was really good, she definitely knew what she was talking about with respect to beer selection and was very generous in offering samples of different delicious beers.  she was friendly, knowledgeable and then had a beer with us after her shift was over.  the wings are a must have when you visit.  my favorite item on the menu is the chargrilled wings which are delicious.  they are baked and then grilled, so they are not greasy at all and are actually probably relatively healthy for you... relatively...  the garlic parm wings are also great and i suggest you definitely try these as well.  i also ordered the steak and egg "headwich" which is  definitely as big as my head.  it was enough for three of us to share along with the wings.  and, to top it all off as if 6 belgian beers, wings, steaks, and eggs weren't enough we also tried one of the desserts (cheesecake) which was a little better than average.  overall, this place has one of the best beer selections in town and probably the best bar food in the burgh'.  it's a must visit when you are in the city.

Vloved it!  the other reviewers aren't kidding about the menu, it's like a litany to food and it takes some time to figure out what item on it makes you drool the most.  i had the renee burger:  american cheese, bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and cheddar cheese sauce, with fries.  it was a plate of food that i could never even hope finish, every bite delicious.  bonus, even though it was like 1130am when i ate there, when i asked our waitress if i could have a shot of absolut citron, she didn't even blink before exclaiming "absolutely!"  i'll definitely go back (when i'm hungrier!)

Vamazing beer selection! sadly, that's about all this place has going for it. the food is mediocre at best and the place is crawling with douchey dude-bros. if you're into d-bags and crowds then this is the place for you, as for me i would rather buy a case of arrogant bastard and sit on my porch swillin.

Vone of pittsburgh's must visit bars. fatheads is almost always busy with a 30-60ish minute wait for a table every friday + saturday night. with that statistic, you'd think this was some kind of fancy, trendy restaurant. but, it's really not, it's a bar. a bar with a great beer selection, including their own brews, and a really delicious menu. this just goes to show that some of the best, most popular places don't have to be fancy or have a trendy foodie following. it just has to be damn good. \u000a\u000ai'm a fan of their killer sauce hot wings. it makes me salivate just thinking about them. they have a huge selection of sandwiches, both heart-attack style and healthier. the big famous sandwich is the southside slope piled with kielbasa, pierogies, and toppings. but, since i am not (or try not to be) that much of a glutton, i'd go with the meatless millie, their pierogies sandwich with sauerkraut.\u000a\u000a**i interrupt this review with a public service announcement** \u000a\u000ayou can not check out the pittsburgh food scene without eating pierogies. what are they? don't ask, just order. places to get good pierogies: fatheads (duh.), bloomfield bridge tavern (bbt), church brew works, some polish grandma's kitchen. \u000a\u000a**now back to your regular programming**\u000a\u000awith a good selection of salads to choose from, even your healthy eating friends will enjoy fatheads. but the real question is: why do you have healthy eating friends? and why would you go out to eat with them? \u000a\u000aoh, and last but definitely not least, the beer. that you'll have to experience for yourself.

Vfour stars because this place is an institution.  not just fries, but a bag of fries.  be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don't know.  the pizzas also aren't bad, especially for the price, but late at night, be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food.  \u000a\u000aoh, the store is not the best place to actually eat you food, but just take it home and start that second party.

Vevery large university area i have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. in this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.\u000a\u000aok i know this place is an iconic pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. first of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. lame.\u000a\u000asecond complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. it's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctly\u000a\u000athird complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? you have two main components: the dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.\u000a\u000afourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. you would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.\u000a\u000afifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and i'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.\u000a\u000afood 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did it\u000aservice 1.5 stars - i think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.\u000avalue 1 star, ok i have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.\u000a\u000atotal: 1.33 stars\u000a\u000afor hot dogs in pa both the frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while wiener world (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns.

Vhuge portions, dirt cheap prices. the french fries are amazing, however the cheese is gross, let it sit too long and it turns into a gelatinous mess. the pizza appears to be a frozen pie thrown into an oven and heated. \u000a\u000ait's a good place for cheap eats and a cold beer, that's about it. the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired and if you go by the saying "the kitchen is as clean as the bathroom" the under no circumstances should you enter the loo.

Vi know i'm supposed to like the o and that it's a tradition, but honestly, the food is not all that good.  i like the fries, they are better than average, and the portions are huge.  my cheesesteak sandwich was not even average, and the portion of meat was very skimpy.

Vthere's something about a hot dog that can make any person's day better.  does that sound corny, heck if i care.\u000a\u000athe o is one of those pittsburgh things, one part mythical and one part mandatory.  it is one of those places that any and all pittsburgher should try at least once before moving on.  believe it or not, this is only my second time trying this place and i've lived and worked in the burgh for over ten years now.  people are always complaining about how this place has a negative appeal, i just don't see it.  you may have some bad things happen here, but that can happen at any business in any part of the city.\u000a\u000athe hot dogs them self are amazing.  so many different ways to have them topped.  and, they are cooked fresh right in front of you.  they are first cooked on the griddle and then right before they toss them in the bun to be topped to your liking, they put them on a grill to give them that char mark and a little bit of crispiness.  biting into one of these masterpieces is close to heaven.  once you bite through that casing, it's like full flavor in your mouth.  my latest visit i just opted for the boring (yet tasty) ketchup, mustard and onion on my dog.  i'm happy i opted for it this way.  the flavor combination above did not over power the dog.\u000a\u000ai also got some of their fresh cut fries, a small, not that colossal fry that i knew i'd be eating for three days and they were just as good.  a note to people, they ask if you want salt on them instead of just putting it on there.  so for all those health conscious, low sodium eaters out there, that solves it for you.\u000a\u000aa few other notes on this place.  they accept credit cards instead of being a cash only establishment.  there is extra seating on other floors.  there is a walk up window for the warmer months.  limited bar experience here as well.  six packs to go.\u000a\u000aenjoy your dog here, or take it to go.  it is truly a one of a kind pittsburgh experience.

Vthis place gets four stars because it is vegan friendly.  a bit pricey, i admit, but try and go for the half-price menu, after 11 pm and if you are a student, sometime during the early afternoon (can't remember the times).  happy hour is always crazy, with half off margaritas and wings.  (get the san fran - yum!)  take note - it's dark and noisy, so don't go here for some intimate talk!

Vmy chickpea chili was good.  i still haven't a burrito or margarita at mad mex, so i don't feel like i've had the whole experience yet.  but my chili was good.

Vthe four reasons why i've never paid full price for anything at mad mex before:\u000a\u000a2-4 pm: half priced entrees w/ student id\u000a4:30-6:30 pm: half priced wings and $7 big azz margaritas\u000a9:00pm -12:00 am: $7 big azz margaritas\u000aafter 11:00 pm: half priced entrees\u000a\u000aanyways, on with the food.  mad mex serves up super americanized tex-mex and they don't pretend to be authentic by any means.  they have burritos, tacos, nachos, salads, wings, you name it.  for me, i go solely for their wings.  a large order of 14 wings ($4.50 when half off) is more than sufficient, and pair that with a $7 big azz margarita and everything is good.  flavor of choice?  san francisco.  all their flavors are good and their wings are some of the better wings i've had in pittsburgh in terms of how well they're cooked.\u000a\u000aif i'm not getting wings, what would i get?  wing-o-rito.  it's a burrito w/ chicken inside that's smothered in wing sauce.  okay, i really like their wings.\u000a\u000atry their double dipper with black bean dip too!  it's super hearty, slightly spicy, and pairs perfectly with a margarita.\u000a\u000aif you go at night, it gets loud.  and the place also fills up fast after 11 pm, so you might have to wait if you don't arrive early.

Vvegetarians are sometimes hard to please, but mad mex really delivers! there are a lot of veggie & vegan options and i've never been disappointed with anything i've ordered. herbivores & carnivores will all be pleased with the extensive menu. they also have a great beer selection and make good & spicy bloody mary's. \u000a\u000ai live very close to the oakland location but cringe when i think about going there, this particular locale is always elbow to elbow with college students and the seating arrangement makes it difficult for the servers to maneuver through the diners. finding a parking spot is also a panic attack inducing experience. luckily, there are branches in monroeville, robinson, and mcknight rd. i usually go to the monroeville location because it's bigger, it seems like they put more love into the dishes, parking is never a problem, and the outdoor seating area is a plus.

Vsee eric l.'s review for best times to go. situated right next to cmu and pitt campuses, mad mex mainly caters to college students with huge and quite strong margaritas and extremely dark ambiance. the waiters even have small flashlights if you can't see the menu!\u000a\u000aso far i've tried a burrito and an enchilada here. the burrito was folded square and is a fork-and-knife kinda burrito. it wasn't exceptionally tasty. the enchilada was better and spicy but again, not mouth-watering. the margaritas and chips and salsa combo are the winners so far.\u000a\u000ai do love the art in here. i don't know if it's a chain thing and it's simply outsourced but i like to believe it's painted by local mural artists.

Vwith a big burrito gift card in tow (yay christmas presents!), we headed over to mad mex on a friday evening, around 6:30 pm.  parking was pretty bad for pittsburgh - we've never been to this part of oakland before and it was just tiny, crowded streets, and students smoking on their porches while discussing drunken escapades.  not the nicest neighborhood.\u000a\u000ainside, it was packed.  we anticipated a long wait, but actually were seated immediately - the noisy crowd wasn't there for dinner, just happy hour and cheap margaritas.  apparently you get a table only if you are really eating a meal, which i have to say i appreciated.  the room was dark and noisy, but the noise level become much more manageable as happy hour ended and the drunk students left.  much improved.\u000a\u000aour server informed us there were only a few minutes left of happy hour, so we managed to squeeze in a quick order of margaritas in order to get the discounted price.  $5 for their medium size (happy hour only) was a pretty good deal.  i had whatever their featured margarita was - frozen, with three different fruit flavors.  it was very tasty, gave me a light buzz, and didn't taste of mix.  would've appreciated more than a "light buzz," if you know what i mean, but for $5 it was a deal.\u000a\u000awe ordered chips and salsa, which are unfortunately not free as they usually are at mexican restaurants, but you did get a few fun salsa choices - we settled on roasted tomato chipotle.  i think it cost $3.  i liked the smoky chipotle flavor - but i still think it ought to be free.  it always seems greedy to me when restaurants charge for things that are traditionally free, like bread, or chips/salsa.  \u000a\u000afor my entree, i got one of the specials, which the server said was a great choice - the jerk pork and fried banana tacos.  i have to admit, they were pretty tasty.  pork was well-seasoned, bananas were delish (but i would've liked more of them!), but holy crap those tacos were hot.  and i love spicy food, truly spicy food.  but this - there were these whole slices of hot peppers.  i bit into one once, and couldn't taste anything for 10 minutes, it felt like my mouth was shaking.  spicy tacos are one thing, but so hot that you can't even enjoy the meal?  i had to pick the peppers out, for my poor tongue's sake.  rice and beans on the side were bland, which would have been annoying but ended up not bothering me given my temporary taco-mouth-death.\u000a\u000ai know my boyfriend liked his chicken chimi, and i get the impression the food here is pretty good, and they do have some cool options.  but this location was so loud and collegey, i'm not sure i'd return.  i'd try a different location though, to seek better ambiance.  but you won't catch me paying for chips and salsa again - stingy ol' mad mex!

Vmad mex, you can do no wrong.  i'm not sure if it's the big azz margaritas or the tofu sour cream that makes me want to cry more.  asides for the wait, i've never had a bad experience here.\u000a\u000ai'm a bit of a picky eater at times, but love this place because they let me mix and match my soft tacos.  usually end up getting one chicken, one steak, one ground beef with all the fixings, albeit variations of the traditional.  i opt for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream.  gotta have me a piece of the blue cornbread as well.  not sure what they do with it, but that ooey-gooey part is what i crave.  i'm sure people look at me and think 'what a pig' because of all the food i have in front of me.  if the shoe fits, i'm a pig.  nothing wrong with chowing down on some of the best mexican food i've ever had the chance to explore.\u000a\u000atwo suggestions for y'all:\u000a\u000a1. opt for your margaritas on the rocks.  the frozen ones do one hell of a job on you when you get brain freeze.\u000a\u000a2.  pay attention to the indicators for the bathroom.  don't be a goof like me and go into the wrong bathroom on multiply occasions....i still don't think i can get that one right.

Vthis mad mex is small, but mighty!  i don't understand the bad reviews--yes, it's a chain, but the food here is really good and the same as all the other locations i've been to.  i work in oakland and if i can take a long lunch, i like to come here.  it's not usually that busy around lunchtime and you can definitely get in and out in less than an hour.  staff is friendly and they have an awesome beer selection in case you're not coming here during the workday like me!

Vjust finished the buffet lunch at star of india. food was decent and servers were pleasant, but nothing special and there weren't very many options in the buffet. for $9.60 it seemed a bit overpriced -  i would recommend tamarind instead.

Vthe food is just average, but what brings me back is the great lunch specials.  if you get the upgrade to the nasi kuning platter, for an extra $1.75 you add on a soup or salad and 2 vegetarian samosas to your entree choice.  pretty good deal witn good portion sizes.  the food though - like i said, average.  the pad thai is decent, as well as the mango pork, lemongrass beef, and panang curry.  if you don't make it early enough on m-f lunch hour, be prepared to wait.

Vdecent pan-asian food.  their pad thai wasn't super authentic - the orange sauce reminded me of the color of general tso's sauce, and it didn't have a ton of flavor - but it was a big portion for only $8.  the atmosphere is cute, they have a decent beer list and champagne cocktails (my favorite), and service was pretty good.  the only annoying thing was that they can only split a check onto 3 different credit cards regardless of how big your party is.  the four of us didn't realize that they would literally total the bill and divide it into 3 even portions, so people who order cheaper entrees or drink water get charged extra.  if you're going with multiple people, just bring cash to save the hassle.  i'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their vegetarian dishes.

Vi've had some of the best loose leaf tea here... \u000a\u000ai've had mixed luck with the food -- one dinner was excellent whereas a lunch seemed too salty. definitely better to eat here rather than take out as i think the take-out suffers. for what it's worth, they do have beer and wine. i'm not super excited about this place, but i would probably go back if others wanted to go (i.e. i doubt if i would choose it myself again).

Vthis place makes me sad. why? because it used to be one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in pittsburgh. and, if i had written this review 5 years ago, it would have 5 stars for sure. now, spice island has been downgraded to 3 stars. i still go back for the nostalgia of it all. (i did used to eat here once a week.) the food is just not as good anymore. to me it tastes like what used to be good food but now has been mass produced so it's lost a lot of the refined flavors. the sauces used to be awesome, now not so much. \u000a\u000amy favorite dishes were/are: pad thai and chicken with string beans. it's still okay, but when you start off outstanding, okay just won't cut it. 3 stars for spice island, and mostly just for old time's sake. \u000a\u000asince this is an asian restaurant, and us asians are taught to strive for perfection and settle for nothing less, spice island's mom would say "what happened to the other 2 stars?" *\u000a\u000a__________________\u000a* painting a very broad stroke here, when an asian student goes home with a 97 on a test, his or her (or my) mom says, "what happened to the other 3 points?" it's negative reinforcement at it's best.

Vmy friends love this place.. i don't really understand what they see. everyone in my group always orders a java fried rice each, mine is a vegetarian version, maybe thats what makes it different for me. the fried rice is nice, but nothing to write home about. tastes a little burnt to me (or maybe thats the sauce). also try the samosa appetizer - its pretty awesome.

Vspice island provides a great overall dining experience.  their asian/fusion menu is impressive, and they have a wonderful selection of teas.  their portion size is large, so expect to take some food home with you.  prices are very reasonable, and the staff is very attentive.

Vi've been to phi several times and i really dig the vibe. it's dive-y, has friendly bartenders and decent beers on hand. it can get crowded but not obnoxiously so (unless you're trying to play darts and people keep getting in the way or bumping you) however, it does get obnoxiously smoky.

Vpamela's\u000a\u000ait's very rare that i eat breakfast out, the reason being is that most breakfasts served in restaurants are so basic or banal that they aren't worth paying for. the ones who have special items charge ridiculously high prices and having been in this industry for over 30 years i get repulsed at paying such exorbitant amounts for food that has such a infinitesimally low food cost.\u000a\u000awith that being said i can honestly say that pamela's is a breakfast restaurant that i would frequent often if i lived in pittsburgh. their service was fast, no that's wrong it was faster then fast, drinks order, drinks, food order, and bam food on the table. we were never rushed but the speed was phenomenal. also a special shout out to our server, a professional waitress, probably been working tables for 40 years and it showed - in a great way.\u000a\u000asuper friendly, offered spot-on suggestions, and just made for a great pleasant start of a day. thank you so much for being you.\u000a\u000aon to the food, we had the chorizo omelet, filled with chorizo, sour cream, cheese and avocado, mildly spicy but good, the lyonnais potatoes were not mushy or greasy and had some nice caramelized corners to them making them something i would serve at our house. two slices of toast accompanied this feast and it filled me up.\u000a\u000awe also tried the banana chocolate pancake, which is more of a crepe style pancake stuffed with bananas and chocolate chips of course a dollop of whipped cream on top. again a very filling dish, but oh so good.\u000a\u000apamela's is really a fancy diner - there menu is not extensive, but what we had was good and the value was there. overall damage for two plus drinks under $20 with tip. wow a typical diner experience in spokane  would have set us back at least $ 25 and the food would have been mediocre and the service average.\u000a\u000a5 stars because it's been one of the best diner experiences and best values i have had for breakfast in a long time.

Vmitchell's has been around for over 100 years and serves good ol' plain ol' cooking for lunch.  i warn you, virtually every hot dish they have is either red meat or deep-fried!  they have one of the best burgers in downtown.  a favorite is the mitchburger, which has bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion with their special sauce.  i like my burgers a little plainer, so i either skip the special sauce or i get the regular cheeseburger.\u000a\u000aanother favorite is the fish sandwich.  i thought fish was supposed to be healthy!  but this is a breaded, deep fried cod sandwich and it certainly rivals the one at the original oyster house, both for flavor and fattening-ness!  mmmm, susan, pump that insulin!\u000a\u000aif you do want "healthier" choices, mitchell's has wraps, packed with the filling of the day.  their starter salad is good, crisp, and cool and perfect on a hot day.  or you can try the mediterranean sampler, which is hummus and rustic bread served with olive oil for dipping, cheese, and olives.   \u000a\u000amitchell's also has booze, and while the "three-martini lunch" might be a thing of the past, you can slake your thirst well because they have a lot of beer on tap.  plus they have bottled beer and a good variety of wines.  \u000a\u000ain winter, i like to order their chili or their soups, both of which are home made from scratch.

Vif there was a button that said "not for vegetarians", i'd click it.\u000a\u000athat aside, my carnivorous friends really like the comfort food this place serves up, and the bar staff is quick and friendly for their happy hour.  a large chunk of the crowd in the afternoon and early evening are lawyers, as this is where they head after work in the nearby buildings.

Vseriously, if you're a vegan or vegetarian, might as well look elsewhere.  virtually everything on the menu here had parents at one time and/or has been through the deep fryer!  burgers, cheese stix, onion rings, fried chicken, yum!\u000a\u000ao but they are so known for their homemade soups and chili.  i came here with some coworkers and i ordered me a side salad (that's healthy, right?) and a bowl of chili.  the chili was savory good on a winter's day.

Vdefine comfort food...\u000a\u000ait's that good, stick-to-your-ribs chow you eat for lunch because you've had a really "monday" type of monday at work.  and you want to seek solace alone in a good, fattening burger that the second you bite into it, your problems melt away and you realize all's better with the world.  well at least until you get back from lunch.\u000a\u000aand believe you me, i was having one of those mondays today.  i was craving a good cheeseburger and fries by 11am!  and no, mcd's, wendy's, or bk would do.  with every applicant chasing me, every attorney riding my ass, and every employee hunting me down, i could taste more and more of that fabulous mitchburgher.  finally i was able to tear myself away from the madness and hustle down to mitchell's.  i savored every bite of that 1/2 lb of beef, bacon, and pepperjack cheese.  mmmmm!   looks like ol' susan is gonna have to hit the gym tonight!

Vyou know what the problem with having a tummy bug is?  well for me it's that after a day and a half of feeling miserable and having no appetite, i'm h-u-n-g-r-y afterwards.  and what better way to satiate a post recuperation hunger with a good burger?  and i mean a really good burger!  \u000a\u000asuch was the case this past week with me.  i took care of it with a good mitchburgher burger.  mmmmm!   i ate that entire 1/2 lb beef patty with all it's charbroiled goodness topped off with lettuce, onion, pepperjack cheese and their special sauce--with a side of fries.  my coworker looked at me in amazement and asked "my lord, susan, where'd you put all that"?\u000a\u000ahey, when you've got the post flu munchies, you've gotta take care of 'em.

Vlet's be honest - those 'famous' sandwiches aren't very good at all. 50 years ago, they were probably cutting edge; nowadays they are throw back, dull and boring. i'm sorry i just can't get excited about french fries and cole slaw on a sandwich. \u000a\u000ahowever it is pittsburgh history and it definitely a large tourist trap, i can also why people go to the other locations to catch a game and have a beer. but with that being said if you are going here to try their sandwiches because some tv show told you they are the best - you will find that you have been lied to.\u000a\u000ago for the history, go to say you have done it, but don't go expecting an amazing gourmet sandwich experience.

Vi guess i'm a non-local hater who doesn't get it?  it had so much hype that i was let down when my mind was not blown at all and instead i longed for the cheesesteaks i used to order from a greasy spoon down the street when i was in high school instead of what i was actually eating.  i am a lifelong hater of coleslaw too, that probably didn't help.

Vit was worth the long walk over from where i was staying, i'd have to say that much! i figured this was a cash only place but also did not realize how small they are. they did have a few seatings for small groups and bar stool sitting for those (which was many were) come alone for a meal before heading to their destination. the guys were super friendly and everything was quick. \u000a\u000ai loved the pastrami sandwich that was filled with pastrami, cheese, cole slaw (even tho i'm not normally a fan) and fries. there is no right way of eating it or a clean way of eating it for that matter. it will fall apart on you. i was ambitious and got the hot chilli also which i was glad i did ... but my stomach yelled at me for stuffing so much in there in one sitting. if you're a light eater.... you may want to pack the other half. the best part is,  you can kick back and have a beer for like $3 (coors) with your meal.

Vprimanti's is a pittsburgh tradition since 1975.  you can't completely understand pittsburgh unless you visit primanti's.    i wouldn't here all the time, but every so often i get the craving.  it's a unique dining experience, and they don't try to be exactly like everyone else, that's what makes eating here so charming.  the food is fresh and it's sandwiches you can't always get other places.

Vmaybe 3 1/2.   lemon creme scone i love you!   it's loud, crowded, and you *will* wait on a weekend.  the service is also inconsistent as my ticket has been lost on two occasions (once they gave me a gift certificate to replace it after the 30 minute wait for my food!).  after a few years i've decided to skip the full on breakfast unless it's on a cold and snowy tuesday  and go for the scones and coffee.

Vi heard great things about this place but boy do i not know my way around madison! i was able to find this charming quaint breakfast place though. there is a parking lot but can be hard depending on the time of day. i shot over when it opened and found parking and a seat.\u000a\u000athis is a cash only place. they have a atm and i was glad to see the fee was not $6 but rather a mere $1 and change.\u000a\u000ai found the waffle with pecans and banana intriguing and ordered it. i wasn't disappointed and even inspired a few to have a similar breakfast that morning. i picked up a variety of their scones to go. i don't have any complaints about them even when i dug into one of them 2 days later! \u000a\u000athey do have a penguin on a stick in the back..... fake of course. i think it might be for their garden. unless i'm mistaken and it's not their garden at all!

Vbellagio was originally named beau rivage but, the name was later changed to bellagio. it's a beautifully water themed resort inspired by the lake como resort of bellagio in italy. it's most notable feature is the 8 acre lake between the building and the strip, which houses the fountains of bellagio, a large dancing water fountain synchronized to music. see my review of the fountains for more info on it. \u000a\u000abellagio was conceived by steve wynn and built by his company, mirage resorts, inc. following the purchase and demolition of the dunes hotel and casino in 1993. bellagio was designed by deruyter butler and atlandia design. bellagio opened october 15, 1998 and had a construction cost of $1.6 billion. \u000a\u000ain 2000 it became a mgm mirage property when mirage resorts was sold to mgm grand inc. for $6.4 billion by steve wynn to create mgm mirage. after the sale of mirage resorts steve wynn started a new company, wynn resorts. \u000a\u000aall in all i love bellagio! it was steve wynn's crowning achievement until wynn las vegas was built. the atmosphere, fountains, food, shopping and service are all 5 stars. tons of great shopping like armani, chanel, dior, fendi, gucci, prada, tiffany and ysl in via bellagio! i have never stayed there so i can't compare the rooms but the hotel and casino are almost neck and neck with wynn las vegas and that's saying alot!. forget aria and the rest of city center and stay either here, wynn or encore. you'll have a great time. \u000a\u000ai have added a picture of steve wynn's original concept for beau rivage which later became the bellagio. \u000a\u000ainsider tip: check will the hotel concierge for times but, you can go on a free tour of all of the different rooms types at bellagio daily around 3pm. and you don't need to be a hotel guest to go on the tour.

Vnew york, new york took my wife and i's vegas virginity away from us back in august of 2006. it was hotter than hell that week! 110 to 118 the whole time we were there!\u000a\u000athis is one of the last themed hotels on the strip. we had a great time at this hotel. the roller coaster was fun but made me sick. everyone who worked at the hotel was very nice and pleasant. our room was clean and comfortable and had a great view of the mountains. those were the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets i have ever seen!\u000a\u000amy only two complaints are that our room was right near the roller coaster which made it hard to sleep at times and the fact that this hotel is far from all the action in the middle of the strip. (wynn, caesars, bellagio etc) you are also around all of the "porn slappers" and the people that try to get you to take timeshare tours.\u000a\u000aall and all a solid place to stay while in vegas.

Vcoming with high sushi expectations after reading the reviews and seeing the menu, our dinner was pretty mediocre. don't get their specialty cocktails unless you love sugar, they are all very sweet. i had the champagne rose and it was undrinkable, even after the ice melted. \u000a\u000afor food, we got tuna tartare that was extremely salty. kobe beef short ribs with foie gras - it was actually just the meat, no ribs and the highlight of the savory part of dinner. we also got 2 rolls, nothing memorable there. i've had better rolls from sushi boats on geary for $3. the dessert was a welcome lift in taste - their tiramisu with cappuccino foam was tasty!\u000a\u000athe service was nice and our waiter expressed concern about our "okay" dining experience. the restaurant itself is trendy but noisy.

Vi really like biaggi's; the atmosphere in there is kind of a salving balm to the grody campus or slut-tacular downtown vibe.  it's clean and more refined than most other places you'll find in champaign, with good service and a lot of edible dishes.\u000a\u000ait's true what everyone else is saying; there's nothing impressive about the food.  i've never had anything bad though, and i actually think the prices are highly reasonable given the amount and quality of food and the atmosphere in which it is presented.\u000a\u000ayou need a reservation for dinner if you are going to wait for less than an hour on the weekend.

Vi have also never been inside kam's, and that is causally related to the reason i can still give it one star:  i have to walk by its vomit stench lined exterior every fucking day during school to get to the psych building, and on unofficial i have to endure having riot police stationed in the lobby of my building to prevent the kam vomit and mayhem flow from infiltrating the psychology building.  \u000a\u000athe vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings!  when i was in college, i went to bars that didn't card too, but on the real i still don't understand why anyone would go to kam's.

Vi didn't realize this place was a chain but it was still decent. there were many tables for a large crowd during lunch and even parking spaces! \u000a\u000athe menu features sandwiches of many types -- warm and cold. also, pizzas and new salads are on the menu. the cranberry, apple, pecan, and chicken salad was great and had the right amount of dressing on the side. it came with few pieces of cheesy bread that was mouth watering. fountain drinks and bottle drinks of choice and many side bags of chips. from what i hear, the reuben is amazing.

Vi agree with tim b.  the best cheese curds in town and fail-safe.  i always have a good time and good conversation here (though be forewarned, it's loud!).  i dig the scene and the ambiance, the drinks are *very* affordable and flow readily (great beer specials & i love their old fashioned!).  no. 20 is delicious -- can't go wrong with door county cherries -- and the salad seemingly offsets the inevitable amount of cheese curds and alcohol i will consume at this venue.  though i have been known, on occasion, to order the grilled cheese with bacon.  shame.  \u000a\u000athe service is potentially spotty -- especially on friday and saturday nights.  in fact, on one occasion i'm quite sure our waitress was completely stoned.  water refills are also hard to come by sometimes.  that said, i've never waited more than 20 minutes even with large parties.  \u000a\u000aand the apple pie with a slice of hook's aged cheddar?  don't pass it up.

Vi haven't had lunch at cafe soleil yet...but the bakery happy hour is absolutely worth a visit (maybe even an extra 1/2 star for value!).  the espresso drinks are well done (on 4 of 5 occasions) and the savory croissants are lovely, as is the blueberry cream cheese croissant.  the homemade lemonade is delicious and refreshing, especially with free refills.  i've lucked out on days with blueberry and raspberry lemonade...yum!  local cheeses and farmer's market goods as an added bonus. \u000a\u000aspend a lazy afternoon here, reading the paper or working on a paper.  avoid the hectic farmer's market crowd on saturdays.

Vmediocre club. only worth going if you're actually staying at ti. \u000a\u000amusic was bad, the floors were sticky, the dance floor was crowded, and most of the guys at the club were dirty. the place was probably 75% dudes. the odds are good ladies, but the goods were odd. \u000a\u000athe only way i would go back is if i was staying at ti again and there was a snow storm in lv that trapped me inside the hotel.

Vthe nationality rooms are a must-see.  i especially enjoy them during december, when the holiday decorations are up.  in addition to the gorgeous artifacts and decorations of each room, traditional holiday decorations are featured with an information sheet detailing the holiday traditions of the country.\u000a\u000athe attention to detail in all of these rooms is truly amazing.  each country commissions top artisans to create everything from the light-switch plates to the radiator covers and murals.  they range from the ornate austrian room to the more minimalist japanese room, with plans for more on the way.  small kids might not have the attention span to handle all the rooms, but teenagers and older would probably enjoy it.  keep in mind, it is hot in the winter - leave your coat in the car.  also allow about 2-2.5 hours if you want to really explore every detail of the room, but you can probably get through them faster if you want.  (the guided tours take 90 minutes.)\u000a\u000aif you visit during the week, there is a coffee shop, a sushi bar, and a chil-fil-a in the basement.  meters available on bigelow and bellefield, around the schenley quad, and on roberto clemente dr.

Vnationality rooms\u000a\u000ai love taking visitors to the nationality rooms at the cathedral of learning.  there is something unique about each of the 27 rooms, and it's something that no other city has.  my favorite is the early american room, although i don't think you can do anything other than look through the window at this room.  there's a secret room in the early american room...used for hiding on the frontier.  but there other other amazing rooms to see as well.  the best day to tour the rooms is on sunday, but make sure you call ahead to find out the hours and availability.  they decorate some of the rooms for christmas, so that's a good season to visit the rooms.

Vthe cathedral of learning, what can i say that hasn't been said about this place.  yes, it's beautiful; no one can deny that, especially since they finally gave it a bath after nearly 60 years after its construction completed.  is it tall?  of course.  it is the second tallest university building in the world (damn you russia).  we all know it is a diversified building with all the nationality rooms (29 at present count).  plus, people kind of refer to it as hogwarts at times.\u000a\u000awhat you may not know, don't go all the way up to the highest floor you can.  it's quite awesome to go up and take in the view of oakland and in the distance downtown.  but don't try a door that quite possibly may be connected to the fire alarm system...it will not open!  also, it may set off the fire alarm and then you are demanded by overhead speaker to evacuate the building...by stairs.  do you know what it feels like to walk down 39 flights of awkward stairs?  it's not fun, not fun at all.  what the kicker is, as my family and i reached the bottom of the stairs, the fire alarm was finally cleared.  i kid you not, my foot just hit the floor after the last step, and it was cleared.\u000a\u000anever again cathedral, never!  but i still love you, you are beautiful and don't listen to what some of the foreign exchange student refer to you as.

Vduring my week-long "in-town vacation" (which wasn't nearly long enough), i decided to take advantage of the cultural attractions that pittsburgh has to offer.  believe it or not, i'd never been to the mattress factory before!  \u000a\u000aso, having a day to myself, i decided to head over to see what all the fuss was about.  it's an unusual place to say the least, and it features room-sized exhibitions in an old building on pittsburgh's north side.  they offer lectures, tours, and they let people discover the connections between art and their everyday lives.  they even have rental spaces available for private parties, wedding receptions, and exhibitions.\u000a\u000athe current exhibition is "inner and outer space."  i'm not really into contemporary art, but it was fascinating to see the artists use all types of media including painting and video.  one peice i did like was "instant before incident" and the artist created a sculpture of a 1908 fiat, moments before an impact.  another peice used mannequins and polka dots, and to me it looked like mannequins at a twister game!\u000a\u000ait's reasonably priced at $10.00 to get in for adults.  but, cmu students get in free all year, whereas pitt students get in free only during fall & spring semesters.  hmm, i'm a pitt grad, so it loses a star for that!

Valthough the mattress factory is literally on my street and i get free admission for being a grad student at pitt, i've only visited once.\u000a\u000amy friend and i stopped on a sunny afternoon, and toured both the main museum and the annex gallery.  it was interesting, but definitely by no means the best museum experience i've ever had.  i've heard the cafe is amazing, so if i go back i'll update this review accordingly.  \u000a\u000amy favorite piece was "my offering," a room full of plaster hands holding breadworks bread.  \u000a\u000amy least favorite was a dark room where you were supposed to sit until something appeared.  we got so freaked out that they were watching us with a camera and were going to pop out haunted house style and scare the crap out of us.  but then again, maybe that was the art...?

Vyou had me at tater tots, but then you had to one up that and make them out of sweet potatoes.  i think i may love you now.  you have filled a void i didn't even know i had.\u000a\u000awe arrived during a lunch time rush but were seated immediately and we didn't have to wait a minute for the waitress to come over.  with our drink orders placed we decided to read over the menu and then make our selections.  we started with the shady sticks and were happy with those.  all they are is a pizza with the sauce on the side for dipping.  i mean it's like a medium sized pizza, so a very good portion and the dough was so sweet and mixed with the three types of cheese on it was great.  for my main course i opted for the california blt.  when i ordered this i was assuming that it was going to be run of the mill, thrown together blt.  was i ever surprised.  multigrain bread topped with applewood bacon, crispy lettuce and thickly sliced tomatoes.  i was most surprised by the tomatoes, i was expecting uniformly cut and small.  what i got was like someone took a tomato from a basket, cut it quickly and didn't care how it looked, i approve!\u000a\u000anow, back to those tater tots!  i am completely infatuated with them.  they were crunchy and puffy and so delightful.  just the right size to pop in your mouth and munch away.  their side of cajun ranch is an amazing compliment.  i was as near to heaven as i could be with those, no joke.\u000a\u000ai also opted for the blackberry mojito.  best way to describe it is by saying it was bittersweet.  the mint played off of the blackberry and it played well.\u000a\u000aseating was nice, at a high table, we were at the corner that we could not only people watch inside the restaurant, but we could also people watch on the sidewalk.  televisions on, music blaring, people singing, it was a great atmosphere.

Vgreat place for breakfast. i highly recommend the steak and hash browns. they are outstanding! the orange juice is great as well. the service is always great and the food comes out hot and fast. \u000a\u000ai eat here at least once every time i'm in vegas.

Vsuper expensive and not necessarily fair trade!  a dirty chai will set you back about $5 for a 12 oz. mug and their baked goods resemble costco or some other cheap amalgamation of mass produced croissants.  i used to study here in the winter but i'll take the extra bike ride down to indie or barriques.

Vi don't see what the big deal is about this place. yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. we both had the crab cakes and they were horrible! and the service sucks. we were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. \u000a\u000athe bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. and she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.\u000a\u000ai should've gone to the capital grille instead.

Vafter writing a review about a bbq chain restaurant red hot & blue that has a location in pittsburgh, i started thinking back to the best barbeques i've ever had. two stand out - mac's speed shop in charlotte, nc and jack's in nashville, tn. it's been a few months since i've eaten at mac's, but i think my memory will serve me right.\u000a\u000amac's is, so i've been told, authentic north carolinian bbq. it's not the same as southern bbq, nor is it the same as kansas city bbq, for those who know the difference. like all good bbq places, they have their own versions of bbq. i forget which one it is, but one of them was really good. (helpful, right?)\u000a\u000aii had the beef brisket ignoring one of my dining friends' warning that it was fatty. little did he know that i love my beef brisket marbled! it was pretty good, just the right amount of fat for me, which is usually too much fat for a normal person. so, that was both my plug and my warning to those of you who would consider ordering the brisket. i also tried the pulled pork, which was really moist and tasty. if you're undecided about the brisket now, you won't go wrong with the pulled pork. better yet, order a combo platter and taste it all. as for the sides, i think mac's does it right. the top two sides are hush puppies and the mac and cheese. \u000a\u000abeer. if you like beer, you will like the mac's beer list. they have a lot of beers both on tap and bottled. \u000a\u000aas for the biker image, yes, mac's speedshop is supposed to be some big biker joint. roll up on your harley's and eat some bbq like real tough men (and women). inside the restaurant is just like an old converted garage, like many themed restaurants. this one isn't any better or worse, but it's nothing to really mention one way or the other. the night i was there, it really did just seem like young 20/30-somethings out drinking with their friends in t-shirts, maybe button downs for those who strut the work look, and jeans. i didn't see any leather jackets, but i could have just gone on a non-biker day. \u000a\u000aeither way, it's bbq tough enough for bikers, enjoyable by all.

Vmaybe 2 1/2.  \u000a\u000ai tried fresco on two separate occasions this summer for the fresco fives -- perfect for grad students who want nice dining and drinks but can't afford the full menu.  but why?  why on earth do they close so early!?  the last hour of the day, fresco offers a $5 menu with a limited (very limited and even more limited on my second visit!) selection of wine, martinis, and small plates.  i had the scallops, tuna, lamb "sliders", and mushroom and leek tartlet.  the tuna is good and packed with flavorful fried capers but i like my sashimi thick!  the lamb sliders were, well, a bit weird.  the beet flavor threw me off but hey, i like beets.  the mushroom and leek tartlet is a bit bland but the scallops?  awesome!  can't go wrong with nueske's bacon!  before i ordered i made sure to check that they were flown in that day, fresh as possible for madison.  they were and they *were* delicious!   the $5 wine selection is okay but the view is fantastic.  my dining partner had a refreshing but potent 50/50 martini.  pass on certain desserts -- the honey-poached pear brulee was substandard with a weird aftertaste.  the thought of fresco fives in the winter is much less appealing to me.    to sum it up, any future visit might involve two plates of bacon wrapped scallops, a glass of wine or a martini, a view, and moving on to better things at the tornado room or other alternative late night menus.\u000a\u000aps  a friend of mine has raved about  the lamb lollipop chops.

Vi came here with a friend and her young child for my first visit.  what a nice and friendly place!  the staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend.  i ended up getting a white tea which was nice.  \u000a\u000athe cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench).  i believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs.  in addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children!  my friend's child ahd the time of his life.  \u000a\u000ai'll definitely be going back!

Vbefore checking out a matinee at the nearby manor theatre, my friend marla and i decided to have a little bite to eat.  we'd never been here before.  it's amazing how a place can be right around the corner from you, yet it's ages before you try it.\u000a\u000abut this is a neat little place in squirrel hill and it's one of the reasons why i love living in this neighborhood so much.  there are so many individual stores and cafes that make it so preferable to "strip mall suburbia".\u000a\u000athis is a tea house and not a coffee house.  so don't go looking for ye olde cup of joe here.  they have many varities of teas here:  blacks, reds, herbals, whites, greens.  they might seem a little pricey here, but they do serve you a 16oz pot here.  and they have all kinds of sandwiches and baked goods here including a cashew butter and jelly sandwich (which i didn't try) and a southwestern wrap, which was very good.\u000a\u000aif you are looking for gifts for the tea drinker in your life, they have all sorts of gifts available.  they also have kosher teas too.

Vi used to go here all the time when i lived in the city, now i only make it a couple fo times a month.  dean and richie (owners) are total pittsburgh originals.  you have to have the right expectations with this place.  the steaks are not as good as capital grille, mortons, etc.. but, they are very reasonably priced and are good.. not great...but good.  i suggest you just have a cheesburgher or try the filet/portabella appetizer (which used to be the best deal in town at 8.95, however now i think it's like $13).  my buddy dan is the bartender and he's been doing it since he was 18 about 1/2 his life so he knows what he's doing you'll have fine conversation if you go alone and end up talking to the bartender all night.  the other bartender is good too.. josh.

Vi've been to pittsburgh steak company a couple times.... once to try their steak and once for their prime rib special monday nights (all you can eat for 17 bucks)\u000a\u000atheir steak is moderately priced, but underseasoned (a little more salt + pepper please!) and lacked the nice sear outside i like.  i've had better tasting steaks at chain restaurants...\u000a\u000amore importantly though, their all you can eat prime rib dinner.  it starts out with a generic italian bread with butter.  next up comes an iceberg salad that is still wet from the bag and soggy cucumber slices.  their prime rib came next.  they start at medium rare; they can't do rare, which is disappointing.  the first piece of prime rib was underseasoned, extremely chewy, and was a really poor piece of meat in general.  excess fat, and not in the marbled good sort of way.  also excess silverskin.  gross.\u000a\u000ai will say that the second piece was much better though.  but inconsistent quality.....  halfway through my third piece (overcooked) i decided to stop w/ the meat and just eat bread to fill up.\u000a\u000ait also came with a side; i picked creamed spinach.  pretty standard.\u000a\u000alike neal said, no it's not capital grille or morton's, but there's no reason to settle for mediocre to sub-par steaks either... or is there?

Vprobably one of the more underwhelming experiences i've had since getting to pittsburgh.\u000a\u000aservice was slow.  i felt sorry for the guy - i don't think he was bad, but maybe they were understaffed?  anyway, it took about 15 minutes for me to get my water (but only 5 for my friends to get wine and beer?).  we didn't get our entrees for an hour.  \u000a\u000ai got the prime rib, and my friends got the ny strip steak and ribs.  i opted out of getting the salad, because i was pretty sure it was going to be bad.  lo and behold, it was your standard iceberg lettuce with almost no toppings, drenched in salad dressing.  even one of my friends decided not to touch the thing.  i thought i had dodged a bullet with that one, but was stuck snacking on the tasteless bread.  \u000a\u000amy prime rib was pretty... lifeless.  one does expect steaks to be lifeless by the time they get to the table, but this one simply lacked any sort of flavor at all.  i resorted to drenching the thing in horseradish, which resulted in several wasabi inspired nose clearing moments.  i think my friends' dishes were ok.  nothing to write home about.\u000a\u000ai think pittsburgh steakhouse co is probably good if you don't care about steak.  the place is old fashioned and clearly meets the needs of a certain clientele.  but if you are looking for flavorful beef, don't come here.

Vdecent place to grab a steak.\u000a\u000amy wife knowing the carnivore the i am picked the pittsburgh steak company for father's day since it was about the only steak house in pittsburgh that we hadn't tried yet.\u000a\u000athe three of us walked in and where seated immediately as we had reservations. we started off with the crab dip and it was very good. ($8.95)\u000a\u000ai ordered the montreal porterhouse with a salad and baked potato as my entree. ($29.95) the wife ordered the medallions of filet (filet medallions prepared in a brandy sauce with mushroom, peppers and onions.) with a salad and baked potato ($20.95) and our daughter ordered the.............................drum roll................................. kids cheeseburger and fries. ($5.95)\u000a\u000afyi they do offer a kid's menu you just have to ask.\u000a\u000aour salads were good and the dressing was really good. the fresh bread offered with them was tasty as well. \u000a\u000amy porterhouse was good but, it wasn't outstanding. it was tender and juicy. the montreal seasoning was pretty good but as others have stated my steak was missing something. i added salt, pepper and a1 steak sauce which helped but it was still missing something. not sure what. the baked potato was really good though.\u000a\u000amy wife said her steak was about the same as mine. good but missing something. my daughter give me a couple fries and a piece of her burger and i was very surprised. they were both freakin outstanding! i will defiantly be back for a burger and fries.\u000a\u000aall in all our food was good and the service was good but, i just could not justify the price when capital grille, hyde park, morton's and ruth chris are some much better for pretty much the same price.

Vthe staff is incredibly friendly, the crowd is always happy, the food is tasty, healthy, and inexpensive.  i can't ask more of a restaurant.\u000a\u000aopen for lunch only, sree's serves four fully vegan vegetarian dishes and one chicken dish daily.  choose chicken + one veggie or three veggie dishes for $5.\u000a\u000athe menu repeats weekly; that is, every monday has the same options, every tuesday has a different set of options, and so on.  the menu changes up from season to season; currently, the menthi carrots (monday) and aloo saag (spinach potato, thursday) are my two favorites.  \u000a\u000athe food is cooked off-site, and brought into this small space for lunch daily.  sree and his family have three other locations, including a full restaurant in sharpsburg.\u000a\u000aprobably the healthiest, tastiest, and best value in all of downtown pittsburgh.

Vi really wanted to like sree's more than i did.  ray and i stopped in a day or two prior to the g20 summit when downtown was virtually a ghost town (kinda like a weekend day in pgh, but this was a wednesday).  it's a small place in a v shaped building with two entrances.  ray and i walk in for the first time and no one really is in the spot (again g20).  the tables are on both sides of the building facing the wall with paper towels and plastic silverware, hot sauce scattered around.  there is an extremely pleasant indian lady behind the heated trays who greets us warmly with a broad smile and a pleasant demeanor (this is one of the reasons i wanted to rate this place better).  the meals are very cheap at $5 for the chicken curry, rice and another vegetable (think some type of chick pea).  i also appreciate their selection of drinks which includes coconut water.  i kinda had an idea what i was gonna be in for when i looked at the sad bread.  i was expecting roti or naan, but this was cold semi stale pita.  we have a seat and being somewhat of a curry maven i look forward to a flavorful lunch, but sadly the meat is somewhat dry and the curry lacks any real flavor or spice.  the rice is fine and i've already commented on the pita.  the chick pea side had a little more flavor, but still nothing close to good.  the lady was so endearing that i almost gave the place three stars, however the food really was sub par.  i can only imagine they are specifically tailoring this food to the masses who want cheap food and are only dabbling in indian flavors with the tamed down flavor level.  i probably won't go back.

Vsree's advertises "curry in a hurry". the place is reminiscent of an elementary school cafeteria: a small sign with today's options, a hot food line, with up to two people behind the buffet scooping orders into styrofoam boxes, and a cash register. along the sides, there is bench seating, all complete with plastic utensil holders, paper towel rolls, and squeeze-bottles filled with a delicious and very spicy hot sauce.\u000a\u000aif nothing else, the place is a bargain: $5 will get you the styrofoam box full of food - be it a large portion of tamarind chicken, or a selection of 3 out of 4 daily vegetarian offerings. along with that, two big scoops of white rice and 'naan'(really, half of a cold white-flour pita).\u000a\u000athe quality is where i feel really leaves desired, though. the food sits out, the the ingredients often taste canned, or otherwise processed. while the food has more flavor than, say, a subway sandwich, i feel that as far as indian food goes it is rather bland, unless you put enough hot sauce on it.\u000a\u000ataking this place for what it is, cheap indian food, it is a stop that is nice to your appetite and your wallet. if you don't work nearby, though, it's not worth a trip.

Vmexican food.  authentic mexican food, not tex-mex, cal-mex, or taco bell.\u000a\u000aeverything is always very fresh, and for lunch, it's hard to beat.  \u000a\u000athey've just moved two doors down, to a much larger location, and i'm interested to see how they do with the additional space.

Vwhile this is not the millennium force or maverick at cedar point it is a fun ride. the price to ride is steep but for my wife and i it was free because we were staying in the hotel.\u000a\u000ai was quite sick and dizzy after the ride for over an hour though. thank god our room was right up stairs!

Vlove the ambiance of this cafe in lawrenceville, located very close to piccolo forno and the 40th street bridge.  i had heard great things about the restaurant and was excited to try it out.  \u000a\u000athe place is packed and with a lengthy waitlist on sunday mornings.  we got there and had our name on the list by 10:45 am and still had to wait about an hour to get seated.  and then, getting our meals took a long time also.  i actually went with the server's suggestion and got a special (smoked salmon frittata) - not the best, it turns out.  the frittata was especially dense and nothing to write home about and it came with 2 small pieces of smoked salmon on top.  hmmm.  the french toast and sage ham meals that i saw looked good, and probably would be my choice the next time.  later, i heard that avoiding the specials and sticking to the basics of the menu is usually your best bet.  \u000a\u000aprice-wise, it's about on par with other brunch locations in the city.  while a bit more inconvenient with respect to the wait and location, i am sure i will be back here for the different menu options and the charm of the cafe.

Vi heard so much hype about this place, i was seriously put off and hesitant to try it. i heard that the vegetarian and vegan options were slim. plus, the hours are a little early for me, and i just kept missing them. one morning though, pressed to find a vegetarian/vegan brunch in lawrenceville for a spontaneous brunch date, we sidled up to coca to be surprised and delighted. \u000a\u000athe wait for a table was less than 5 minutes, even though every table appeared full and it was a sunday morning at prime brunch hour. maybe they conjured it up. the space is darling - ground-level store front on lawrenceville's main drag, bright colors, precious art, so squeaky clean, a well-maintained antique feel. the table service was provided by a series of remarkable people -- they were all quick, inoffensive, practically invisible, but helpful & attentive. i literally cannot remember the last time i paid less than $20 for a meal and felt pampered. \u000a\u000aordering from the menu, i felt the vegan options were a little sparse, but a vegetarian could have their pick of choices. \u000a\u000aand then the food arrived! everything we ordered was scrumptious. not in the "satisfactorily good" sort of way -- but actually, each bite was a surprising delight. i expected a passable veggie-friendly brunch on a moment's notice, but i was amazed by what actually happened. tucked into a tiny booth in a back, bright yellow room, my brunch buddy & i marveled at perfect fluffy asparagus omelettes (hers) and a southwest-inspired tofu veggie pico scramble wrapped in a warm tortilla. the tofu scramble was, perhaps, a low spot in the meal. it was good, but i have been spoiled by the finger-lickin' tofu scrambles at other sites. \u000a\u000awhen we left, after stand-up drip coffee and pleasant conversation, we were pleasurably stuffed. my brunch date remarked on what a nice place, what a great neighborhood, and how smart of me to chose such a great spot! this is the mark of a quality dining experience - to elevate yourself & your neighborhood's value in the eyes of a visitor. \u000a\u000acoca, what a pleasant surprise!

Vjust got back from trying this place for the first time.  right up front, *enormous* bonus points for the best restaurant website i've seen in months; the front page has address and hours in easy to find, clear text.  (is that so much to ask of all the other restaurants around?)\u000a\u000athey had every table full on a friday at noon, but no wait, which was good.  definitely seemed like a place best well-timed; avoid busier times of the day, i think.  service was very friendly, and a hair slow due to the full restaurant.\u000a\u000athat said, the white omelette was good, as was the brie-stuffed french toast.  both could have used a touch more cheese, maybe; not sure if anyone else would agree, as i really love some cheese.  cinnamon bread was surprisingly understated and awesome.  the art on the walls was actually first-class, which was more than a little surprising to me.\u000a\u000ai'll head back soon.

Vcoca's had super bright colors and a cute cozy feel which was definitely a refreshing change from the monotony of the brunch locations around carnegie mellon university where i go to school.\u000a\u000awe got there around 11:30 and put our names down; we were told there would be around a 30-40 min wait so we walked around the neighborhood for a bit.\u000a\u000ai had their smoked salmon omelet and a double cappuccino.  she got their creme brulee french toast and a mixed greens salad.\u000a\u000acappuccino was pretty standard; it was slightly above average but not super special.\u000a\u000asmoked salmon omelet came with grilled potatoes and a slice of watermelon.  the omelet also had sliced cherry tomatoes, scallions and dill.  super fluffy and tasty; i'd definitely get it again!\u000a\u000ai tried a couple pieces of the creme brulee french toast and it was sinfully delicious.\u000a\u000anote: get there early or you'll have to wait (they open at 10 am; there was still a wait as we left after 1 pm), and they might also be out of some of their specials (they were out of their crab hash).\u000a\u000aon the car ride back we were already discussing what we'd get the next time we head back.

Vi like the food at coca a lot, and i've never had a problem getting seated(even on a sunday), however if i was going on a peak hour i would definitely call ahead. i love that they take your cell phone number and call you when a table is ready - take your time and walk around lawrenceville instead of hanging around outside waiting.\u000a\u000amy biggest complaint though is that the service can be slow sometimes. i've been in there a few times where it has taken longer to be greeted than to get a seat.\u000a\u000athey have a small patio if the weather suits.

Voh god, is this place good. the food is great & fairly traditional brunch fare, although the use of different types of cheeses helps spice things up. the smoothies are fantastic, too.\u000a\u000alike every other popular place, be prepared to wait on the weekend. that being said, coca will call your cell phone so you can go down the street and shop while you wait. this is just great service & really pushes coca over to 5 stars.

Vit's been a couple of years since i've been here so i got excited when i was asked to lunch. i ordered asparagus bisque and sesame crusted tofu salad with ginger carrot vinegrette. the bisque needed salt, good thing coca cafe is not one of those pretentious places that do not have s&p shakers readily available. everyones palette is different, it just makes no sense to me...a little salt really livened up the creamy asparagus, my only complaint is that the spoon was too big! oh my goodness! i had to unhinge my jaws to fit that spoon inside my mouth! it was bigger than the slice of bread they gave me.\u000a\u000aim sorry, back to the food. i absolutely love anything with ginger in it, so i thought my salad was very tasty. my friend ordered an omlett that came with fried potatoes and a fresh fruit cup. while she throughly  enjoyed the omlett, she commented that potatoes were pretty bland (thank goodness for those teeny-tiny salt and pepper shakers) they even required hot sauce and ketchup, but hey! those potatoes were really the only disappointing item, everything else was delicious

Vi know it's a chain and i try not to review chains, but damn are these burgers and fries good.  however, i'd heard other compare them to in n out on the left coast and i'd disagree because while they are quite good they do not compare to the first time i fell in love (in n out burger).  okay, went here with mom yesterday for lunch.  i was a bit surprised to find it relatively empty and no wait at all.   the cashier greeted us with a warm, genuine smile and even gave mom a compliment on her blouse.  she knew how to work the tip jar.  i ordered the "little" bacon cheeseburger and it was plenty big and really reasonable priced.  i had it with sauteed onions and mushrooms (no extra charge) and a bit of mayo.  mom was more traditional with a "little" burger with l, t, o and ketchup and mustard.  we ordered one drink to share and a "regular" cajun fries.  the total cost was under $13 and we had plenty of fries left over.  the burger itself was really flavorful, juicy, and the bun was soft and warm.  the fries were some of the best i've ever had in any restaurant.  i think it's because they are fresh cut daily and double fried in peanut oil.  the restaurant only serves burgers and fries, so not to much to think about.  i don't really care that they don't serve milkshakes i think i did enough artery clogging with the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  tessaros is still the best hands down, but if you are looking for a great quick burger and friendly service for mickey d's prices.  this is the place to go.  i will become a regular.

Vfries are good. i can't speak about the burgers though. i wish they had cheese to dip those delicious potato sticks into, but they're great even when they're plain.

Vfor retro home furnishings, jeff definitely has the largest selection in pittsburgh, and he really knows his stuff - you can even see books discussing various topics from housewares to furniture scattered throughout the store... for sale, of course.\u000a\u000ayou can hunt up and down these aisles for hours, and still find something new with each pass. the front is mostly furniture - tables, buffets, dressers, the back will find a bit more seating(not to say that the former and latter aren't interspersed). the left hand side is also mostly all wood, including a collection of wooden salt and pepper grinders.\u000a\u000ain the back right is most of the housewares - glasses, kitchen utensils, various forms of decor, old phones, gadgets, knick-knacks, etc. this is usually where i spend most of my time. some of my favorite things i've seen are an entirely clear telephone, a (porcelain?) statue of a grouse, and a set of plates and glasses decorated with little things that remind me of  germs\u000a\u000ajeff keeps his stuff in exceptional condition - i have never seen a piece that wasn't in next-to-new condition. all of the glassware i have bought from him has all of the gold entirely in-tact. once i found a salt grinder in the front whose wheel didn't turn. he took it and tried to fix it, and when he couldn't he took it off the shelf... shame, since i liked it\u000a\u000athe reason for the star deduction is his prices - they're really outrageous if you ask me. maybe i'm spoiled by other shops in the area which i think charge reasonable prices, but his are always at least double what i'd be expecting to pay at another place. maybe he makes them high so he can be bartered down a lot(i haven't bought a big enough piece to care to try too hard), maybe it's just because he knows his stuff better than everyone else... but don't expect to come here and get a deal\u000a\u000aother than that, though, this store is a blast to come visit, and who can put a price on the perfect piece of furniture? come check it out

Vthis review is for the newest location in monroeville.  i had lunch  here yesterday with some staff and what a great find!  it's located surrounded by office buildings in a strip mall  kind of place.  the space itself is okay with bright colors and about seating for 40.  it's byob and the food takes a long time, but it's really good fusion thai i'd call it.  the menu is massive.  we started with the roast duck summer rolls, which were maybe the best i've ever had.  it had really fresh crispy vegatables, delicious duck and a nice sauce.  i had the noodle hut special soup served with pork, crispy vegetables, roast pork and garlic.  the flavor was really good and the broth somewhat spicy.  my associates had the curry, which was really spicy and delicious served with chicken and rice.  the portions are not overwhelming and the service is okay, but again slow.  good addition to monroeville.

Vi hate to do this, but can't really overlook my last experience here hence the update and the 3 star review vs. 4 star initial review.  the food is still good, i mean really good thai food.  this is probably my favorite thai restaurant now and i like it even more than nicky's thai in verona and now n. side.  the service has been slipping and last week was the last straw.  so, we are seated i'm there with staff, etc.   there are 5 of us.  it takes about 10 minutes before the gal sets down the menu's.  this in an of itself is not good, but not awful either.  then we order we get some delicious summer rolls and then the power shuts down in the restaurant.  again, no problemo this is out of your control we'll just leave.  the waitress tells us that now that the power is back our food will be out later than expected but will still arrive.  we wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min... and we overhear her telling a customer when they walk in that they can only offer a couple cold items.  we get her attention and she comes back and we ask her how long for our food.  she now tells us that since the power shut off the gas is turned off and will be for the day, so we were basically waiting for nothing since we were never going to get our order.  i would have been fine if she told us this, but to have us all wait 30 minutes just to tell us we were never going to get our food and mind you she only told us this after we got her attention and asked directly.  it was totally crazy, i mean if i had never asked might we have waited theoretically all day?  the food is good, but i think i'll get take out next time.

Vi've been here a couple of times.  overall, i am just ok with the food.  having had more of a background in malaysian food, i am a bit more critical of the food here as it is more malaysian than singaporean.  the prices are more reasonable at lunch; i am not sure i would come for dinner.  most of the food on the lunch menu was good - that kari mee was delicious and the hananese chicken was decent too.  the mee goreng - not horrible, not great.  \u000a\u000athe service in general is quite good.

Vi first ate at sun penang over a year ago and remember it to be a decent meal. like most people have already said in their reviews, finding a restaurant for malaysian food in pittsburgh is in and of itself impressive. i think once i got over the novelty of finding a place for prawn noodles, hainanese chicken and roti canai, i could more objectively rate the restaurant itself. \u000a\u000ai just don't think sun penang deserves high praises for being the only place where you can get _______ in pittsburgh. this city is better than that! and, i believe the other reviews that say the food used to be better. so, before giving the stars away , let's make sun penang earn it again! \u000a\u000athe one saving grace is their outdoor seating. on that one beautiful pittsburgh spring day, having a meal while people-watching in squirrel hill is definitely a treat.

Vdropped in for a much-needed lunch after a day of apartment hunting.  we split two entrees - taylor had some form of curry chicken with potatoes, and i had a noodle dish with tofu, shrimp, mixed vegetables, chiles, and potatoes in a brown sauce.\u000a\u000aboth dishes were all right - mine was better by far.  still, it wasn't creative or unique at all - its appeal lay in its nostalgic flavor.  one bite, and i immediately thought "chinese food!"  i've been eating thai for so long, i'd almost forgotten the taste of chinese, but this was it.  americanized chinese food, anyway.  it's a good taste, just not a super-exciting one.  i'd skip the curry chicken with potatoes - the flavors were bland and it was served in a very thin sauce that was more like a broth.  \u000a\u000ai'd stop in again to try the dim sum, or if i wanted some simple take-out....but this was my first foray into asian food in pittsburgh, and i hope to find better!

Vwith a spacious bar that opens up to the street and a few tables on the sidewalk, this place looks so inviting. every time i passed by, i wanted to go in. when i finally got a chance to grab lunch here, it was so disappointing. we got dim sum: pork buns, sesame balls, lotus leaf sticky rice, taro and shrimp and probably something else. it was all pretty gross, even the fancy sounding lotus leaf.

Vhit or miss. i had a spicy seafood soup here which was divine, but i've also had utterly terrible green curry, a lousy mango salad, and uninspiring dim sum. this seems to be one of those restaurants which has a few really good dishes, but you really have to cross your fingers when ordering something unknown. on the plus side, the service has been friendly, and the atmosphere is pleasant enough.

Vi was extremely impressed by the malaysian specials on the menu.  i tried the mango chicken, and it was excellent, both in terms of presentation and taste.  my friend ordered the basil noodle and it was also very good.  with most entrees priced at 12 to 16 dollars, i think sun penang is an excellent value.

Vi have been here several times before, but last night was the first time i was on the rooftop deck.  the deck is probably the best thing about this place it's only too bad i discovered it at the end of summer.  the food overall is a little above average.  i'd consider it like an atrias with a little more flair in the menu and definitely nice that it's not a national chain.  this placed is owned by the fine folks at eat n park.  i sampled a few drinks in the downstairs bar having had a sip of a very good dry martini and enjoying a full serving of an average kettle one rocks dirty.  the wine selection was relatively week and even though the prices were good for the wine i would have paid more for a better selection.  the sangria was a little too sweet and i'd say from an alcohol standpointonly a minor step up from kool aid.  we tried the pizza which was really good.  it had great buffalo mozzarella, some fresh basil, and a very thin crispy crust.  the upstairs deck had a decent amount of seating with a few cabanas which provided for some privacy.  unfortunately, they only had a limited bar with a couple of wine and spirits options and no martinis??  the staff was very pleasant and i didn't wait for a drink all night and the food was delivered promptly, which is saying a lot because there was 10 of us.  the onion rings were pretty good, they were the straw type onion rings, not the big thick kind that i like and were served with a spicy ketchup.  the lobster mac was delicious with plenty big pieces of lobster not tiny indistinguishable chunks.  this was a very heavy dish and came in a big first course portion.  the wings had great seasoning, some type of caribbean style i'd guess.  however, they were very small with little meat on them.  we also tried a scallop appetizer that was cooked perfectly and big and plump, however the seasoning overpowered the delicate flaver of the sea scallops.  overall this is a perfectly acceptable not quite fine, but reasonabbly priced finer dining establishment conveniently located with a great deck.  i'll be back.  this place probably deserves 3 1/2 stars.

Vmy co-workers and i had heard about this place and we were anxious to give it a try.  it's a bit of a walk from work (the federal building), so we decided what better weather than a beautiful october day in the 'burgh to take a little stroll over here?  \u000a\u000athe food here is pretty decent, but i'd have to say it was a little pricey.  in all fairness though, they do have interesting selections here--much better than your standard "burgers-to-go" places.  most sandwiches run around $10.00 each.  entrees run somewhat more.  they do have a roasted pizza with mozzerella, basil and roasted tomatoes that sounded tempting.  i tried the "turkey bobby" which is turkey breast, bread stuffing, cranberry sauce & mayo on ciabatta.  \u000a\u000abut this place gets very busy around lunchtime and it seems that they get very overwhelmed here.  it's better to go between 1pm and 2pm for a late lunch like we did.  \u000a\u000athey  serve dinner here and brunch too.  it's probably better to go then.  they do have one brunch item that sounds interesting:  the breakfast sausage corndog.  it comes with 2 eggs, tater tots, and hollandaise sauce.

Vi like kofusion, although i mostly like it for the $1 sushi.  one dollar sushi on monday nights!  don't miss that shit.  the one dollar sushi is as american as it comes (ie fried, filled with cream cheese, and most often not raw) but it is one dollar.  one dollar!  \u000a\u000ai've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but i have had the sake mojito about a million times.  i did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time i have it.  \u000a\u000athe ambience, i believe, is as good as it gets in champaign.  nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.\u000a\u000aservice varies.  on one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be.

Vdefinitely bar first with hookahs coming second, but the bartenders are great and fun to talk to. the prices are a bit steep - as the other reviewer said go from 6-8pm for half-priced hookahs or you could be looking at over $20 for a single one plus a mandatory drink. the flavors are interesting and they always have a featured flavor which was usually great and a fun combination. the atmosphere was nice, with a big wooden bar and local art being showcased. if you're looking for something to do on carson street before going out, definitely stop by and hang out for a little bit.

Vi know, i know i'm somewhat of a hypocrite, don't smoke cigarettes but i will smoke a hookah (once, twice a year maybe) with that being said \u000ai have always enjoyed myself at hkahn, they have a vast variety of flavored tobacco and endless alternatives to add to the base. the establishment is very cozy and the food is quite good, they also have a decent beer selection (lancaster strawberry wheat on tap!), add all of this together and it results in a consuming evening which also adds up to big bucks. we've been known to drop $100+ in one night.

Vi like the urban setting of this store, pittsburgh needs more mall stores outside the mall.  although it seems like i love or hate this store because of the rapid turnover in the selection they carry, i still come back here.\u000a\u000ai know that this is suppose to be a hip place to buy clothes, but the employees here need to realize that doesn't give them a pass to forget they work retail.  pay attention to the customers, i'm in here for a reason.  when you scatter like flies when i approach, that makes me want to leave your store and not buy anything.\u000a\u000ai'll stop back in when i get a chance to browse again, but not on purpose.  i'm not going to make a special trip to come here.

Vsigh why does everyone like antonio's so much?  thin crust = yuck.  toppings = all oil.  ingredient freshness = questionable.  price = (2)*(as expensive as it should be considering the previously implied high oil:crust thickness ratio).  maybe i just enjoy getting sleazed on by the pizza slicers less than the average antonio's patron?\u000a\u000athe only redeeming quality of this place is the outlandish variety of toppings:  tortellini, tortilla chips, blue cheese, steak, bacon, you name it, they will cover it in oil and leer at you while they slice it up for you.

Vthe first time i went here, i ordered a taco salad with beef, and the beef was pink.  not brown on the outside and pink on the inside, pink pink pink.  the second time i went, my friend and i had the same burrito combination platter and both of us got sick the next day.  \u000a\u000ato attain these glorious gastrointestinal bacteria, the wait is usually 45 minutes on weekends in a tiny lobby that smells like a toilet.  one star.

Vit turns out that el toro ii is the favorite restaurant of one of my best friends, so i started to go there alot recently, and it has grown on me exponentially.  the service is always amazing:  the food comes out in like 5 minutes piping hot and exactly as ordered whether the party has 2 people in it or 15.  \u000a\u000ai think i have also gotten a handle on what i like to order here too:  mango margarita (frozen) and three cheese enchiladas.

Vi had heard that jim gould's kitchen and waitstaff were slow and food was overpriced, so i went in expecting to sit around at my table for 2 hours waiting for a flavorless $30 steak.  instead, my waterglass was never empty while i was able to have a fluent conversation with my guests without feeling put upon by our waitress, and my $15 pasta dish tasted like exactly that.  \u000a\u000athe menu is on the expensive side for resaurants in champaign, but let's face facts for a moment and remember that if we want to eat rack of lamb with dried fruit compote, it's going to cost more than $6.00. \u000a\u000ai got a little over-design whiplash from the interior, because 90% of it is this upscale steakhouse vibe but then they have a mondo tacky hunting lodge shale fireplace up against one wall ugly-ing the dining space up like the ugly elephant in the otherwise tastefully appointed room.  same problem in the bar; it has nice white leather couches and a huge wine cellar but then big neon amstel signs up in the windows.  \u000a\u000aif i can convince my friends that i had a good time here over the tidal wave of bad press this place gets, i'll definitely go back.

Vphipps conservatory is another one of the many outstanding cultural amenities in pittsburgh.  i wonder if my fellow natives realize the wealth of culture this city has.\u000a\u000aanyway, i took a week's worth of annual leave from work and decided to make the must of our cultural institutions.  so i asked my friend marla, a stay-at-home mom if she'd like to join me here for a day.  marla practically dialed her mother to ask her to babysit even before i was done talking to her!\u000a\u000aone thing i like is that if you only have a little bit of time, you can visit the sustainable perennial gardens, right around the dome of the phipps.  i believe that you can visit this part for free.  but the sustainable perennial gardens shows you how you can plant flowers and plants that require little water, fertilizer, and pesticides.\u000a\u000ait would be too hard for me to list all of the rooms that phipps has.  i guess my favorite is the fern room, which has a lot of prehistoric plants and tree ferns, many of which have been around since the time of the dinosaurs.  i also enjoy the tropical fruit spice room and the tropical forest conservatory.  it is in these rooms that we are reminded of one of the reasons that the rainforests are so so important to us.  not only is the biodiversity so great, but we get so many of our fruits and spices from them.  take a moment to deeply inhale this fragrant room!  we also get so many medicines from the rainforest and this place has a research lab and a "healer's hut".\u000a\u000amarla's favorite exhibits are the desert room and the japanese courtyard garden.  i can see her point.  japanese gardens are intended to be places of tranquility.  \u000a\u000athe phipps also has a huge outdoor garden and i'm glad that we had the nice weather last week.  it gave us one last chance to walk through the walkways and the beautiful fountains before they're closed for the winter.\u000a\u000aoh, and we saw this guest speaker http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7ixe95czoe  i'm just kidding!  \u000a\u000abut seriously, the phipps can be a wonderful, colorful, and relaxing way to spend the day.  even if you don't have a "green thumb", you'll find something to like here!

Vthis place exudes cheer in an understated way.\u000a\u000aif you're in pittsburgh for a weekend or longer, this should be one of the places to visit.  it's rarely crowded, it's inexpensive, and every room in the building is an awesome collection of plants.  flowers, cactus, palm trees, orchids, with the seasonal butterfly room off to the side, and a great display around christmastime.\u000a\u000acomparing it to botanical gardens in larger cities, it's bigger than the one in washington, dc if that matters to ya.  reading the reviews, it never even occurred to me that not all cities have one of these.  hunh.

Vafter a morning of seeing the birds over at the aviary, catherine and i headed over to the phipps.  as catherine is from chicago and was visiting me for the weekend, i decided to show her stuff that was uniquely pittsburgh.  besides, visiting both the national aviary and the phipps gave us a sort of "fauna & flora" day.  my only regret is that we didn't get to the phipps until about 2pm.\u000a\u000aright now, they are featuring an exhibit called "frbel glass at phipps" and it will run until january, 2010.  it shows the glass sculpture of internationally famous artist hans godo frbel.  the newly redesigned tropical forest conservatory exhibit is now open too.   we also visited the butterfly forest.  \u000a\u000awe got to visit some of my other favorite rooms here, including the sunken garden, the tropical fruit and spice room, and the victoria room.  then we went outside to the aquatic garden, the japanese courtyard garden (my favorite outdoor exhibit), and botany hall.  we then paused for tea and dessert at the cafe phipps before visiting the huge outdoor garden, where i could spend all afternoon if i had a mind to!\u000a\u000awell after that, since i live in squirrel hill, we took a nice long walk home through schenley park.

Vas i mentioned in my review of cafe phipps, our guys all went off to the pennsylvania trolley museum for its holiday festival.  so we girls (me, my mom, my sister-in-law, and my niece) headed over to the phipps conservatory for brunch and a girls' afternoon out.  while the boys were admiring things with rails, electric motors, and steel wheels, we were having a fine brunch and enjoying botanical and horticultural displays.\u000a\u000awe saw the annual winter flower show featuring snowmen made of white garden flowers, a 24 foot christmas tree in the victoria room, smaller christmas trees lit by led lighting, and poinsetta creations throughout the exhibit.  and the new headwaters of the amazon exhibit shows the ecosystems and cultures of the rainforest.  the exhibit includes waterfalls, and fauna and flora from peru and brazil.  \u000a\u000amakes me glad i'm not allergic to pollen!  \u000a\u000abut we had a terrific females only day out.  and should i tell my husband railfan rick about the garden railroad?  shall i tell him about the many g-scale trains they have operating at once?  or about the world's only n-scale garden railroad running alongside?  nah!

Vthe phipps is a wonderful place to take out of town guests, and it's also a great spot for a wedding.  they have in-house catering as well as a short list of caterers that do an excellent job with the food and the other arrangements.  i have attended lots of weddings in the broderie room, which is an ideal spot for a small wedding (under 50 guests). there are some beautiful chihuly art glass pieces installed throughout the phipps, and they are a nice addition to the exhibits.

Vcertainly one of the best "museums" around pittsburgh. a permanent "collection" of plants as well as rotating exhibits which makes repeat visits interesting. they also have an excellent healthy caf which makes a great spot for lunch. come in the winter and escape from the cold outdoor misery.

Vlast time i was in here it was nick's fat city, that should tell you how long ago. *sad face*  let's take a moment........ok, we can now move on.\u000a\u000athis place has retained a lot of it's uniqueness factor, which i appreciate.  i love the levels they have here and the maze like walkways to get from one place to the next.  makes for a night where you have to ask if you were really in here, or if you were dreaming.  if dancing is your thing, stay downstairs and dance on the dance floor.  if being a spectator is more of your thing, go to the upper levels and watch with delight as you look down on everyone getting down to some of the best dance beats you will find in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000abars appear to stretch along the whole wall which is nice.  ample room to sidle up to the bar and wait for your drink.  speaking of drinks, the bartenders are close to magicians.  slinging drinks as fast as they can, even if a majority of them seem to be on autopilot (smile some people).  however, the servers were very nice, polite enough to stop and answer a question i had even though she was on a mission to get the order fulfilled.  \u000a\u000ai may have ended up upstairs as a spectator in the beginning, but after about a half hour in here i made my way down to the dance floor.  once on the dance floor i left myself go and enjoy the music.  everyone laughing and smiling as they were feeling the music.\u000a\u000ai think diesel has me hooked and has shown me that there is still a good place in pittsburgh that plays dance music.  i will be back, oh yes.

Vcold stone is definitely a chain with all of the good and bad aspects which go along with being a chain, but they do have decent quality ice cream with decent quality mix-ins. true, the ice cream is a bit expensive, but this isn't a bad place to go. there are some tables inside where you can sit and enjoy your highly sugared treat.\u000a\u000afor something with a bit more local flair, try "oh yeah!"  in shadyside.

Vmy husband rick wanted ice cream last night after dinner.  so we took a walk over here.  i've avoided this place.  see, to me there's something about places whose names end in "...ery".  "...ery"= $$$!  honestly, what can you get here that you can't get at baskin robbins or, even better, bruster's for a whole lot less $$$?  or as ryan p suggests, try "oh yeah!" in shadyside (but i haven't been there in awhile).\u000a\u000athe other thing i hate about places like cold stone creamery is that the portions have gotten insanely huge.  i have type-1 diabetes, and while i can eat ice cream (and modify my insulin and carb intake), the sizes here are just carb bombs!  i only go to places like this if i can share with someone.  \u000a\u000ato its credit, cold stone creamery does list "healthier" options http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/icecream/healthy_indulgences.html while i think the ice cream here is okay, you can get just as good for less $$ elsewhere.

Vi'm surprised this place has such a low rating. i've been here three times this summer and i love the ice cream and the service. i've brought my family here and they love it too, even though they say the portions are too much. i've come here with groupons plus coldstone gives out coupons for your next visit (ex: $1 off sundaes, free waffle cones).

Vi went here with my co-workers today as we were celebrating someone's birthday (not mine).  i agree with daniel's review, the decor here is striking and it is an impressive place to walk into.  the service here is very good too as we were seated right away and our waitress was prompt.\u000a\u000abut the food here just seems a little underwhelming here, especially for the price.  there's nothing particularly wrong with it.  it does seem to be a bit pricier than other downtown restaurants.  the pasta here looked tempting, as did the "godfather" sandwich.  but i was in the mood for a good ol' fashioned burger, so i had the "gourmet deluxe cheeseburger" with sharp, white cheddar cheese on it.  the burger was delicious, but "gourmet" often means "huge" and i ended up sharing my fries with someone.\u000a\u000aso anyways, this seems more like a place to go to on a special occasion versus an everyday place.  i stil recommend it, though.

Vi take it back, guido's is no longer my favorite bar in champaign.  with the renovations and the new room full of beautiful gothic wooden booths, read leather couches, totally hot lounge chairs, and, importantly, twice the capacity, blind pig is now officially the best place in champaign for graduate students to hang out and bitch about their thesis research.  the beers!  oh, the beers!    so much guiness and stella on tap!  and the bartenders will be all nice and cool when they serve it to you!\u000a\u000ablind pig has somehow always managed to avoid having huge quantities of skanks and guys in striped, button down shirts, and even the golden oldies that frequent the place have a kind of hippie cool.  \u000a\u000ai might have even gone to blind pig when i lived in boston.  it's that good.

Vi gotta love the east liberty section of pittsburgh.  part 'hood, part not, like on center avenue and baum boulevard.  so on the border of east liberty and shadyside sits trader joe's.  \u000a\u000ai'll admit to never having tried trader joe's before today.  my husband rick and i generally shop in the strip distrcit for meats and produce and at giant eagle for everything else.  but we wanted to try something different today.  we found that trader joe's was far less pretentious and somewhat cheaper than whole foods.\u000a\u000atrader joe's does sell a lot of different foods from all over, but one thing i like is that they sell a lot of locally-sourced foods too.  we found a lot of local meats and fruits and vegetables, just like we would have in the strip district.

Vtrader joe's is excellent.  they are a money suck in the same way that target is - i go in thinking "i need a bag of onions and those peanut butter dog biscuits and that's it", and i somehow spent $60 and come out with 4 huge bags of everything under the sun.  everything just looks so good.  the packaging is pretty, the ethnic foods are all intriguing, and there are so many things you just have to have.\u000a\u000ai will admit that the produce section is not great, since almost everything is packaged in bulk.  but trader joe's produce (specifically the onions and potatoes) seem to stay good a lot longer than giant eagle's.  \u000a\u000aand a lot of things are cheaper here than giant eagle - milk, the indian boil-in-a-bag lunches (love those), the aforementioned dog biscuits (rosa loves those), tofu, olive oil.  there are also a lot of dishes you won't find at giant eagle, especially in the frozen foods section.  trader joe's offers a ton of vegetarian convenience foods, something that giant eagle is lacking.  burritos, single servings of eggplant parmesan, vegetable biryani, spanikopita... it's all here, along with soy ice cream and mochi and $7 tiramisu.  i'm pretty sure olive garden charges $5 per slice of tiramisu; come here and get a whole cake for $7!\u000a\u000aand there are always new products coming - just look at the fearless flyer. it's funny and makes you want to buy everything advertised in it.\u000a\u000athe staff is friendly, the prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of the merchandise, the store is never too full and they give away free samples.  what's not to love?

Vfor folks from other cities, it's like a normal trader joe's, except with easy parking, lightning fast checkout times, and a healthy crowd in the store instead of being painfully jam-packed.\u000a\u000afor folks from pittsburgh, it's a grocery store that only sells one brand of generics; that brand is trader joe's.  they don't stock everything, as some things, they couldn't get generically relabeled to their store brand.  they do stock a really wide array of out of the ordinary stuff, though.\u000a\u000athe most awesome selection of dried fruit/nuts/etc anywhere, and also at the best price.  great selection of frozen fish and vegetables, also at a great price.  best price on cut flowers in the city.  tasty hummus.  mediocre tabouleh.\u000a\u000athey're so-so on produce, and know it.  i'm alright with that, as they carry the basics, and this is my store for dry/frozen goods, mostly.

Vtrader joe is my boyfriend.  don't tell my other boyfriend.  it started out as a small harmless affair, but now i visit tj a few times a week, coming home from work late.  my boyfriend doesn't even need to ask "where have you been?"  the paper bags in my hands, bulging with deliciousness, give me away every time.\u000a\u000ai see no reason why people hate on trader joe's.  i mean - "waaah, less selection than a real grocery store...." - duh, people.  this is not a giant eagle (thank god.)  this is not to meant to have every single thing ever.  but - nearly every single thing they do have is incredible, delicious, well-priced, and made from natural ingredients.  i do as much of my shopping here as possible - and if you really look, you can find almost anything you need.\u000a\u000ai've hardly had something here i didn't love.  holy crap, where do i begin.  mango sorbet, their holiday peppermint/cookies and cream ice cream, plantain chips, peanut butter filled pretzels, inexpensive dried fruit/nuts (way cheaper than any other store), totally affordable gourmet cheese, joe's os, 99 cent pasta, amazing frozen entrees, strawberry licorice, cheap produce (yes, small selection, but it is inexpensive so it all works out), surprisingly good meat selection, ginger beer, raspberry fruit spread, great prices on staples (diced tomatoes, coconut milk, flour, sugar), flavorful pasta sauce, tasty teas (jasmine green is my favorite), and a million other delicious things.\u000a\u000ai want to eat the whole store.  except the pet food.\u000a\u000ait is tragic that pa's idiotic liquor laws don't allow this tjs to sell wine and beer.  you do not know what you're missing.  the wine section at my old tj's in chicago was the absolute bomb.  bottles under $10 as far as the eye can see.  if pa got it's act together, this trader joe's could achieve an even higher level of perfection.\u000a\u000athe lines aren't even that long.  seriously people - go to a tj's in a big city like chicago - that's a bad line.  this store moves pretty swiftly.  employees are friendly (dare i say perky) and always helpful - maybe because tj's pays them a very high wage (relative to other grocery store employees) and provides benefits.  it's a great business to support.\u000a\u000atj's forever, i will always love you.  no other store can compare.

Vtrader joe's is my favorite place to shop in pittsburgh.  the prices are reasonable, the quality is excellent, and there's all kinds of great products that are unique and marvelous.\u000a\u000amy biggest complaint is that sometimes i will really enjoy one of their products, and then it gets discontinued.

Vthis is one of those places that i enjoy, but always forget about.  \u000a\u000ai enjoy the items on the shelves and always end up coming out with more than i went in for.  although i miss the lemonade they have.\u000a\u000awhy i can't give this place more than three stars, the obstacle course of a parking lot.  i'm serious.  get out of your car and then stretch.  then do your parkour over to the entrance.

Vthis is another one of those places in which i'd never been to even though i live practically right around the corner.  i don't drink and sports bars just aren't my thing.  but my girl posse and i were going to a movie at the adajacent manor theatre and my friend marla called me to say she was running late.  so since we didn't have time to eat anywhere else, we stopped here.\u000a\u000ai'm glad i did though.  i was in the mood for a good burger and you really can't go wrong ordering one in a place like this.  the pittsburgher here is a pound-o-beef on a bun.  no thanks!  i could feel my arteries slamming shut with that one.  i opted for the silky burger with swiss cheese and raw onions.  gotta have raw onions on my burger!  and the great thing is you can rationalize ordering a burger here by ordering a broccoli salad with it.  right!  my burger was fantastic.\u000a\u000aso this seems like a good sports bar if you're into that sort of thing.  but it's also a good choice if you want a bite before or after a movie.

Vi've been to a few happy hours here, and it's a really solid place to get a drink with friends.  i can't recall all their happy hour deals - we've usually gone on friday and i think their special on that day is pretty minor (like 50 cents off beer or something), but they have better deals on other weekdays.\u000a\u000awe can always get a table at happy hour time.  the atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  affordable food, which i haven't found to be terribly special, but it's fine as bar food goes.  we've had various appetizers (onion rings, chicken fingers, nachos) - the nachos are huge, as i recall - even our group of four had trouble finishing them.  i'm happy to live just down the street from silky's, and i'd always be up for a return visit for a drink with friends, or to watch a game.

Vthree and a half stars.  i'm not much into sports bars, but silky's is a good place to stop at before or after a movie.  and my mom and i did just that, stopping in for a quick dinner before going to see "the artist" at the nearby manor.  \u000a\u000amom ordered the fandango chicken salad.  kind of a shame that the nearby manor isn't on fandango.com but that's another story.  me, i went for the cuban chicken sandwich-- chicken breast, ham, pickles, mustard and swiss cheese on foccacia bread!  pretty good!

Vthis place is great.  it is not "authentic" by any stretch of the imagination, nor is it classy, tastefully appointed, large, or well-ventilated, but goddamn if my orange chicken pellets weren't the perfect size, the perfect amount of deep fried, and the perfect amount of orange glazed.  \u000a\u000athe cleanliness was very high for a chinese lunch counter in a strip mall, and the line cooks were screaming at each other in chinese over the sound of szechuan beef steaming and sizzling on the wok just as they should be.\u000a\u000ai ordered take out from the counter, and in the future i think i will call ahead as i had to wait about 20 minutes.  it was crazy crowded in there at the dinner hour, people were coming in to pick up their take out every single minute.

Vi have been to this location everytime i'm in vegas. always great food and service. the lines can be crazy on the weekends though! one of the cheapest places to eat vegas imho. the portions are so big you can share. if you sit on the patio you'll have a front row seat to the show above the aquarium. \u000a\u000asome of my favorite appetizers are the roadside sliders, southern fried chicken sliders and the firecracker salmon. \u000a\u000amy favorite specialties are the ranch house burger, steak diane and the grilled shrimp & bacon club. \u000a\u000amy favorite cheesecake is the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake. it is absolutely amazing!  \u000a\u000amy favorite drinks are the tropical smoothie and the frozen iced mango.\u000a\u000athey didn't offer a kid's menu in the past but now do. it's for kids 10 and under and includes a drink (choice of a soft drink, milk, apple juice or lemonade) \u000a\u000athis is what is offered:\u000a\u000aroadside sliders \u000afried chicken sliders \u000amini corn dogs \u000apasta with butter & parmesan cheese \u000awith marinara sauce \u000awith meat sauce \u000awith alfredo sauce  \u000akids quesadilla \u000awith chicken  \u000amac & cheese \u000achicken strips w/ fries \u000acheese or pepperoni pizza  \u000agrilled cheese with fries \u000agrilled chicken breast with potatoes and a vegetable  \u000a\u000adesserts are: \u000aice cream  \u000amini hot fudge sundae  \u000akid's strawberries\u000a\u000ainsider tip: they also offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread.

Vi stopped in this place yesterday on a rainy saturday afternoon with matt and rob.  i always forget about this place, which is a shame because it's worth a visit especially to find a decent bar with good plasmas' and always a seat at the bar.  it's located across from starbucks on e. carson st.  it's a converted bank that has tall ceilings, private room downstairs and plenty of seating and a marble bar on the main floor.  the vault still exists in this converted bank, however now it's a handicapped restroom.  the regular restrooms are in the basement, which is a bit inconvenient.  the restrooms only had the hot air machines and no papertowels.  i don't know anyone who prefers this option.  i started with the chili.  the bartender, brian said he made it himself.  it was very good with lots of flavor, fresh seasonings, big chunks of beef and well cooked kidney beans.  my only complaint is that it was served only luke warm.  i also ordered the steak quesadilla.  it was a healthy portion of only mildly flavorful steak umm type meat and plenty of cheese.  it was a little below average, but it's not like i'm at an authentic tex mex place.  rob ordered the "fried bologna" sandwich, which i give kudos to this place for just having such an item on the menu.  i tried it and was pretty impressed.  it was my first fried bologna sandwich.  they served it with a fried egg and a few juicy slices of tomatoes.  matt ordered the chicken fingers and fries.  the chicken fingers were what you'd expect, but the fries were well above average i'd guess cut fresh daily and double fried.  my favorite aspect of my time spent here yesterday was one of the better top shelf long island iced teas i've had in this city.  brian is a true pro and made a strong and delicious cocktail.  the prices are fair here and if you are looking for an alternative to the 45 min. typical wait that you'll have at fatheads you could do a lot worse than this place.

Vthe beckman cafe is notable among university of illinois lunch counters --and probably lunch counters the world over-- for having the friendliest lunch ladies around.\u000a\u000agreek salad day is a winner:  sometimes it's all that gets me through my 65 hour long grad student work week.

Vthis is a good place to take your parents or to have a business event.  the location is right in the city (mellon center).  the bar is relatively small with most seating in old leather chairs and some table tops.  the decor is definitely old school with the wallpaper being golfers in traditional garb in a picturesque (sp?), 1920's scene with girls golfing in dresses.  the rest of the restaurant is dark wood, leather, and white tops.  the servers are dressed in tuxes or suits and in my experience are true professionals.  i have a couple business dinner parties here a year and have always been extremely pleased.  i've never come here on a date and i suggest if you are under 50 there are much better date spots to take your partner.  however, for all its old school charm the menu can be occassionally surprisingly nuanced and fresh.  my favorite is to have the wine dinners here.  the chef truly is talented and always comes up with something surprising and delicious.  also, props need to be paid to kevin joyce for fighting this damn county drink tax.  he also serves some of the best, reasonably priced wine in the city and has been for decades.  i didn't do the wine tasting dinner last night, but instead went a more traditional route offering multiple entree choices.  the dinner starts with either a carlton salad or soup of the day.  the carlton salad looked awesome, romaine, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, hard boiled egg and creamy dressing (definitely not for the dieter).  the soup i had last night was the three food groups, those being cheese, bacon, and potatoes.  the soup was obviously heavy, but i found way too salty and in general not a good choice for me.  it sat in my stomach like a sock full of nickels.  many ordered the seafood wellington, which i've had before and it's another non-dieter dish comprising of pastry, sole, lobster, crab and cheese.  this dish is definitely rich and tasty.  i tried the prime rib, which was about an average tasting non- "prime" prime rib with plenty of marbeling and cooked well enough.  however, i've had just as good prime rib if not better at outback.  the most delicious presentation goes to the veal portabello which is sauteed veal with capers adn mushrooms, whipped potatoes and a nice tomato beurre blanc.  sadly, i didn't get a chance to try this.  i was told it was delicious.  the desserts were all good and most likely prepared in house.  i tried the award winning chocolate cheesecake which was very good.  i only wish they had some lighter dessert options like berries.  all in all a great restaurant for the older crowd or business events.  the servers, especially faye are awesome.  last night faye literally chased me down the parking garage to give me my leftovers.  the food deserves 3 stars, the servers 4 stars, and the wine prices and kevins anti tax efforts 5 stars.  this is a true pittsburgh institution.

Vi feel like we have reached a tipping point where, in calling the brillobox a hipster hotspot, you are either a hipster yourself, or a parrot. \u000a\u000atrue: a lot of the dj dance parties are stocked with the over-styled, over-funded, pretentious, pittsburgh arty elite. it's "a little bit of nyc in pittsburgh," and we all sort of cringe when we think of that description ( i hope!). if you love crazy dance parties and stylish posturing, stop by on any given fri or sat. \u000a\u000aalso true: the prices are good. the beer selection is acceptable. i may be biased because i like the magic hat brewery and i seem to remember they always have 1 or 2 of those sweet numbers on draft, but the taps are clean regardless. the cocktails are strong, and they dial up beverages inspired by tang on the regular. \u000a\u000athe food is decent, though. i heard the menu was going all veggie, which wouldn't be a stretch for their kitchen. every time i have eaten here, it has been delicious, flavorful, and tasted fresh & local. go earlier to avoid the crowds. go on a sunday night for their $5 "starving artist" dinner (vegetarian till the food runs out) and stay for some quality brews and youtube karaoke. \u000a\u000aquiz night is wildly popular. take some friends, form a team, prove your mental prowess. the happy hour specials are decent. the atmosphere is well-suited for the "artistic graduate student set." good for a meet-up with old pals. not a great spot to take your folks, but then, i have been trying not to go to bars with my parents lately... \u000a\u000aone small thing: if you go on a quiet night, you can sometimes play patsy cline on the juke box. this is the surest way for a bar to win my heart.

Vthe hipster bar.  dancefloor upstairs, bar with food downstairs.  non-smoking now, so the smoking section is outside/out-front.  the dancefloor doesn't seem to get going until late, and can fill up pretty quickly for popular stuff.  \u000a\u000athe food was actually pretty tasty, and accomplishes what it sets out to do; it's an interesting and well done vegetarian fare.  it's not an out-of-the-park dining experience; the food probably wouldn't stand alone if this were a restaurant.  that said, i order the food every time i'm there, and leave a little happier than when i walked in.\u000a\u000athey started stocking hendricks gin, which is a winner in my book.

Vnice-looking mellow bar with odd videos playing on projector screens. i wouldn't go as far as call it the hipster bar of pittsburgh but it does draw a crowd of funny-dressed people who like to talk about their latest art piece they made while going through a breakup with yet another boyfriend. drinks are okay, the downstairs bar gets packed fast and is small, good luck finding a place to stand without getting constantly bumped. and i have not ventured upstairs.

Vi've been here several times to see live music, and although amazingly loud, it's a good venue. music takes place upstairs, but downstairs the bar is a little quieter and has a pretty large selection of beer including local favorites like big hop from the east end brewing company. the food here is actually awesome - nice appetizers, and locally raised, hormone free meats. the chicken sandwich with bacon and side salad was excellent. a fair number of veggie options as well. \u000a\u000abrillobox is a non-smoking venue which raises it's appeal for me!

Vbrillobox is many different things. on any given night it can be a bar, a restaurant, a dance club, a venue, a movie theater, or just a hipster-watching mecca. some nights, maybe most nights, it is all of these at once. \u000a\u000athe bar/restaurant portion of brillobox offers mostly standard fare for this type of bar in the area. a decent draft beer selection that changes regularly at ok($6ish) prices, a food menu of slightly upscale pub grub(french fries? sorry, we only have 'pomme frites') - appetizers in the $6-10 range, entrees in the $9-14 range, and a large liquor selection with some cool additions at times(can't wait to see another vessel of pineapple infused tequila grace the shelves). to me the bartenders are friendly in general, as long as you don't waste their time, and they'll generally pour a stronger drink. the downside is that the best i can say about the food is that it is inconsistent - sometimes wonderful and sometimes bland. also, the bar can get packed at times so don't always expect to get a seat. at a certain point in the night(8 or earlier), they card everyone at the door, so minors be aware.\u000a\u000aevery wednesday they have a trivia night around 9pm that features a wide range of questions, including a video round and a name-that-song round. the trivia questions are usually well thought out - difficult, but not impossible with a diverse group(6 or less), and third through first competes for a free appetizer, a $10 gift card, and a $25 gift card, respectively. ties are settled by arm wrestling.\u000a\u000aevery sunday at 6pm they have a $6 vegetarian dinner special that goes 'until they run out'. i have yet to attend this, but it is high on my list of to-dos. they also serve a brunch on saturday and sunday which i have not been to, and many other events throughout the week.\u000a\u000athe venue/dance club portion of the brillobox is upstairs and depending on the night usually opens around 8 or 9, and there is usually a cover to get in. there is no seating up here save for one vinyl booth, and table space is limited, so get there early if you need either one of those things. the upstairs is small, narrow, and loud, and tends to get packed, so if you aren't looking for a party, then don't bother coming up and paying the cover just to be miserable. on the bright side, if that is your kind of thing, then a dance party night is definitely a place to be. shows here tend to be decent, and are always 21+. there is also a smaller bar up here.\u000a\u000athe crowd is filled with the hipsters of bloomfield, lawrenceville and the garfield arts district, but i've never noticed much elitism among their ranks.  the music mostly caters to them - sometimes it has substance, sometimes it doesn't. if it's a dance party, you can't and shouldn't, ask for much.\u000a\u000ain general, brillobox offers a pretty fun time for almost any kind of night you're looking for

Vbrillobox is like kelly's, taken to the extreme. whereas kelly's is hipster, in the "let's drink good beer and include everyone and play indie music" sense, brillobox is "let's drink good beer and play music no one's ever heard of." whereas kelly's has normal mac and cheese, brillobox makes theirs with nacho cheese.\u000a\u000abrillobox is admittedly over the top, but i love it. it's a small, intimiate atmosphere, and the music is great. trivia is really the best reason to come though - it's hard, and the teams get really into it. finally, drink prices are reasonable, and they will actually come to your table (if you can snag one) to bring you your food.

Vlet us talk about the food and drink at this place.  everyone seems to have covered the aesthetic aspect of this place, so i really shouldn't even waste any time on that in this review.\u000a\u000ai was hungry, i mean really hungry and just decided to check my yelp app for nearby places and brillo popped up.  scanned their menu and decided this was were i was going to satisfy that hunger in me.  the menu is short but they seem to cover a fair amount of area when it comes to quick bites.  i was going back and forth between the gourmet grilled cheese and the brilloburger.  of course, being the burger fan i am i opted for the brilloburger.  i was quite excited because you got to pick the cheese you wanted on it (at no extra cost).  you also get the option to have either potato chips or a mixed green salad, i opted for the mixed green salad.\u000a\u000awhen the burger came out, my jaw dropped.  good thing it did, because is was huge.  so huge it was necessary to cut it in half to devour it.  i swear they make their own buns there, if not they get them locally and fresh daily.  they lightly toast the bun before loading it with that amazing patty of beef.  the burger had to have been a half pounder, juicy and thick (cooked to order).  lettuce, tomato and red onions top it.  i opted for the smoked gouda cheese which gave it that extra flavor of goodness.  thank god for the extra napkins supplied, they were definitely needed.  i'm sure i wasn't a pretty sight eating this monster, but it tasted so good that afterward i swear i should have taken a shower.\u000a\u000athe mixed green salad was an amazing side.  carrot shavings and an amazing balsamic dressing made in house.  \u000a\u000anow, for the drinks, they have an amazing mix of drafts and big bottled beer (read that as higher alcohol content).  what i really appreciate about this place is rather than describe to you what the flavor of a beer is they have on draft, they give you a sample and you can make that decision by yourself.  i selected the brooklyn pale ale and after a nice sample, proceeded to order two more drafts.\u000a\u000anow, the staff were amazing.  a nice compliment to such an awesome place.  they were attentive to our every need.  checked on us frequently.  and the best part was that it didn't matter who started our order, whenever someone came around, they made sure we were taken care of.\u000a\u000adefinitely a return visit in the near future from me.

Vsame average food tourist trap as all the other hard rocks i've been to. \u000a\u000athis place is really, really small. they do make really good drinks though. what really pissed me off was every time i went to the bar to get a drink i kept getting carded. i know i look young, but damn! i am over thirty! \u000a\u000awhat this place has going for it is location and that's about it. \u000a\u000ago to the melting pot instead, you'll be much happier!

Vi go here often and the bartenders are really good.  i'm not sure if it's because i'm a regular, but i find the wait staff here excellent.  it's a pretty good location with valet parking and a fun spot "seviche" across the street which has the same owner.  it's never too crowded and they have plenty of comfy seating with couches and chairs not just barstools.  the wine selection is great, but overpriced.  i can pay $33 for a bottle of cakebread chardonnay at the liquor store, but they charge $150 here.  a 5x multiple is just too much and i think a little greedy.  they also don't have guiness on tap which i believe every bar should have.  i was there last night and was particularly disappointed with the food.  that's why i decided to write a review.  again, overall this is a pretty good place usually.  i think they need to have more features with  respect to the menu.  the menu doesn't seem to change much to me and i find it a bit boring, but again i go here often so i've tried many of the options.  last night i had this pork dish that was supposed to be a pork chop and also a side of "pork belly".  the chop wasn't that good. i've had bettter quality at tg mcfunsters... for god's sake and the pork belly wasn't really pork belly which is supposed to be oozing with flavor and texture.  a friend had the calamari, which was cold and not that good.  it was better after the staff heated it up.  another friend had the menu item where you can pick one, two, or three proteins to pair with sides.  he had the shrimp tempura which i tried and it was pretty good.  on other visits i've had the "kobe" hamburger.  i'm not sure if it's kobe beef, but it's a pretty good burger.  i also really like the avocado and crab appetizer.  this is probably my favorite menu item.  they have a nice cheese board, but on two occassions when i ordered the cheese was ice cold when it should have been room temperature.  overall a fun time, but i would suggest just going there for a few drinks and saving your appetite for some of the other downtown restaurants like nine on nine a block down the street.

Vi only came here for their happy hour, but it was easily the most awesome happy hour i have ever attended.  thus the five stars.  \u000a\u000aparking is tricky (they have valet, but i couldn't find a place to pull in because lots of other cars were doing the same thing), so i just parked in the garage on ninth a block away.  i met up with some girlfriends in the wine bar area, where it was....ladies night.\u000a\u000ayes, tuesday is ladies night here at sonoma grille, and thus every woman gets a first drink for free.  free.  anything.  well, anything under $8, but our server said if we wanted something that was normally over $8, he'd just work it out for us.  i asked for something fruity and feminine and got an unidentified ruby red cocktail that was delicious and quickly consumed.\u000a\u000awithin 90 minutes, there were about 10 of us girls there, and our server and a manager were practically falling over themselves to help us.  they were attentive, charming, and even a little flirtatious, which is always fun at a happy hour. we kept ordering drinks (during happy hour, some beers are $3, some wines are $4, and some cocktails are $5) and food ($5 sushi rolls and select tapas).  my spicy tuna roll was a good deal for $5, simple and fresh.  the wines were poured generously and at perfect temperature.\u000a\u000awhen we got our bill, we had clearly been given a few more free drinks than we deserved (not sure if it was an accident, or generosity), but the bill came to $70 for 10 girls, each of whom had at least one drink, sometimes two, sometimes three (but the first one was free!) and several sushi rolls.  i don't understand how it happened, but that server got a very generous tip, and sonoma grille got a rave review from me!  \u000a\u000athe atmosphere is classy, with lots of people dressed up and men in suits and ties, so you have to be in the mood for that kind of crowd.  but we were treated like queens, and i would be happy to come back any time - especially on tuesdays!

Vcame here for a quick lunch with my mom, when we were both attending a conference on bipolar disorder at the westin down the street.  i think the restaurant did not expect a whole bunch of conference attendees to randomly crash their lunch hour.  service was slow, but our server was basically like "sorry, all these people came at once, i had no idea, we're doing the best we can."  i believe him.  i doubt their lunch service is normally bad or slow at all.  we had a lovely table on the sidewalk, in the shade, so i was happy to wait a little while.  he also brought the check out with our entrees, since he knew we were in a hurry, so that was helpful.\u000a\u000ai had the fish tacos, which i really enjoyed.  i was offered a side of "fries or fruit" and i picked fruit, which was the usual fruit-cup assortment of melons, pineapple, and grapes.  it was tasty and fresh but i would've liked more - like if you'd get a whole plateful of fries, can't you get a plateful of fruit?  but the tacos were really good - "fresh seasonal fish" as written on the menu - it was salmon and some tasty white fish on this occasion - with slaw, crema, and pico de gallo.  most of the ingredients were locally sourced, according to the menu, and you could taste the freshness.  big ups to the handmade tortillas - i suspect reyna's made them - they were fantastic.  they did come with this really weird side of undressed greens -  maybe they were supposed to go in the tacos? - but there were a ton of them and i had no idea what to do with them.  server brought me a little bowl of vinaigrette, at my request, so then they were turned into a nice salad.\u000a\u000agreat happy hour, and fresh, well-executed food.  great people watching too!  lunch prices are very reasonable.

Vabsolutely delicious.  who knew that there could be hip, locally(ish) sourced dining in pittsburgh?\u000a\u000awas a little strange to pull up to a nice restaurant on an otherwise industrial looking road, but once inside, you could never tell you weren't in san francisco or some other, more hip city.  nice ambiance, and good acoustics (meaning not having to shout).  we sat down and got some tasty fresh baked bread.  amuse of goat cheese with some sort of berry smear.  we both had the three greens salad, which was nice.  not outstanding, but heck, it was a good salad.  but the entrees were fantastic.  i had the lamb, and it was delicious.  a little on the salty side, but then again, my cravings are for salt, and not sugar, so that was ok by me.  my dining companion had the bass, and said it was quite good.\u000a\u000afinished off with the coffee and doughnuts, which was their version of coffee creme brulee with beignets.  very nice finish to a very nice meal.  overall, great service, great food, and great ambiance.

Vthis is my favorite big burritto joint.  i've been here several times and never been disappointed.  the valet parking is  helpful, however should be complimentary given the cost of the place.  the interior is gorgeous with an open kitchen, great bar area, tall ceilings and private area upstairs.  the wine selection is better than most and overpriced as is the standard.  the service is as good as any other place in the city from the host to the server to  the bartender.  dinner starts with an amouse bouche (sp?), which last night was some type of parmesan crisp with a pea mash on top (not that good really and an odd grainy texture).  then they have a great assortment of bread they make in house.  we started last night with  a lamb taco which was perfectly cooked seasoned tender lamb on a corn tortilla with a nice sauce.  i ordered the filet, which was a prime cut filet cooked perfectly served with  a mushroom black truffle bread pudding (the bread pudding was quite heavy and except for the mushrooms pretty bland).  it's also accompanied with root vegetables in a wine reduction.  my friend ordered the seafood tasting, which we shared.  it was a small piece of salmon cooked well and seasoned nicely with  two shrimp with the head on.  the shrimp was amazing.  it was delicate and had a great flavor, tasted like they pulled them  out of the  water minutes earlier.  the crabcakes were a little below average with too much breading and a little overcooked.  a special shout out to the server tim who was great and a pro.  next time i'll try the chef tasting menu and if a group occassion comes up i hear the chef's table in the kitchen is quite an experience.  all in all this restaurant can stack up in any city.

Vmaybe my expectations for eleven were too high. i do love a lot of big burrito, and with eleven billed as "contemporary american," i thought it would be a runaway heart-stealer. unfortunately, i found the food to be pretentious without any reason to be, boring at best, and occasionally just gross. i'm a vegetarian, so maybe their meat dishes are better. if a restaurat goes so far as to have a veg tasting menu, i'd expect something above average for the veggie diners.the signature drinks seemed exciting on paper, but failed to deliver in person. i do remember the bathroom as luxuriously delightful, though.

Vi came here w/ one of my favorites this past thursday night; after walking out i can declare eleven as one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh.  we made reservations for 7 pm and were promptly seated; most of the crowd seemed to be of an older demographic, the average age in the restaurant was easily at least 20 years older than me.\u000a\u000ai walked in with the intention of ordering their four course tasting menu with the wine pairing, but changed my mind the last second because i really wanted to try their wagyu beef carpaccio.  i ended up ordering their elysian fields farm lamb and she ordered their heritage farms pork (all of the big burrito restaurants push the fact that they use sustainable ingredients, as is evident from the fact that the locations where all proteins are sourced are included in the dish names).\u000a\u000athe carpaccio was as good as expected; would i order it again?  depends on my mood, and who i'm with.  i've realized i have a larger than average-for-an-asian hankering for raw and cured meats.\u000a\u000ai knew if i didn't get their tasting menu i'd be deciding between their lamb and duck dish (my two favorite land-based proteins), but our server told me the lamb was his favorite dish hands down, so i took his word for it and had it medium rare.  i know some people complain about lamb having a "lamb-y" taste, but this lamb was well sourced and well cooked with maximum tenderness and flavor without the off-putting flavor of cheaper cuts of meat.  the roasted root vegetables had just the perfect bite; not too soft which would result in mushiness and not too hard from being undercooked.  the polenta was absolutely delicious and paired perfectly with both the protein and the vegetable.\u000a\u000athe pork was a giant chop served on the bone, cooked to a suggested medium rare.  the taste of well sourced ingredients is especially evident when it comes to protein as animals raised outside the typical inhumane dark and cramped living conditions have a richer flavor with a better mouthfeel.  the sliced sweet potatoes were cooked well but their texture didn't resonate with me as a perfect match with the crunchiness of the apple strips and the meatiness of the pork.  everything else was spot on though.\u000a\u000afor dessert we split their banana cream pie.  the deconstructed pie came with house-made banana graham crackers topped with dulce de leche mousse with a banana brulee on the side.  the graham crackers were a bit crunchier than expected but were perfect to cut the sweetness and creaminess of the mousse.  the banana brulee itself of course was a wonderful textural experience with the caramelized exterior of the banana cutting into the sweetness of the soft fruit.\u000a\u000awhen you do go to eleven, make sure you are in the mindset and mood to eating simple yet elegantly prepared quality food.  food doesn't taste as good when you're distracted and the dishes eleven serves up are worthy of your full attention.

Vsimply put, this was one of the finest luncheon experiences i've ever had.  my suprvisor took me here to lunch as a commendation for my 10 years of service and as a way of thanking me for everything i've done this past year.  "and susan, you will wear business attire?" my boss asked when she invited me.\u000a\u000abelieve me folks, this is not a place you eat at everyday!\u000a\u000athe lunches themselves are multi-course, much like dinners are.  of course, you can skip a course if you like.  my supervisor asked me, "well, susan, shall we start off with a nice cheese course?"  we did and we split an order of  camembert which is pasteurized sheep's & cow's milk.  you can also get oysters, mussels, soup, etc, courses.  we did however order salads.  i remember settling for the three greens salad.\u000a\u000anow when it came to the main course, my supervisor said, "order whatever you want susan."  i could have gone "whoo-hoo" or "tally-ho" and ordered up the most expensive steak they had.  but ya know, a little decorum here.  i didn't want to go overboard on her generosity.  anyway, the chicken sandwich with pesto, mozzerella, and balsamic vinaigrette was out of this world.  my supervisor's crab cake looked wonderful too.\u000a\u000athey also offer a "chef's tasting" selection here for $25.00 and a fine wine course.  my boss said that the wine looked tempting, but we were on company time (and besides, i don't drink anyway).  \u000a\u000athis is simply a fabulous, once-a-year place to have lunch.

Vone of the nicer eateries in pittsburgh, comes at a steep price though. i felt some of our waiters were a bit douchy and pretentious at first. if you look under 25 and somebody from your party wants to order a cocktail, be prepared to show *everyone's* ids. on the good side, they were very good about accommodating our giant party of 16 ( even if it was 6pm on a wednesday night) \u000a\u000abefore bringing out our food, we got these little sandwiches with onions and salmon caviar - tasty! then came our oysters, from long island, served with a nice, spicy pepper sauce and some milder one. for main course, i tried the beef tenderloin, pork chop, and tuna. i ordered the beef medium and it came nicely red on the inside, leaning towards medium-rare which worked fine for me since that's what i usually go with anyway. the fingerling potatoes were a tad undercooked and hard. the pork chop was served on bacon grits, and that was the best part of that dish. the pork chop itself was bland and boring. tuna was alright, nothing special.\u000a\u000afor dessert, i had apricot semifreddo covered with somekindofdarkberry syrup drizzle, it was ok - tasty ice cream.

Vmy boyfriend and i came here for my birthday dinner!  i was drawn in by their swanky website and delicious, fresh-sounding food.\u000a\u000athe valet was only $5, which i thought was amazing compared to the $10 you find in chicago.  we were seated immediately, with a reservation and the hostess asked us what kind of water we wanted.  it was brought out promptly, which was nice - it feels good to at least have something to sip before the server arrives.\u000a\u000aour server was both speedy and knowledgeable.  i was concerned that one of our appetizers and my entree would be too similar in flavor (and thus repetitive/boring), but he told me that this would not be so - both were made of lamb, but different cuts and uniquely prepared.  indeed he was right, and i'm glad i listened to him!\u000a\u000ai began with the pear-secco cocktail: pear vodka, pear nectar, and prosecco.  the drink was elegant and refreshingly not-too-sweet.  it tasted like a fresh pear, and wasn't too sugary or watered down.  i savored it throughout the meal.  our first bites were of oysters - they were about $2 each, so we sprung for 4.  they were served on a bed of ice with two different hot sauce mixes - one more traditional and one specialty housemade.  i preferred the traditional, but actually chose to eat neither with the oyster.  the oysters were fresh and succulent on their own, no sauce required.\u000a\u000afor appetizers, we shared the grilled peaches and the smoked lamb taco.  the lamb taco was absolutely excellent - there was a tortilla buried under smoky, juicy lamb, creamy lentils (in the place of refried beans), and flavorful salsa.  we were nearly licking the plate at the end.  we were both a bit underwhelmed by the grilled peaches - the peaches themselves were nice, as was the goat cheese and berry drizzle, but the "surryano" ham didn't do it for us.  and that's not a typo, it really is surryano ham - never heard of it.  it was too....smoky, perhaps?  it had a dusky flavor that was unappealing to us both, which greatly affected the enjoyment of the overall dish.  but to be fair, when you separate the dish into its components, most of them were excellent.\u000a\u000afor my entree, i had the elysian fields farm lamb, which the server highly recommended.  it was truly excellent - juicy, luscious, and would convert someone in an instant who claims not to like lamb.  the accompanying polenta was wonderfully creamy.  my boyfriend got the heritage farms chicken which he enjoyed very much - i took a bite and found it to be juicy!\u000a\u000ano dessert, since i had a cake waiting for me at home, but the server brought out two caramels sprinkled with sea salt (dee-lish) on a plate, and someone had drizzled chocolate on the plate to spell "happy birthday meredith!"  it was a lovely personal touch, and sweet that they threw in something special.  \u000a\u000ait's a pricey meal, but it was unquestionably the best we've had in pittsburgh so far.  i'd highly recommend it to anyone who has something to celebrate!

Vmy fellow supervisors and i came here for a pre-christmas lunch.  it was kind of our way of self-congratulating ourselves while our minions dined on mcdon.... i mean we decided to have a nice social outing with a very fine lunch.  \u000a\u000aanyway, the food here is to die for and it's certainly someplace you don't dine at every day.  i mean, when they describe their grilled cheese sandwich as "arsenal cheese curds, grass fed local white cheddar, parmesan, and onion jam" you know you're not dealing with the kraft american between two slices of egg-dipped toast that you get at eat-n-park.  even the burgers are made of braised veal.\u000a\u000ao but this place is far from pretentious as they can certainly back it up with the quality of food and service.  i went for the maine lobster salad with mesclun greens and believe you me, i don't order lobster very often but this was heavenly.  and for dessert, my boss and i split the chocolate-peanut-pretzel candy bar.  see, that's the great thing about sharing a dessert.  i had just enough room in my tummy for a little something to fill in the cracks between the parts of my main meal.  and since i'm a type-1 diabetic, splitting a dessert means i only have to take half the insulin to cover it.  so give me a small "pump that insulin, susan.  pump!" here.  \u000a\u000aand just what is a  chocolate-peanut-pretzel-candy bar?\u000a\u000ai'll give you a hint--it's definitely no snicker's bar.  it's a brownie with peanut brittle, and milk chocolate and peanut butter ice cream\u000a\u000aso anyway, we had a great holiday lunch here with fantastic food and amazing service.  if you work downtown, you owe it to yourself to have at least one fine meal here.

Vreally amazing food, excellent service, knowledgeable well trained staff, creative chef.  there is a lot of attention to detail at eleven, all the way from the food preparation to the delivery.  the staff is thoughtful and well trained.  the food is delicious.  don't forget eleven has a great brunch menu, too.  yes, the prices are expensive, but this restaurant is a great choice for a special occasion.

Vone of the top must try restaurants of pittsburgh.\u000a\u000ai have been to eleven twice. the first time was last summer for a small yelp happy hour. during this visit i tried the famous eleven burger (braised veal, bacon, onions, fries with your choice of white cheddar, maytag blue or goat cheese) i got it with everything on it and white cheddar. it was delicious! the fries that came with it were very tasty as well. i also had a few leven-ades (orange vodka, homemade lemonade and raspberries). \u000a\u000aon the second visit i took my wife for lunch for her birthday. i had previously made reservations though the open table app and let them know it was her birthday. she had the lobster roll and i had the hanger steak & fries. she loved it! i did steal a bite of it and it was one of the best i had ever tasted. the lobster was fresh and tasted like it was just caught that day. my hanger steak was very good also.\u000a\u000aafter we finished she was presented with their chocolate, peanut, pretzel candy bar. (brownie, peanut butter mousse, peanut brittle, pretzel and milk chocolate ice cream) it even had a piece of chocolate on top that said happy birthday! it was one of the best desserts i have ever had and is worth every penny! not to be missed!\u000a\u000aservice was wonderful as well. needless to say, when we left we were stuffed.

Vi didn't really like this place much, but i also came directly from lava lounge which was full of 80s music delights, so this was kind of a letdown.\u000a\u000anot too crowded, even on a friday, which was cool - front room was more full, but the back room (quiet with simple tables) was pretty empty.  they had a special that night on coronas, so it was nice to get cheap beer.  i really didn't like the music though - my techno-savvy boyfriend said it was "house" music, i think.  what can i say, i prefer music with....lyrics.  and songs that i recognize.  and songs, period.  \u000a\u000ait just wasn't my bag.  but i definitely didn't get a martini, or linger at a table, or come on a different night with different music.  i'd drop in again if i was back on southside and give it another chance.

V2.5 rounding up. \u000a\u000athis girl can only take house music in small doses so i never frequented z:lounge but when my friends and i did decide to pop in, we used to head straight for the back room which for some strange reason, never had anyone in it. it was a nice place to sit back and chill, have a conversation and a drink. upstairs charges a cover buut its basically the same as the front room downstairs just a little more crowded. bartenders are good at what they do, drinks themselves are pricey.

Vif you have a lub for house music, this is the place for you.  about the only place in the burgh that actually plays musical acts that don't show up on pop radio.  love the back room downstairs.  great place to just chill out, especially if you decide to do a bar crawl on the south side.  \u000a\u000adrinks are excellent, can't remember what i had but it was delicious.  bartenders are amazing and as pleasant as can be.  i really enjoy the place.

Vi stopped in here again tonight.  relaxing is all i can say.  opting to sit outside to take in the air and people watch was an amazing idea.  not only do you get the street ambiance, but you still can hear that music spinning inside.  quite a nice treat on such a nice day.\u000a\u000athe bartender tonight was so nice and on point.  polite is an understatement for him.  he even suggested that we sit outside since it was such a beautiful day.

Vi had dinner here last night and i can't claim to have as strong feelings as some of my fellow "yelpers".  i arrived around 8 pm after the extra innings of the pirates game and the north shore bar crawl.  i'm guessing my palate was dulled a bit by a day of eating nachos, hot dogs and drinking cheap beer.  i'd say the best thing about this place is the bar scene (which is on par if not a little better than capital grille) and my favorite thing about this place is the pretzel bread (which is awesome with lots of butter). that's right the best thing about this supposed high end steakhouse is pretzel bread.  that's it...  that's my review..... okay, a few other comments.  the bar service has always been pretty good, but not exceptional.  if it was better than average i'd guess that i would know a few of the bartenders.  the waitress was fine and the drinks are appropriately "stiff".  the lobster bisque was not too impressive.  my favorite steak place lobster bisque is the capital grille by far.   i ordered a filet with bernaisse sauce.  it was okay.  i'm guessing a prime cut, but definitely not aged like a steak at mortons or capital grille.  it was cooked well.   the bernaise lacked flavor which is important when eating such a dull piece of meat.  the sides were good.  we had the asparagus and spinach.  both were cooked and seasoned well.  a friend ordered the lamb chops which were good and a better choice than my filet.  i have to admit i've enjoyed steaks at "the outback" more than i did with this place.  this restaurant tries to be a mortons, ruths and the like.  but, it's really just a bit of an overpriced tgif.  it's not in the same league as a fine dining restaurant, which is unfortunate because there is room for more fine dining in pittsburgh.  again, it's not bad but i suggest that their is space for places like "the outback" and "mortons", but a space should not exist for something in between.  i suggest the best steak chain place right now is capital grille for quality of food and fun bar.

Vi've decided to write an update and add a star to this place after my experience last night.  i was there for a business dinner with a bunch of folks who encouraged me to add a star and mention each by name, so here i am.  this is a chain restaurant, but a relatively small chain with locations primarily in oh, pa and now fl.  they attempt to compete with the high end steakhouses (ruths, palm, mortons, capital grille) and up until last night i felt they were mostly out of their league.  however, my opinion has changed.  we arrived last night at about 6:30 pm.  they have a great circular bar with a few hightops and a deep relaxing red tone to the whole place.  their wine selection is displayed in the front near a few areas for lounging.  they have a couple of fireplaces and it's a white tablecloth type of dining scene with multiple private rooms.  it's a relatively large restaurant and they also offer valet parking.  in terms of atmosphere it may be my favorite.  the feel is a little different than capital grille which feels "clubby".  this place has a less formal or younger feel.  keith organized us all together and we started with good cocktails at the bar i had a nice ketel dirty rocks martini with blue cheese olives that was served by a very nice and professional bar matron.  we ordered a bunch of things, so i hope to remember them all.  i ordered raw oysters which were served fresh, cold with a nice tasting cocktail sauce.  tom had the seared ahi, which was good quality tuna coated slightly with sesame seeds and served with a wasabi and siracha sauce.  i think keith and lloyd ordered the calamari which was great!  if you can only order one appetizer here get the calamari.  it's lightly breaded served with a sweet and hot light sauce.  the only calamari slightly better in the city is my buddy ron's at pangea.  i can't quite recall if we ordered any other apps'.  i chose the lobster bisque instead of a salad and i was hoping it was better than the last time i ordered.  it wasn't.  this bisque was my only real disappointment of the night.  it was too think and the lobster was unnoticeable.  jim, matt and pat all ordered the iceberg wedge which was huge and looked really good.  it's your standard half a head of lettuce served with blue cheese and bacon i believe.  i was really impressed with the entrees' and sides.  they tailor a portion of the menu to reflect a sports theme.  they also serve plenty of steaks bone in which is much more flavorful.  i had the 22 oz. santonio holmes bone in ribeye medium rare.  it was delicious and as good as any steak i've ever had.  the beef was prime, cooked perfectly on an 1800' grille and served pipin hot.  i didn't care for the teeny onion rings on the side but they were easy enough to push away.  most of us ordered these and were all impressed.  keith had the bone in strip which also looked really good.  the sides were perfect.  the asparagus was huge and the hollaindaise was not coagulated.  the mushrooms were cooked well and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich.  there were a few desserts ordered.  i sampled the carrot cake and it was great.  it was easily big enough for three.  i mostly drank the house shiraz all night which was fine and i'm guessing less than $10 a glass.  overall this place has really picked up it's game and in my opinion can finally compete in the high end steakhouse arena.

Vhyde park has outstanding food! i love the atmosphere with all of the wood and reds and black. \u000a\u000ai have been twice. the first time i went was on father's day of this year. i had the prime rib which is to die for! the hyde park wedge salad is outstanding! i also enjoyed the roasted garlic whipped potatoes and fresh sauteed spinach and mushrooms! our waitress seemed to completely forget about us and took my wedge salad before i was done with it but the prime rib more than made up for her luck of customer service. all of the food was only $25 per person! they run a special on sunday's which you can't beat!\u000a\u000athe second time i went was on my birthday. they had another special going that only cost $19.99 per person for three courses! i had the filet mignon, wedge salad and mashed potatoes. all of which was just as good as the first time. the service was much much better the second time around. they even brought me out a hand made chocolate dessert with chocolate moose and a hard chocolate shell with a candle in it. it was the best dessert i have ever had! \u000a\u000ahyde park, i love you like a fat kid loves cake!

Vthe best place for cocktails in or near downtown; they do a happy hour from 4-6:30, and then another happy hour from 9 until close.  drinks were perfectly mixed, delicious, and half off.  \u000a\u000agreat for having a few drinks before a 7 pm baseball game, and every bit of food we've ordered from the bar has been delicious.  would rate this five stars, but haven't actually ever sat in the dining room.

Vhyde park, what happened?! \u000a\u000amy wife and daughter took me here today for my birthday and it was a absolutely horrible experience! the service was so so slow. we ordered our meals 10 minutes after we sat down and it took 40 minutes for me to get my shrimp cocktail appetizer. we had to ask for bread because we were so hungry from waiting. \u000a\u000ait took another 30 minutes for me to get my lobster bisque that had no lobster in it what so ever, my wife to get her salad and my daughter to get her burger and fries. \u000a\u000amy wife and i both ordered the filet mignon and crab cakes. the supposed filet mignon tasted like liver and my crab cakes were burnt and full of filler with little if any crab meat at all. we complained to the floor manager and she got the "guest service manager" matthew s. he was very apologetic and took our meals, drinks and desserts off our bill. he only charged us for my shrimp cocktail and my daughter's cheeseburger. \u000a\u000abefore today we went to hyde park four to five times a year. it's a shame because that dinner totally ruined my birthday. \u000a\u000ai'm not sure if i'll ever go back!

Vwill definitely be coming back, if only because they actually serve congee.  for real, honest to goodness congee.  not watered down congee, or overly thick congee.  just right. (although, they could have cut up the preserved egg a little more).\u000a\u000apea shoots were a little over salted, but those are so delicious that i don't care how i get it.  we also had gong chao ngo ho (that's beef with wide noodles), which was good, but the sauce was a little on the sweet side.\u000a\u000atoo bad that they don't have fresh roast chinese meats.  but whatever.  a real cantonese restaurant that i can come to whenever i'm feeling a craving!  now that's something to be happy about.

Vi'd rate this place anywhere from 2 1/2 stars to 3 1/2 stars if i could. why the disparity in rating? read on my friends.... \u000a\u000ayesterday was an unusually nice day for november. my husband and i took our bikes out one last time for the season and hit the trails. so when we came home, we were both too tired to cook. so we were looking for some good takeout food. we decided to try something different from our usual choices, the new dumpling house or silk pagoda. \u000a\u000athis place bills itself as "authentic hong kong cuisine", but to tell you the truth, there doesn't seem to be anything to distinguish itself from any other chinese place. there's nothing on the menu that really grabs my attention. on the other hand, the food here is very good. so what they do, they do well. \u000a\u000ai tried my old standby, shrimp with broccoli. rick tried one of his favorites, kung pao chicken. i have to say that rick likes his kung pao, and if it meets his standards, then you know it's good. and rick gave his thumbs up to it. my shrimp was very good and the broccoli was crisp and flavorful. \u000a\u000athere are a few small tables here and one that's large enough to accommodate a group. but for the most part, it's a take out place. oh, and cash only too. so while the presentation isn't the most imaginative in the world, the food itself makes it worth a try.

Vi stopped in here last in night to pick up some chinese food for me and my brother paul.  bro had just been released from a two week hospital stay and i figured he could use a little cheering up.  \u000a\u000aka mei has some very good authentic hong kongese dishes, but we went for more americanized chinese fare.  i guess you could call it comfort food.  we both opted for some vegetable eggrolls and some hot  & sour soup.   paul went for shrimp with chinese eggplant whereas i went for the chicken and garlic.  my chicken wasn't overcooked nor was the garlic overpowering.\u000a\u000aso ka mei's regular menu isn't all that inspiring.  who cares?  when you want comfort food, it fills the bill.  but i'm going have to try the hong kongese menu sometime.

Vi had lunch here yesterday and the place was pretty empty which is usually not a good sign.  we sat at the bar and the service was friendly and prompt.  the space itself is really odd, because it's located now in the old mill site tavern with old black and white pics of steel workers next to tacky mexican decorations.  i ordered three tacos, the chicken taco was pretty good but not memorable.  all three were served on really good authentic corn tortillas.  the chorizo was really good served with a little lemon.  my favorite by far was the seasoned pork served with plenty of cilantro and a few chunks of pineapple.  these tacos are authentic, which means pretty small all three would equal about 1/2 of a mad mex burrito.  my friend had the chicken burrito, which he said was very good.  their salsa with  the chips was spicy and crisp.  this is a decent lunch spot, probably wouldn't spend my evenings here however.  overall, a good 2nd choice to el campesino for real mexican food.  i'd give it four stars, but i believe it's a bit overpriced especially the drinks.  they charge $2.50 for a bottled water??

Vhad the enchiladas verdes which were surprisingly edible, although what's the deal with the sad looking shredded iceberg lettuce in this city? i've been sorely disappointed with mexican food in general in pittsburgh, and while this wasn't up to the standard i was used to in california, it was "decent." the salsa was sufficiently spicy and i'd even venture to say it was "good." drinks are also served here, but they come on a separate receipt... service was also decent; i'd go back here again & give it a second try.

Vwe tried two cupcakes last night: the vegan margarita and a chocolate cupcake with chocolate ganache.  total: $5.00.  the chocolate cupcake was very dry, and the thin layer of ganache didn't help.  maybe if there was more icing on top, to balance it out, it would have been better.\u000a\u000athe vegan margarita cupcake was yummy and very moist.  i didn't really taste much of the supposed tequila-lime flavors, outside of the slice of lime on top (cute touch), but it was a good vanilla cupcake.  the icing is sweet enough without being too gritty with sugar.\u000a\u000athe storefront is cute and decorated well.  it was empty when we went in, but seems like it could accommodate an after-dinner rush easily.  i think it's irritating that the cupcakes in the case aren't labeled, and the clerk didn't seem too happy to tell us which were which.  if it's such an inconvenience to you, make some labels and then i wouldn't have to ask.\u000a\u000aoverall conclusion: i'm sticking to the vegan cupcakes, despite being a vehement non-vegan, since they seem to be moister.  (i had heard the same thing about dozen's cupcakes.)  if they started carrying puppy cupcakes, as the other cupcake bakeries i've been to do, it would be the cherry on top of... well, on top of a yummy cupcake.

Vi don't get the hype. first off, they don't have ac or at least they're not using it. now pittsburgh gets balmy in spring and summer and i like my thai food spicy, ac is crucial. the food is okay, they have some chinese dishes and mediocre thai. the place itself is pretty small and showing wear and age.

Vanybody who knows me knows i'm a wiener world girl. but to be fair, i decided to try franktuary recently. you know, in all the years that i've worked downtown, i'd never thought of trying this place. \u000a\u000ai must admit that they have some unusual dogs here.  they have the hypocrite, a veggie dog smothered in chili. they have the chicago impostor, relish, tomato, banana peppers, chopped onion, yellow mustard, pickle spear, and celery salt .  they also have the locavore, an organic, grass fed, all-beef dog that's supposed to be healthy (um, no.  if it's healthy, it ain't a hot dog).\u000a\u000ai settled on the italian dog, with mozzarella, tomato, garlic, olive oil, and basil.  you know, it was actually pretty good!  \u000a\u000afor those of you who don't like dogs, they have salads and chicken wraps.  service here is fast and friendly and they deliver and cater.

Vservice was great, selection good, but to be honest, the regular hot dog that they serve is a very plain, skinny, vienna style dogs and the buns are very cheap white buns. the toppings are good but if i went back i would try the locovore (sp?) rather than their regular hot dogs to get some good flavor.\u000a\u000aoverall most specialty hot dog places i have gone to have great tasting dogs that they put into a unique tasty bun. franktuary doesn't have that so i don't really see a need to go back.

Vpicture the scene.  a beautiful spring day.  a coworker and i decided, "what better way to spend the lunch hour than dining al fresco and enjoying the delectable properties of fine encased meats?"  now i'm really a wiener world kinda girl, but my coworker really had the taste for fine hotdogs served out of the back of a church.\u000a\u000aso let's see, which particular blend of sodium and nitrates appealed to susan's palatte?  the locavore looked tempting.  the imposter (a veggie dog)?  uh, no thanks!  the chicago impostor?  possibly.  the buffalo?  hmmm, a dog with blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce!  the new yorker?  a dog with 'kraut and onion sauce?  hey, now we're talkin'!   http://www.franktuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ny.jpg and with a side of coleslaw and pickle spear!  mmmmm!

Vi usually avoid hot dog places, but i'd heard so many people rave about this place that i finally had to try it. location is in the basement of a church downtown - hence the name. the grass fed beef "locavore" dog was hands down the best tasting dog i've ever had the pleasure of devouring! lots of interesting toping choices such as the "italian" with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese! i had a smoothie which was excellent, and they also offer salads. worth trying!

Vsince we don't work downtown, my boyfriend and i arranged to have a lunch at franktuary on a friday after his classes were over.  we couldn't find anywhere to park, so i had to pull over on the side of the street with hazards on while he ran in to get our hot dog delights.  almost fifteen minutes later, he emerged with a paper bag of goodness, and we were out of there!\u000a\u000aat home, while we put the foil-wrapped dogs in the heaven to reheat them slightly, he explained to me that it took so long to pick up the dogs because they cook them to order - they aren't pre-cooked and hanging out under a heat lamp.  but there wasn't any line at 1:30 pm on a friday, so if you take a late lunch, you should be good to go.\u000a\u000awe put all the hot dogs on a little plate and cut them all in half, for easy sharing.  looking back at us was the el greco (feta and artichoke hearts), the chicago imposter (chicago-style - mustard, relish, onion, banana pepper, celery salt, tomato, and pickle), and the pittsburgh (a pierogie and cole slaw).  nom-licious.\u000a\u000apresented, in ascending order of tastiness.\u000achicago imposter - this was, embarrassingly, my first chicago-style hot dog, and shame on me for not having one before despite all my time in the chi.  this one was my least favorite, but i am unable to determine whether it's because i don't like chicago style, or because i don't like the way franktuary does it.  i suspect the former reason - something about the sweetness and the acidity from the relish - i just don't think it's my thing.  i mean, we still ate it - but it was both of our least favorite.\u000a\u000ael greco - coming in second - who'd have thought of putting feta and artichoke hearts on a hot dog?  surprise surprise, it works!  one of their simpler dogs, with only two ingredients, this one had good flavor.\u000a\u000apittsburgh - the absolute undisputed champion.  go.  eat this.  now.  we were both utterly bowled over by how good this one.  we kept exclaiming things like "this is so good" or "mmmmmmm!" at top volume.  it's the pierogie.  the cole slaw was very good, but the pierogie seals the deal.  most brilliant hot dog ingredient ever.  next time we'll get two of these, one each, and then a third new flavor to try.\u000a\u000ai'd recommend one-and-a-half hot dogs per small person, two per everyone else, especially if you aren't getting side dishes.  they go down fast!  also - the "normal" all beef franks are juicy and great - the localvore one is good too, but has a more nontraditional "meaty" taste and texture.  i say go for the classic dog, it's a better bang for your buck too!

Vwow, pickles is great.  once a year, when you are tired of getting your grad student snobbery on at kofusion or where ever and need a near lethal injection of kitsch.  when i went, it was still decorated for christmas, and they had metallic green pickle ornaments hanging on fake trees, and drawings of pickles trimming a christmas tree on the specials white board.  and it is not ironic.  these people are serious.\u000a\u000amy burger was palatable, my fries were much better, and they did have heineken.  also a "side of the day."  today it was macaroni salad.  wow.\u000a\u000aunfortunate note:  though all our entrees were served with pickles, they were terrible.

Vi like siam terrace, i do, and you can't go wrong with a pot of tom kha, but i really think the food at thara thai is better, and it's so much cheaper at thara thai i can't get worked up about siam terrace.\u000a\u000aif i lived in urbana, i would probably still go here alot, but i don't live in urbana, so i've only been here twice in 4 years.

Vuggh i think guido's is my favorite bar in champaign.  the "uggh" is because my favorite place in champaign still has miller light girls wearing slutty referree outfits at football games.  \u000a\u000ai'm pretty sure they have the best bloody mary's in town, and their pineapple upside down cake martini is more or less killer-- as are all their specialty cocktails, for that matter.  which is probably why if you go after 9pm, even if you are lucky enough to not have to stand in line, you almost definitely won't be able to get a table.

Voh my god, i hate this ups so, so, so much.  i have never been there 1 time when there wasn't some crazy ass shit going on and being completely mishandled by the single, bitchy, employee.  it is only open 4 hours a day.  it is clearly, drastically, understaffed by people who hate their jobs and take it out on the customers.  the computers never work, the lobby is way too small to handle the amount of traffic that comes through, and nothing is ever where it is supposed to be.\u000a\u000aone word in defense of the crabbiness of the employees though:  in my visits to this ups customer service location i have witnessed some of the most astounding acts of customer stupidity i have ever witnessed in my life, including in 3 years of working in a cofee bar:\u000a\u000a--trying to ship monster truck tires.  not in boxes.  no addresses printed on them.  just monster truck tires.\u000a\u000a--trying to ship refrigerators.  entire refrigerators.  plural!  two refrigerators!  also not in boxes\u000a\u000a--trying to ship all of one's worldly posesseions.  in boxes this time, but in about 400 small boxes.\u000a\u000aif i had to deal with being yelled at because ups charges more to ship monster truck tires than fedex does very single day, i would be crabby too.

Vi can't beleive i haven't reviewed pnc park sooner!  let's be clear about one thing--the pirates have not had a winning season since before i became an adult.  at least they have not been to the post-season since 1992.  i was 15 at the time!  \u000a\u000abut, oh, if they ever had a "worst-team-with-the-best-ballpark" award in the majors, the pittsburgh pirates would certainly win it!  pnc park is way better than what it replaced--three rivers stadium.  even though three rivers probably had the last cheap general admission seats in the majors.\u000a\u000athe design of the place is wonderful.  first of all, it's small.   this gives every seat a great view of the action.  you really feel like you're a part of something, instead of being in something so vast (hello, chicago's us cellular field!).  second of all, the view from pnc is spectacular!  you really have a good view of downtown and the rivers, unlike the old three rivers stadium, which had no sense of place.  the only drawback is that it put home plate in the "wrong" corner of the ballpark.  homeplate should always be in the southwest corner.\u000a\u000awhat really makes pnc park stand out is that there's  pedestrian and riverboat access.  it also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the roberto clemente bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk.   they do the smart thing by closing down the bridge to traffic, so that it's an easy walk.\u000a\u000astill, despite it being a relatively new park, you can get rather inexpensive tickets here.  box seats will run you about $16.00-$35.00 and this is where i prefer to sit.  but as i said before, there ain't a bad seat in the house and you can sit in the upper deck granstand for $13.00 to $16.00, the left or right field grandstand for $6.00 to $9.00, and the bleachers for $9.00.  whenever we have "girl's night/day out at the game", we always get the cheap seats.

Vpnc park is one of the best baseball stadiums in all of mlb. i've been blessed to have this park available at my fingertips, since i work in pittsburgh. but, no offense burghers, i am also blessed to not be from pittsburgh originally so i don't have to be a bucs fan. \u000a\u000adon't get me wrong. i have no problems rooting for the pirates when i am at games (except when i went to the bucs vs. yanks game this year). i would just be so frustrated being a local fan. the past two years, i have had the pleasure of watching some of the staples of the pirates ballclub - nady and bay, namely - play their hearts out even though they are always bound to losing seasons. (what are they at now? 16 consecutive losing seasons?!) why, why, why would they get rid of such talented and passionate players?!! i know, i know, it's a matter of the business. both players would be free agents in a year or so. but still, the pirates organization has no gratefulness to its fans! for those fan who go to games no matter the results of the games, the fans that continue to pay money to support their team, my heart goes out to you. \u000a\u000aat least you all have a beautiful ballpark. after all, this is not the place for the pity party. this is the place to praise what you do have, not what you don't. \u000a\u000aso, my justification for the 5 stars: \u000a1. one of the best views from any park - downtown pittsburgh is just darn beautiful especially during those night games. \u000a2. great food - prim bros: a local favorite and one to try for all tourists, quaker steak & lube: delicious wings in a big bucket, and all your ballpark favorites.\u000a3. a great view from all seats - there really isn't a bad seat in the house. except maybe the seats at the angles where your legs jam into your neighbors. not an issue for me, i'm short.\u000a4. really nice club boxes - i've been once and the seats are comfy, the room is nice, the food is decent, and the beer is great.\u000a5. all you can eat seats for $35 - all the hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, salads, popcorn, peanuts, ice cream and soda you can eat while you attempt to fit into the seats in section 147 for any game.\u000a\u000aso there it is. i love this place. although losing the young stars is not much incentive to go. i think i'm boycotting for the rest of 2008, but i'll be around when the boys come back next year.

Vgirls, i have something to tell you.  i absolutely love taking my dad out for father's day--just the two of us.  every year, i'll take him to either the pirates or the washington wild things game.  it gives us a chance to really spend some time together.  we get a chance to talk without spouses, siblings, relatives, etc, present.  we both enjoy a ballgame together.  you should take your dad out too sometime.  do something you both enjoy and spend some quality father-daughter bonding.  \u000a\u000ai've already said a lot about how great pnc park is.  the ticket prices are some of the lowest in the major league.  i think the ticket prices top out at around $45.00 per seat.  this is both great and bad for fans.  great because a pirates game is relatively inexpensive viz-a-viz other mlb teams.  bad because the pirates haven't exactly been a winning team and can't command premium prices.  i paid $14.00 each for two bleacher reserved seats.  dad likes sitting out there.  he says it gives him a view from the perspective of the players.  personally, i prefer sitting in the left or right field boxes with their spectacular view of downtown.  but hey!  it was his evening out.\u000a\u000awe saw the bucs beat the cleveland indians 4-3.  the bucs took two out of three from the tribe.  eddie vedder once sang about the chicago cubs, "someday we'll go all the way".  hey, if he sang about the pirates it'd be "someday we'll make .500!"

Vthe best ball park i've ever been to in america. fantastic view of the city, great firework shows, well planned and thought out park. large clean restrooms, easy ingress and egress what more could you want.\u000a\u000aoh year that's right some good food. the only thing sorely lacking in this place is good food. come on pittsburgh, hot dogs, hamburgers, primanti's and fried food galore is a rather pathetic offering. i mean even the condiment bars for the hot dog's and hamburgers were sorely lacking. hello pittsburgh let's have a reality check here, even the st. louis rams have stir-fry, taco bars and higher end offerings and better condiments than you do. your food service is stuck back in the 1970's while the design of the park is 2010. \u000a\u000astart serving some decent eats and i would happily change this to 5 stars.

Vi clearly was mistaken... i'd been to an interleague game before.  two years ago i took my dad to a pirates/indians game here.  see, i treat him to either a bucs or washington wild  things game every year for father's day.  we took last year off, opting instead for an elvis costello concert.  and boy did we pick the wrong year not to go.  2011 went down as the year the priates didn't suck (so badly).  \u000a\u000awell this past saturday night i resumed the tradition.  and it was a good thing i long ago bought two tickets cheap on stubhub.  saturday night's game ended up being the fourth sellout of the season.  in fact they had an announced crowd of 39,312.  although i suspect a goodly amount of them were on hand for the post-game boyz ii men concert (wait, they're still around?).  \u000a\u000ai'd managed to get two tickets in sec. 124, behind 3rd base.  if you ask me, secs. 120-124 are the best seats in the house.  you get a really great view of the skyline from these seats.  that was one of the many problems with the old three rivers stadium--you had no sense of place there.  pnc gives you a great view all around, and you really feel like you're in the middle of the city.  \u000a\u000athe food here is okay, but only just okay.  if do do eat at the park and want a little variety, i suggest the diamond pizza behind sec 138.  they've got your typical pizzas but they've also got a chopped garden salad, chicken salad, anti-pasta salad, and chicken and veggie wraps.  o' but i did partake of some rita's italian ice.  \u000a\u000amy dad and i had a very enjoyable night together.  hands down, pnc is one of the best ballparks around.  and we're actually inching our way towards having a team worthy of such a great facility.\u000a\u000ano, we didn't stay for boyz ii men.  i hated them as a teen and i sure as shite wouldn't want to see 'em now.

Vthis is the first restaurant i have possibly ever been to where i felt actively annoyed by the waitstaff.  you'd think that was impossible, since it's a flippin' buffet, but lo.  the woman whose job it was to fill up our drinks managed to only ever reach for my glass when it was going to involve sticking her arm between my chopsticks and my mouth.  some man came over and engaged us in a lengthy dialectic about whether or not we would like him to make us some dipping sauce.  what flavors do you like?  how spicy do you want it?  for 5 minutes after our food came, during which we couldn't eat!  then he brought us over dishes of sauce that we could have selected ourselves from the buffet!\u000a\u000aadditionally, i was unsatisfied with my food.  i followed one of the sauce suggestions at the buffet, and was treated to a steaming pile of oily stir fry that literally smelled like the nasty gunk that gets stuck in a horse's shoe when it walks through a cow pasture.  the pineapple in the buffet was from a can, the meat was a low grade cut, and there was about 100 times too much oil applied to the grill.  \u000a\u000athe only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that it's got an ambience that is well above the campus mean.

Vi really had fun at this place.  the bar scene is decent and the crowds are younger and typically enjoying themselves too much (like me).  i've been here a few times and meant to write a review.  the last time i went i was with a friend of mine who is a school teacher in vegas and she was really blown away.  this place definitely is not the kind of place you  go with a teachers salary.  i had intially tried to get a reservation and was told none were available.  i then talked to one of the casino hosts who a friend hooked me up with (jesse... young asian guy).  and, magically we had a prime table at 8 pm.  you should dress to impress and plan on dancing the food off after dinner.  we went with another couple.. none of my friends had been there before and defaulted to steaks.  becky had a filet (i think.. had a few drinks by dinner time).  it was cooked perfectly and was definitely a prime cut.  i tried it and while it was tender and moist i think in general filet's lack flavor.  mike had a bone in ribeye which  was  awesome and probably one of the best tasting steaks i've ever tried.  i don't remember what his wife had.  since i've tried the steaks before and quite frankly in my opinion steaks at the high end steak places all pretty much taste the same to me whether its mortons, ruths, capital grille etc.. i think they differentiate themselves with atmosphere, service, and the sides.  i had a lobster that they cracked for me.  it was ridicoulous.  i think it was like 3 lbs. and i would suggest if you are going to try this you should ask the price first.  i'm pretty sure this lobster was around $150.  it was good, cooked perfectly and lots of butter.  the sides were pretty good, but nothing remarkable.  we had the mashed potatoes.  i think there was lobster in it (but not much).  for some reason i'm pretty sure they didn't have asparagus, which was disappointing.  overall a fun experience, great service, good atmosphere, and i definitely suggest hitting the "ghost bar:" next door.

Vafter passing dozen twice daily since august, i finally decided that i had to stop in today.  (i tried once before but it was late, the selection was not the greatest, and they had no puppy cupcakes so i didn't get anything.)  today we got a milk chocolate cupcake, a pumpkin maple cupcake, and a bag of 6 dog cupcakes for a total of $10.\u000a\u000ai really enjoyed the pumpkin maple.  it had a strong pumpkin flavor and wasn't too sweet.  i think that the icing makes the cupcakes too tall to fit in my mouth, so i kind of nibble away at the bottom until it's short enough that i can get both frosting and cake in each bite.\u000a\u000athe dog cupcakes went over extremely well.  they have a really strong peanut butter scent, so if your dog is a peanut butter lover, s/he will probably love these.  their website says there's also some carrot in there.\u000a\u000aboyfriend says his chocolate cupcake was "just bad", and specifically was bland and very dry.  he says he does not plan on going back.\u000a\u000ai think the yummy pumpkin maple cupcake and the puppy cupcakes will get me to return.

Vi wish i could give 4.5 stars, as this is one of the best bakeshops i've ever been into.  squirrel hill is easily pittsburgh's destination neighborhood for desserts and sweets.\u000a\u000athey serve five varieties of cupcakes every day, and that menu repeats weekly.  (monday has the same things as last monday.)  there's great variety and experimentation here; everything from "vanilla" to "pancakes and bacon", and some whiskey-chocolate concoction that wasn't half bad.\u000a\u000athey have, hands down, the best icing i've ever had on a cupcake.\u000a\u000aon the minus side, the non-vegan cupcakes are often dry, and they only really have seating for two folks at a time, which is problematic when it's not warm outside here in the winter.\u000a\u000ago here.  try at least two different cupcakes.  it's awesome.

Vi am not a huge fan of cupcakes or the big sweet dollop of frosting style, i've been to at least a few of the supposedly great cupcake places in ny, and these are pretty indistinguishable from those. \u000a\u000athe green tea almond, as cupcakes go, was very good though.

Vi had the vanilla vanilla, and it might have been the best cupcake frosting i've ever had in my life.  i tried my mom's rice crispy treat and it wasn't so great, but i'm going up to 4 instead of down to 3 because it is a cupcake place, not a rice crispy treat place.

Vi like that this little store has a variety of clothes that you probably wouldn't find elsewhere in pittsburgh.  these clothes are not at all for those of who work jobs requiring business casual or business attire to work.  this is definitely clothes for the weekend, relaxing, or the evening.  most of the clothes come in small or medium (the large is either not ordered or already bought up, can't be sure of that).  prices are moderate, approximately $50-60 per shirt.  they have cute jewelry too and some other accessories and shoes.  don't be fooled by the store looking closed - i almost left because it looked closed - the lights are just dim inside.

Vso, i'm heading to mineos on murray ave. in squirrel hill for my pretty standard hangover cure (2 slices and 2 cokes), when i happen to see the "smallman street" deli on murray ave.  now, i used to visit the smallman street deli on smallman street in the strip district religously when i lived a couple of blocks away, but haven't been by in years.  i was pleasantly surprised to see this deli located in another part of town.  i immediately park in the automotive packed traffic jungle that is murray ave. on a weekend and head over.  i pass a subway restaurant that is jam packed with folks jamming down $5 footlongs with maybe the best deli in pittsburgh literally two doors down.  i'm assuming this one is pretty much the same as the one in the strip meaning it's basically a take out place with a couple hightops, but not meant for sit down meals.  it already has a plus than the original because this one is open today (sunday).  i walk in and their are the coolers to my left with lots of great deli meats and specialty cheeses and a counter straight ahead where to place my order.  the menu items are posted on a chalkboard above the counter.  i order a hot pastrami signature sandwich served on rye with dark mustard, a cup of matzah ball soup and a scoop of chicken liver (i know, i most likely jewish in a former life... don't get me started on lox).  i look to my right and to my surprise there is ample booth and table seating with a couple of tv's with nfl on.  awesome, i can actually sit down read the paper and watch tv... then, i see something that is another revelation.  they have a cooler full of bottles of beer and a sign that says something to the effect of help yourself... now, this is getting good i can even have a beer with lunch.  this is much better than the original location.  the waitress brings my food in less than 5 minutes.  the matzah soup is piping hot with a delicious broth and a softball sized matzah ball.  the soup is a hit.  the sandwich is fantastic.  the rye bread is great quality and the dark mustard rich and flavorful.  the pastrami is warm and packed with tons of flavor.  it's a big sandwich, but not so big that i need to use a knife and fork.  they have like a super signature sandwich that has over a lb. of meat, but that would violate my dont' eat anything as big as your head rule.  it does have a bit of gristle on it, but that's what i prefer (however, for $1 more you can get "lean" pastrami).  the chicken liver was kind of meh'.  it didn't really have any seasoning or chopped egg.  i only put a little bit on the sandwich.  the tomatoes and lettuce on the side had also seen better days.  the total cost of the meal not including a bottle of domestic beer was about $15, so it's a little pricey compared to subway subs, but i believe a good value.  they cure all of their meats at their strip district location.  i was a bit confused with respect to the tipping aspect with this place.  you don't really have a typical waitress situation.  you place your order at the counter, grab your own drinks and outside of bringing you your food you don't see her again.  some tipped nothing i noticed and some tipped little (5%).  i chose to tip almost as much as i would at a typical restaurant, but not quite 20%.  this was a great new discovery for me... and maybe, a new hangover cure.

Vi hoped/knew this place would be good.  you can't have a deli in the jewish-est neighborhood in pittsburgh and not have it be delicious.  and it's but two blocks from my house!  who lucked out?  that would be me.\u000a\u000awe went here for a brunch on sunday - if you can call it brunch at 2pm.  plenty of seating.  i ordered the half sandwich/cup of soup/fountain drink deal.  it was something like $8.50, which was a pretty good deal.  also, i wanted an old fashioned cream soda instead of a fountain drink, which costs extra but they didn't charge me.  yay!\u000a\u000asoooo service was pretty slow, but there seemed to be only one woman taking out food orders and cleaning tables, so i can't really hold that against her.  my corned beef sandwich arrived on rye, with spicy brown mustard, and a bit of swiss cheese.  my matzo ball soup arrived hot, with a big fat fluffy matzo ball just chillin' in the middle.  everything was very delicious.  the corned beef was juicy, the bread was fragrant, the matzo ball was soft and delicious in my mouth.  big fan of my meal.  \u000a\u000ai would love to come back for breakfast, lunch, or just to get some deli meat/cheese goodness.  and i will come back, because as i said, it's just two blocks away!  yup, living the good life in squirrel hill.

Vafter a day of cleaning out the ole homestead rick and i were just too tired to cook.    believe me folks, we were just in the mood for some good ole fashioned comfort food.  i didn't want to get gussied up either before going out.  i just wanted a place i could go to in t-shirt and jeans, hair in a pony tail, baseball hat on.  y'know, all this time we've lived in the neighborhood and we never once checked out the smallman street deli.\u000a\u000athe dinners here are pretty basic, but oh so good!  i'm talking entrees like roast chicken, brisket & gravy, stuffed cabbage, turkey & gravy, etc.  i went for the 1/2 roasted chicken which was just delicious.  in fact, i took half of it home and i'm gonna have it for lunch tomorrow.  rick went for the pastrami & latkes which looked good too.  dinners are around $12-$14 each and they come with soup or salad and two sides.  \u000a\u000ai'm gonna have to come here for lunch someday and try my a sammitch.  their u-can't eat it signature sandwich is over 1 pound of meat on rye with mustard!  holy macaroni, i could get four lunches out of that!  they also do catering here.

Vtake a really crummy day weather-wise--what better reason to go out and have a great sammitch for lunch?  actually those who know me know any reason is a good reason to have a great sammitch.  weddings, confirmations, bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, the 8th anniversary of your second cousin's third promotion at work, or the fact that you're just plain hungry--all are great reasons!\u000a\u000ai went for the junior signature sandwich of pastrami on rye.  sorry, i just can't manage the full-sized one unless i'm sharing.  but oh my, it may have been the smaller version but it was good.  they say they make their meat homemade on the premises and boy is it obvious.  my friend marla went for the double play combo of kosher bologna and kosher salami.  uh, okay hon!  \u000a\u000aand for you "seinfeld" fans, they have the uncle leo here for breakfast--the lox, egg & onion.  i've gotta try that sometime.  it looks like smallman street deli is gonna be stiff competition for my other two favorite sandwich places--ruggeri's and frick park market.

Vthis is the definition of a hole in the wall.  it's take-out only; there's maybe four seats in the place, meant mostly for you to hang out while your food is cooked.  they don't deliver.  they're often busy.\u000a\u000aputting that all together, if a restaurant doesn't deliver, and doesn't have any seating, and has a stream of people through the door... the food has to fill the gap.  and it does.\u000a\u000ai'm a big fan of the sesame tofu.  need to stop back again soon.

Vi love mom & pop places. zaw's is the best! i live close so i always get there before my food is done just to watch them cook. the kitchen does look dingy but i'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic. the gentleman behind the burner is so quick and knows the recipes by heart, the son (i'm assuming) takes care of the orders and register and he is extremely kind. everything is made to order even the hot & sour soup (which is the best i've ever had, seriously). i like to try new things each time i order but i'm stuck on the coconut curry tofu. forget lulu's, howe lee, new dumpling house, and all of the other chinese places, go to zaw's instead.

Vi really like this restaurant - it is cozy, unpretentious and truly has the feel of a european bistro.  i love that it is in point breeze.\u000a\u000aof course, their most popular dish (and my fave) is the moules frites (mussels and fries with aioli).  i love the white wine sauce, so that is what i get, but i hear the other sauce options are good too.  i suggest getting the appetizer version and sharing it with a friend.  we've had other stuff off the menu and while decent, nothing that i was blown away by!  \u000a\u000aon sunday, they also do a brunch.  it's good.  i think that i prefer the casbah brunch, but the food here is good and you do get a nice deal (with drink).  \u000a\u000adecent belgian beer list, not up to the sharpe edge, but really, how many places could be like the se?  wine list is just ehh.  \u000a\u000aoverall, a decent place with great moules frites and a fun atmosphere.  i definitely will continue to come to thsi restaurant!

Vas i sit here writing this review, i still have a very faint smell on my fingers of mussels in white wine heaven sauce. *sniiiff* ahh, delicious. calm down guys, i only went last night and the smell is starting to fade away. most of it is now a fond memory. \u000a\u000ai give this place 4 stars because my one experience, and what i ordered was great. i've heard from others that the other selections aren't as good. stop ordering the other things then! if a place specializes in delicious mussels, year round, then order that! i got the white wine based cream sauce. it was awesome! i was drinking that stuff like it's soup, using the mussel shell as a spoon. i don't know if that's acceptable, but it's how i roll. \u000a\u000aother than that, the beer selection is great. i had the maredsous 8, a darker beer, on tap. oh boy was it tasty. the fries are really good too, and they serve it with mayo. \u000a\u000ayes, this joint is overpriced, but it's not as bad as the other reviews make it seem. the moules frites will run you $17, and the beer is about $7.50 (thanks to pa's drink tax, i'm sure), but you pay for what you get: good food, the cozy atmosphere of a wannabe european bistro, and on a nice day/evening you can sit outside on their patio overlooking a quaint residential area of pittsburgh.

Vi had dinner here last night and there is really nothing bad about this place i mean i wish i could give it 4.5 stars.  this place is located in a part of town that i often forget about.  it's by wilkinsburg and in between shadyside and regent sq/squirrel hill.  it's the epitome of what a neighborhood joint should be.  it's packed with super friendly and efficient staff who know most of the folks. the prices are fair and the folks are friendly.  we got here last night early and got what i would say is the best booth in the house towards the back up some short steps.  since we were here early there wasn't a wait but it was stilled filled up.  by the time we left therer was people almost out the door.  and, this is on a tuesday feezing cold february night.  that says a lot!  the space is so warm and perfectly decorated.  the lighting is flattering the bar seats about 10 the other tables and booths fit maybe 50.  the tables are a little too close together and privacy is limited, but we found ourselves chatting with the table next to us.  we are greeted by a nice young server wth a big smile who starts by saying "can i grab you a beer?".  they have a great belgian beer selection second to only sharpes edge, but the food at sharps edge doesn't compare.  my friends ordered a couple of extremely reasonable priced belgians and i had a very inexpensive excellent peter lehmann shiraz.  the drink prices are great!  we started with the cheese platter and added sausage.  the platter itself was good and had a great variety of room temperature cheese (served correctly).  the selection was good there was a sharp cheddar, blue cheese, and a few others.  it was also served with apples, walnuts and dried cranberries.  the sausage was tasty as well.  it was served with crusty bread.  the bread here btw is top notch.  then of course we ordered the moules and fries.  there was three of us and we each tried a different sauce.  the red curry sauce was great served with just the right amount of spice and cilantro and cream on top of perfectly plump fresh mussels.  the classic sauce was also good with garlic, shallots, wine and a hint of cream. this was my second fav' sauce.  i wasn't all that impressed with the tomatoe, fennel and saffron broth.  it was watery and didn't add much to the flavor of the mussels.  the fries are as good as any in the city, fried twice and served with a basil mayo.  they do mussels and fries better than anyone in the city, but i've been told the rest of the menu is great.  the next time i go which may be tomorrow i was so impressed i'll try some of the other items like the seafood waterzoii which is like a cioppini and i hear excellent.  overall this is a great spot and i wish it was closer to my home it would become my new local bar.

Vsome of the best food i've had in pittsburgh; point brugge features friendly service, and a pleasant ambience. this place is quite popular, so expect to wait between 45 minutes and an hour for your table. brunch is served on sunday mornings only (after 11am) but is well worth it!

Vmaybe my expectations were a bit too high, but i was kind of disappointed in my brunch at point brugge.\u000a\u000athere was maybe a 10-minute wait for 2 people at 1:00, which was not bad at all.  the restaurant itself is nice, even though the tables are a bit close together.  service was nice and quick without being obtrusive.  i ordered one of the prix fixe meals - liege waffles with fruit, the potato strudel, and a mimosa, plus a side of fries.  the fries were pretty good and crispy, but not mind-blowing.  the mayonnaise was not particularly basil-y.\u000a\u000athe waffles - not that great.  the menu says that liege waffles are supposed to be dense and a bit crunchy with a caramelized sugar flavor.  they were kinda bland and dry, except where the fruit topping had been, where they were soggy.  syrup or butter would have helped.  the mimosa and the potato strudel were both very good.  my friend ordered the french toast, which looked awesome.  i kind of wish i had ordered it instead.  total was $36, which seemed a little pricey, but we did get a fair amount of food.\u000a\u000aoverall, i wouldn't mind giving it another chance but i wouldn't be devastated if i never made it back.

Vthis is by far one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh.  tucked back in the residential streets of point breeze, you can actually sit on the patio and not deal with road noise.  imagine that!\u000a\u000abeer selection is great, and service is friendly.  the decor is nothing special, but it doesn't detract either.  come for the moules and the beef entree.  pretty much everything here is delicious, so you can't go wrong.  my only complaint (and it's not even really a complaint) - sometimes you have to wait and they don't take reservations.

Vpart of a double header, i hit up point brugge for dinner saturday night and also sunday midday for brunch.  the result?  two perfect meals.\u000a\u000afor dinner, a friend and i split an order of mussels with the red curry sauce along with an order of crab cakes, chicken skewers, beer battered shrimp, and dessert.\u000a\u000athe giant dish of mussels came with two large crusty pieces of bread and came with an order of brugge frites which were paired with a basil mayo dipping sauce.  and oh my goodness that red curry sauce.  we asked the server for a sauce recommendation and without hesitation he told us to get the red curry sauce.  maybe it's because i enjoyed the asian influence behind the dish, but it was so delicious.  the red curry was rich from the coconut milk yet not overwhelming in flavor.  and you get sooooooooo many mussels too...\u000a\u000athe brugge frites were absolutely perfect.  enough said.\u000a\u000athe small plates we got were all pretty good, but i don't think i'd get the chicken skewers again.  they're cooked well, but not super inspiring.  the cheese tray and the mac 'n cheese both intrigued me; i definitely gotta try them out.\u000a\u000adessert was an apple walnut crostada with fresh whipped cream.  sinfully delicious.  it was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.\u000a\u000a*********\u000aby the recommendation of so many yelpers, i knew i had to try out point brugge for brunch too.  i ended up getting there right around noon and not having to wait at all for a table.  i went with their prix fixe selection and had an eggs benedict with a side of house-made apple sausage and a glass of mimosa.\u000a\u000athe eggs benedict were pretty good; not traditional eggs benedict but still tasty.  the sausage was this ginormous patty that was well seasoned and cooked well (as opposed to poorly cooked sausage?).  it was just so big though.  next time i'd probably split the sausage or just settle with a granola with yogurt.\u000a\u000ai'm always happy with mimosas, and my friend described their bloody mary's as "f***ing good."\u000a\u000aone of the guys next to us ordered the corned beef hash and it looked so sinful tapping into my gluttonous side.  the pair of eggs over easy on top of everything were basically just aching to be cut open to reveal the beautiful oozing yolks inside.\u000a\u000ai'm also curious about their scrambled eggs w/ chevre cheese and of course their smoked salmon scrambler.

Vwe went there for brunch with high expectations and left disappointed.\u000a\u000athey were busy with a very eclectic crowd of people; if you wear thick rectangular glasses, have blue hair, wear patagonia and north face clothes around town or like jeans and blazer you will fit. the r ambience is okay for a breakfast or lunch spot, but leaves a little wanting for a dinner spot, especially considering the prices they charge.\u000a\u000aservice was good - no complaints. bloody mary was good but lacked depths of flavor, tomato, spice (hot sauce, pepper, horseradish), come celery salt and that was it. you can find that in most bottled mixes. i was displeased to find that they had charged me full price even though i had ordered a virgin bloody mary, with the exception of some resorts i have never seen that done before.\u000a\u000ai had the eggs benedict with ham; the texas style toast it was served on did not match nor compliment the dish at all. the ham was good, not salty, sliced thin but it was overcooked with some black spots on the edges and beginning to dry. eggs were done perfectly. the pesto hollandaise had no discernable basil flavor to it all, the miniscule amount of pesto put into it added nothing. the actual hollandaise base tasted only of butter, now hollandaise is a butter sauce but it should have the richness of egg yolks prevalent. this one had none and was very pale in color. not very good 2 stars\u000a\u000asuggestions: not sure what the concept you are going for - italian eggs benedict? use a sundried tomato/garlic bread sliced thin, ham eggs, regular hollandaise with more yolk flavor and a chiffonade of basil and tomato concasse on top to give it a stunning appearance and better flavor. serve it with fresh strawberries marinated in balsamic vinegar.\u000a\u000athe second dish we had was the gran marnier french toast - good concept but failed execution again. the crme anglaise was great - keep that, the actual bread used was terrible, doughy, chewy and not good, plus it was burnt, so were the two others that i saw placed in front of people. turn down the temperature at what you cook this at and change the bread. then allow the bread to stale up over night - this is important for the taste and texture of french toast but keep the crme anglaise. overall 3 stars.\u000a\u000aso why all the high ratings?\u000a\u000amy theory is that pittsburghians seem to love restaurants that take classics and change them. i am all for that - however there appears to be no analysis of is the change 'better', the same or worse. it seems to me any change is counted as a good thing. \u000a\u000aambiance 3\u000aservice 4\u000adrinks 3\u000afood 2.5\u000avalue 2\u000a\u000aaverage 2.9 stars

Vpoint brugge no longer represents solely a restaurant that has good food; it has become the place where i can sit back, relax and chow down on comfort food while leaving all my problems behind.\u000a\u000afor me, everything is just right about point brugge.  the noise is always loud enough where i can be myself and won't bother other patrons.  the lighting is a comfortable glow where you can see everyone else around the table but aren't left in an awkward dim or the blinding light of fast food restaurants.  and oh the food.  i always have a large order of mussels to split, an order of macaroni gratin, and a bottle of chimay red.\u000a\u000asome people prefer the mussels with the white wine sauce, others prefer the red curry sauce.  i really have no preference; both are delicious and i love sopping up either sauce with their warm crusty bread.  the best part though is their macaroni gratin.  the cheesy blend of parmesan, gruyere and cheddar is ultra rich and i love cracking through the crunchiness of the top crust with my spoon revealing the gooeyness inside.  all of this is of course washed down with a bottle of chimay red.  they have other varieties, but i think chimay red pairs the best with the food at point brugge.\u000a\u000ai never walk out of point brugge without a smile.

Vi've been here once for brunch & once for an afternoon beer. brunch is creative & fun, but come early to find a seat. it gets crowded quickly. in the afternoon and evening, the beer selection is good - centered around belgian beers - but prices are expensive. in fact, that's the only drawback of point brugge.\u000a\u000aotherwise, great neighborhood restaurant bar in one of my favorite pittsburgh boroughs.

Vpretty darn sure i wrote a review of this before - where did it gooooo?\u000a\u000awell all right yelp, i'll do it again, albeit two months after my visit.\u000a\u000ai had been wanting to try this place as long as i've been in pittsburgh, as it's been universally recommended to me by every friend and coworker i've met so far.  i went on a saturday, but early in the evening - i think around 5pm - to ensure that we got a table.  the plan worked -we were seated almost immediately and it wasn't long before the bar filled with other patrons waiting.  go early!  especially on the weekends!  you won't regret it.\u000a\u000awe ordered a few different beers (my boyfriend, my mom, and i) and shared them all.  the only ones i can recall ordering now are the leffe blonde, and delirium tremens, which my mom the doctor found hilarious.  all the beers we had were excellent across the board, and paired beautifully with the food.\u000a\u000aso....we basically pigged out. first we ordered the macaroni gratin to spplit amongst the four of us, and it was excellent.  say it's nothing more than mac 'n' cheese with a fancy name, and i won't argue with you, but the quality was superior to any i've had in a restaurant, ever.  i was dreaming about it afterward.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i also tried a small bowl of moules frites - i can't remember now whether i got classic or red curry - but they were excellent as well.  i remember loving the basil mayonnaise served with the frites.  for the main course, my boyfriend and i got the carbonnade flamande - a delicious braised beef stew.\u000a\u000asince it was two months ago, i don't recall specifics, but i recall that everything was divine and that i was so full i could barely walk/breathe.  i'd suggest coming back often and trying a new thing each time, instead of trying to eat everything all in one visit like i did.  but oh, it was fun to try!  i would love to come back for dinner or brunch, anytime - as long as it's early enough to avoid the rush!

Vthe most high end thai place in  the city.  the atmosphere is very nice with warm lighting and candles.  the seating is spread out to welcome privacy.  the bar is okay located near the entrance, but barely used.  the outdoor seating is awesome and one of the few spots on s. highland where you can sit outside and drink.  the service is okay, but not especially useful.  when asked what  is the favorite of the waiter we got the customary "everythings good".  i like that they remove your doggy bag and give you a coatcheck type ticket instead of leaving it on your table.  the wine selection is okay, but overpriced like everywhere else.  i need to find a place that has reasonably priced wine, i mean $15 for a glass of conundrum??  wtf!  the food is as good as any thai i've ever tried in any city, and quite frankly should be for the prices.  it's quite expensive for thai food.  we started with chicken satay, which was pretty good, moist and flavorful.  also tried a ceviche, which was dynamite, very spicy and a "typhoon" roll which wasn't that good and didn't have much  flavor.  susie got the salmon, which was well seasoned and served with delicious rice.  fiona had the pumpkin curry which was delicious, good spice and a nice portion with fresh vegetables.  i tried the duck basil which was cooked perfectly and had a delicious basil sauce, that was spicy and packed with herbs.  the coconut ice cream is delicious as well.  good place, but definitely not cheap.   it was close to $300 with all courses, tip, and plenty of wine.  you can probably get thai close to as good as this without the atmosphere and wine for less than $50.

Vthere are some higher-priced restaurants that excel in excellent food.  there are other restaurants where after a certain point you're just paying for the service.  typhoon serves up decent food but is mainly a restaurant where decor and ambiance is king.\u000a\u000awe started mussels off the appetizers menu to split.  i ordered a duck breast dish for my main entree.  the mussels were pretty good.  they got me excited for my duck breast.  i found my entree to be a bit on the overly sauced side and excessively salty.  it came with sliced duck breast, peppers, onions, mushrooms, cooked in a basil sauce.  the sauce covered up the taste of the duck, which definitely ruined the dish for me.  i don't typically eat too much rice when i'm eating asian foods, but i ended up eating most of the rice that came with it.\u000a\u000ai find typhoon to be slightly better than soba when it comes to actual food.  i haven't had a chance to try soba or typhoon's drinks or desserts yet, so my reviews might change down the road.\u000a\u000auntil then, 3.5 stars.

Vwithin the past year, quaker steak and lube opened up a new location in oakland. back in college, i would have to drive 20 mins out towards the airport to get my quaker steak fix. back in the day....\u000a\u000aquaker steak claims to be the "best wings usa" and i do like them a whole lot. i haven't had the "real" buffalo wings in buffalo, but i am making it a life goal to take a trip and try them for myself. until that time comes, quaker steak will be my wings place. they have other things on the menu too, but i wouldn't know anything about them.\u000a\u000athe oakland location is convenient but it's not my favorite place. what i do like about it is that you can look right into the kitchen from the take out window. as i waited for my order, i watched them fry my wings, pour on the sauce, shake it around in a big plastic bucket, and create a masterpiece in my styrofoam take-out container. yum.

Vthe best wings in pittsburgh! \u000a\u000aas a part of pittsburgh as primanti brothers. this location is in the heart of oakland near pitt and is considered an express location meaning that it doesn't have everything the bigger locations have. they have tons of different sauces from mild to so hot that you have to sign a waiver for. some of my favorite ones are louisiana lickers ( a hot, cajun, garlic and barbecue mix) and arizona ranch. (a hot and spicy ranch) my only complaint is that the wings are really, really small. \u000athe wings are so get and then you're pissed that they are all gone! \u000a\u000athe loaded magna fries are great too. fries covered with beer cheese dip, bacon, scallions and ranch. they are epic! my daughter and wife loved the onion rings. \u000a\u000athey also offer cheessteaks, gyros, soups, salads and kids meals.

Vi expected more from you qsl...but you have failed me *sad face*\u000a\u000ai think i now  know why you are and "express" location...because everything is fast paced and not everything is available at a typical restaurant.  i really wish you would just add the fried pickles to your small list, it doesn't take up too much room.\u000a\u000awhy am i sitting here with the saddest face in all of pittsburgh?  because i paid $1 more for my chicken fenders & magna and all i got in return was one crummy piece of bacon on my heap of fries...humph.  well, honestly, that's not the only reason, you gave me ranch, yes ranch, instead of bbq sauce for those fenders of chicken.  no beer cheese, no bbq sauce, my styrofoam case basically melted around my food.  hmmm, i think that means i need to stick to your full service location for my qsl needs.

Vi think i'm over qsl.  that about sums it up.  this location is a disgrace to the chain.\u000a\u000amy most recent experience, which was just one hour ago, left me at a loss for words.  working in oakland and having a limited amount of places that deliver, qsl is usually a decent enough place to order from.  or at least i thought that, not so much anymore.  after reading their menu i decided i would try something new that i haven't had before.  i opted for the chicken and mac n cheese.  with this you get to choose the lube sauce you want.  i opted for the golden garlic sauce and thought that would be mighty tasted when cut up and mixed with the cheese.  well, it may have, but they messed up the order.  what i got was their mild sauce, or at least i'm guessing that.  on the receipt it says 'buffalo chicken.'  as for the 'generous portion,'  maybe if you are a child.  i am an adult, and a generous portion or your pre-prepared mac n cheese should not be less of that that you get in a microwavable one from kraft.  the garlic bread that comes with it might as well have been called wet cardboard.  toast implies that it'll have a crispy crunch to it, not that you could probably throw it and it'll stick to the wall.\u000a\u000aas for your receipts, do not insult me by highlighting the bottom about how much tip  you want.  i tip, and i tip well, but do not insult me by telling me that you are more expecting than suggesting what i give you extra.\u000a\u000ai do not like giving out one star reviews, but with being insulted this much by this location, there is deserving in it.

Vthe night i got into pittsburgh, natalia and i wound up at the double wide grill. this place used to be an auto shop. i would have loved to see the making of process this place went through. the lamps hanging above the tables are old oil cans. the old garage doors are bolted up to the ceiling as skylights. there is an old truck above the bar area. it's really a creative space. the booths are comfortable. the layout is a bit strange, but it totally works. we got wings to start which were some of the best wings i've had and i am a lover of wings. then i went on a potato roll and ordered garlic herb mashies and potato tacos. what was i thinking? yeah, even as delicious as the potatoes were, i regretted it 1/3 of the way through my potato tacos. there is only so much potato that you can eat in one sitting and i overshot that. oops! next time i come back i'm going to venture out. maybe by then they'll add pulled chicken to the menu. why do lots of southern cookin' type places have this ridiculous aversion to pulled chicken!?

Vthe doublewide embodies a lot of conflicting emotions for me. \u000a\u000apro: i believe they have the greatest seitan wings & pulled seitan sandwiches in town - this can go a long way for a vegetarian. \u000acon: i am decidedly uncomfortable with their version of "southern garage" culture. section 8 meals? oh god. i'm actually from a place with southern "hick" mechanics, and it is a little excruciating to see realities be turned into themes. \u000a\u000apro: their beer draft lift is exciting, with a nice balance between old friends and new adventures. \u000acon: the brunch is gross. veggie menu options are slim and everything we ordered was just gross. brunch is very important to me, almost sacred. \u000a\u000a\u000athe service is almost always fantastic, though, the servers are quick and knowledgeable. the food is solid & portions are manageable yet filling, but the seitan wings are a-mazing. i think the price point is a little high, but i guess it's alright to indulge in dressed-up down-home faves occasionally. the chairs and tables are big & sturdy, and the decor is some creative mash-up of a service station and a shiny corporate restaurant. \u000a\u000agood place to take a date: it's not so loud you can't talk, and i've never been gay-bashed there or anything.

Vdouble wide grill has a pretty laid back, chill atmosphere. i had sunday brunch here and was pretty satisfied with my meal. i ordered the double wide benedict and devoured it quickly, mostly because i was starving at the time. the order was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid plate. the poached eggs were nicely done, and the hollandaise was good. they have a regular eggs benedict, but the double wide is unique because it is on corn bread rather than the english muffin. the salty sweet combo made it different and rather enjoyable. \u000a\u000aif you're looking for some outdoor dining, they have a nice area outside, which they call their patio - good for daytime brunch in the sun, or getting some fresh air with your beer during happy hour. \u000a\u000aalso look for their specials - ribs night and happy hour/night specials. i haven't been here for drinks yet, but they do have a nice draft selection. i'll be sure to check it out soon!

Vdouble wide grill is one of those places you go to when you just want to have a fun, enjoyable meal.   and for those of you from chicago, i don't mean the "fun-crammed-down-your-throat-with-a-toilet-plunger" atmosphere of ed debevics.  it's a place to simply go an enjoy yourself.\u000a\u000aso i was out with my girl posse on friday night.  we were going to the movies nearby at south side works, so we wanted a place nearby to have a casual meal.  we started our meal with some wood grilled veggies, which were delicious.  they have an interesting concept here called "tv dinner on trays" in which you can build your own platter by choosing 1 "on tray" and 3 sides for $15.99.  marla tried that and wimped out 1/2 way through it, so she took some home.  sherry tried the barbecue chicken ranch salad.  maryann went for the wood-grilled chicken burrito.\u000a\u000aand then there was susan.  sometimes susan gets really hungry.  sometimes susan wants just a plain ole good cheeseburger.  and there's only one type of meat that susan acknowledges as a burger--beef!  no turkeyburgers, no ostrich burgers, and certainly no veggie burgers will do.  besides, veggies are a side dish, not a main dish.  oh, and susan's cheeseburger?  yummy medium well with grilled onions.

Vsolid, greasy, comfort food whether you come here for lunch, dinner or breakfast. lots of their menu items can be or are vegetarian or vegan. big drink menu including some frozen concoctions such as blended mojitos and mudslides.\u000a\u000ahuge tvs and lots of them, so i can imagine this place will be great to watch a game at. we'll see how they look during nba playoffs!

Vwas wandering around the south side and decided to give this place a try.  i ordered the "hot" seitan wings, and they were very good but a bit spendy at $8.99 for 6 chunks of vegan protein and some soggy carrots.\u000a\u000athere is a full bar here with a good selection of craft beer.\u000a\u000abonus points for the dog-friendly patio.  i may come back with my pup for "wing" night wednesdays in the summer!

Vwe have never been disappointed by double wide. the food is consistently well prepared and tasty. the menu has something for everyone - even my finicky tween sisters and my uber picky mum. the hubcap potatoes are a must try (especially if you're a garlic lover). \u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i seem to always get the same waiter which is fine by us - he is always super attentive without being intrusive and overbearing. he (i'm horrible at remembering names) is also extremely knowledgeable about the food. \u000a\u000aoutdoor seating is always a plus and there is plenty of it.

Vi'd been craving barbecue for weeks, so with a groupon in tow, we headed out to double wide grill on saturday night to feed our bellies.\u000a\u000awe got there around 7, and waited 10-15 minutes for a table.  it was nice weather, so we ambled up and down the block.  you can give the host your cell number so they call when your table is ready - it was very convenient and allowed us to take a walk instead of having to hover around the host stand.\u000a\u000awe were seated inside at a booth, and we both got a kick out of the old-service-station decor.  maybe "decor" isn't the right word, since this place actually was an old service station, it doesn't just look like one.  several tvs were around the room, but the volume was quiet until the penguins started playing.\u000a\u000athey had a pretty cool selection of draft beer - my boyfriend was very impressed and got some unusual beer.  can't remember what it was called but it was 9% alcohol, served in a smaller glass, and he enjoyed it immensely.  they were out of blue moon pumpkin so i tried something from their wheat section - i want to say it was southampton something or other?  it was light and refreshing.\u000a\u000athe boy got a full rack of ribs, and i got the brisket and pulled pork platter.  both came with cornbread, slaw, a pickle, and fries - but i got their "hub cap potatoes" instead.  it was a ton of food!  we could not finish it between the two of us.  we took a whole half rack of ribs home because we were simply too stuffed to proceed.  makes you wonder how the guy on "man vs. food" can do it.\u000a\u000aso everything was pretty much "okay" in my book, although my boyfriend enjoyed everything a bit more than i did.  i found everything to be too salty - i was continually going to the coleslaw and my water glass to drown out the saltiness.  i wasn't a fan of the pulled pork - the barbecue sauce used was very vinegary and tangy in a somewhat unpleasant way. the brisket was better - juicy, and with a sauce that was more sweet.  still, it didn't blow me away - pretty standard.  the ribs were just okay too, salty and without a lot of sauce.  the best part of ribs is licking sauce off your fingers, but there wasn't much to lick!  also, the meat separated from the bones as soon as you pulled on them - the meat slipped off before we could even take a bite, so we didn't get the fun experience of holding up a meaty rib and nomming the meat off the bone.  we were left with just a plate of meat, which wasn't quite as fun to eat.  cornbread was good, fries were addictive, and the "hubcap potatoes" were okay - nice garlic flavor.  nothing was very hot (temperature), seemed like maybe the food had been sitting for a while.\u000a\u000aspeaking of "a while," service is very slow like everyone else says.  our waiter was certainly friendly and pleasant, but we waited a long time to be greeted, a long time for our beers, and a very long time for our food.  sounds like that's just the way it is here.\u000a\u000ai was feeling sort of "2 1/2 stars" about the whole thing, but my boyfriend was so enthusiastic about the meal that i'll go ahead and give it a 3.  if you're craving barbecue it's a fine place to go to take the edge off, but it isn't the real deal.

Vi love the outdoor seating, and i especially like the brunches.  i also think their specials, such as their "all you can eat ribs," are a very good deal.  the food is pretty good, the people watching is excellent.  the gingerbread pancakes are excellent.  the service varies, but i generally get pretty good service at the double wide.  it's a fun place to go eat, almost everything is down home.

Vi'll be rounding up to 3.5 stars here.\u000a\u000ai was a bit disappointed with my recent visit here.  the thing that made me this disappointed was that they replaced their 'hubcaps' with 'lug-nuts.'  sad face.  instead of crusted fried to prefect ion goodness, you now get lumped overly cooked crusting blandness.  can't really get a garlic taste out of that.  it's not hard to process those tiny potatoes into the goodness they once were.  however, i still ate them.\u000a\u000athis journey we had a nice seat outside to take advantage of the beautiful weather.  the waitress was on point and able to give some good tips on the food.  i opted for the breakfast burger with the lug-nuts.  my drink of choice this time around was a wonderful mix of corona, orange juice and hot sauce with a hot spice rim around the cup.  the breakfast burger was amazing, egg, bacon, cheese, all that goodness between two pieces of texas toast.  really made me feel like i was sitting outside an old gas station with all that grease dripping onto the plate.\u000a\u000ai love the decor in the place, the trunk on the rack over the bar really does remind you that it is an old gas/service station.  the awesome aroma from the wood fire grill however brings you back to reality to let you know it's an ass kicking place to eat.

Vone of the few places in pittsburgh where vegetarians and vegans aren't an afterthought. look at the back of the menu for lots of great veggie and vegan options. and, they are especially tasty, not your run of the mill grilled veggies.\u000a\u000awe tried the seitan wings, which were very good. hubby had the grilled portobello reuben, which he thought was quite good. i had the grilled tofu with chimichurri sauce. both were tasty options that we can't get elsewhere.\u000a\u000avery laid back atmosphere, probably great for groups, but also for those with children. we'll be back for the brunch.

Vi'm not really a huge fan of cheesecake factory. the cheesecake really is good, and of course their selection can make anyone happy. their food is reliable, and seems to be pretty consistent across all the franchises so you always know what to expect. i guess i'm just not a fan of the hype. this one is no different, but the location is cool. \u000a\u000afor those of you who don't know, south side works is an up-and-coming area just outside of downtown pittsburgh across the river from oakland. if you want a good slice of cheesecake, go to cheesecake factory. but there are a few other restaurants around the neighborhood, so check those out before dessert.

Vi sooo wanted to dislike this place.  it just seemed kind of silly when i heard of people waiting two hours to eat at what i thought was essentially a tgif.  i first ate here about ten years ago in vegas and i remember not being terribly impressed.  and, this was at the time when i thought the ground round was formal dining.  that being the case i was sure i would be disappointed this time.  i had lunch here on monday afternoon with a friend.  it was around 230 pm and it was on a monday so they weren't that busy.  the space itself is very nice.  it's attached to ross park mall and is very big with a large open air environment.  the booths are spacious and the place feels clean and has a lot of dark wood.  as soon as we entered we were greated with a big smile and a friendly host.  we were seated at a good booth and the server arrived promptly.  they had a fun selection of iced teas and i think i had the passion fruit iced tea, which was "unsweetened" but i didn't believe it needed any additional sugar.  i ordered a black bean soup that was the special.  it was about average and the consistency for me was a little too mushed.  the sour cream on top was a good amount without being overwhelming.  they had a huge menu which is always kind of scary because who can do so many things so well.  i ordered a "navajo" chicken sandwich.  the reason i wanted to try it is because the bun was native american fry bread.  my friend ordered a burrito.  the navajo sandwich was delicious.  the fry bread was light and airy and perfect for the sandwich, which was chicken breast and avocado mostly.  the chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.  the avocado was perfect.  i often order avocado and it's not ripe enough.  the fries were forgettable.  lisa's burrito was as big as my head.  it was okay.  definitely a very americanized burrito relying more on heavy sauces and cheese than distinctive ingredients.  i'm not a dessert person, but she ordered the oreo cheesecake (i think?).  it was good, but not as good as i would expect from the "cheesecake" factory.  the service continued to be perfect.  i was really impressed with the staff here.  this place is definitely better than tg mcfunsteres... but, probably still not worth a two hour wait.

Vi visited here with my family, and thankfully the wait was not too long.  (i've visited the one in columbus and the wait on a weekend is still 3 hours, years after it opened.)  we didn't think much of the atmosphere - it was quiet and very dark, almost to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.\u000a\u000ai ordered a pasta but requested no nuts on top, due to my allergies, which i made clear to the waitress.  because the restaurant was so dark, i didn't realize right away that there were nuts on it, but when the waitress came around again, i had to send my food back.  this always leads to awkwardness - do your dining companions keep eating, or do they let their food get cold while you're waiting for a new dish?  the manager apologized but we were still charged for the meal.  we thought the least he could do would be to comp it, as the whole incident considerably disrupted our dinner and it was the fault of either the waitress or kitchen staff.  but we decided to not make a fuss.  we ordered cheesecake to go, as we were full.\u000a\u000aonce i got home, i dug into my chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake.  at the time (this was several years ago), the menu did not mention that the cookie dough contained walnuts.  there was no little asterisk, no caution from the waitress, nothing.  i probably should have asked, but normally chocolate chip cookie dough does not contain walnuts, and with food allergies on the rise i feel that a restaurant should warn its patrons.  i made a complaint on the website and received a $25 gift card.\u000a\u000ai haven't been back since, not because i'm boycotting but more because i don't find anything particularly fabulous about the menu and the wait times can be ridiculous.  but i did want to warn anyone with food allergies to be very careful about what they order, and to double-check with your waiter/waitress to avoid any bad reactions.

Vthe cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. i've had several entres and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. i'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\u000a\u000athat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert.

Vthis is the first cheesecake factory in pittsburgh. this location is in south side works. the service used to be so good when it first opened but now it's horrible! most of the servers are spoiled college kids with snobby attitudes. \u000a\u000aplus it's hard to find a parking space. they do offer valet parking and will validate your parking ticket for up to two hours if your parked in one of the surrounding garages\u000a\u000aeven though this is the larger of the two locations there is allways a wait. \u000a\u000athe portions are large enough to share. the food is always good and hot and there's something for everyone. \u000a\u000asome of my favorite appetizers are the roadside sliders, southern fried chicken sliders and the firecracker salmon. \u000a\u000amy favorite specialties are the ranch house burger, steak diane and the grilled shrimp & bacon club. \u000a\u000amy favorite cheesecake is the dulce de leche caramel cheesecake. it is absolutely amazing!  \u000a\u000amy favorite drinks are the tropical smoothie and the frozen iced mango.\u000a\u000athey don't offer a kid's menu. but they do offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread.

V(start rant)\u000ai don't like reviewing chain restaurants b/c well.... they're chains.  and the pro's / con's of a chain typically persist from restaurant to restaurant.  this review is no different.\u000a\u000acheesecake factory has decent food w/ large portions.  there's something for everyone on the menu.  except those watching their figure.  if you've never seen their nutritional information before and aren't in the mood to cry, stop reading.  for everyone else, read on.\u000a\u000a**********\u000alet's start with a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer to split!  oh wait, that's 1270 calories?  with 38 grams of saturated fat?  and 2270 mg of sodium?  hmm, let's skip that and grab our entrees.\u000a\u000ai hear their chicken madeira is pretty tasty!  oh hi there 1420 calories, 44 grams of saturated fat and over 2000 mg of sodium!  how about some pasta?  i hear their bistro shrimp pasta is legit!  oh wait, it's 2290 calories and has 73 grams of saturated fat...  i guess i'll get some healthy seafood instead...  that miso salmon sounds good!  and so does the 1670 calories that come with it, along with its 39 grams of saturated fat and over a day's worth of sodium!  (note: none of these figures include any sides: add a mashed potatoes and you get an additional 560 calories)\u000a\u000ai think i'll stick with a salad...  how about the grilled chicken tostada salad?  the chicken is grilled so it has to be healthy right?  if 1130 calories with 2150 mg of sodium is healthy, then i guess so...  (here's a note of comparison: two big macs actually has less calories and sodium than this salad.)\u000a\u000aadd any slice of cheesecake and you have over a day's worth of calories and fat and sodium (all cheesecakes have at least 300 mg of sodium and some specialty desserts have over 1000 mg)\u000a**********\u000a\u000ai don't mind calorie laden food, but i'd rather save my calories for tastier food elsewhere.  yes restaurant food is typically bad for you, but if i'm dropping $20-$30 for dinner at a place and it's going to be bad for me, the food better be delicious, and taking reservations might be nice too.  since cheesecake factory doesn't take reservations and the food isn't all that great, i feel no remorse whenever i pass by cheesecake factory in lieu of other restaurants.\u000a(end rant)\u000a\u000aokay cheesecake factory isn't the spawn of the devil as i had put it out to be, and it's not too bad for larger parties with picky eaters.  and it's not like i'm going to cry if i were to go back again and again, it just wouldn't be my first choice for dinner.... or second, or third, or fourth or fifth...\u000a\u000asorry ladies; you better pick somewhere else to go for that girl's night out if you want that killer beach bod in time for summer.

Vmy first time in a cheesecake factory was last week, when we had our office holiday lunch there.  i was struck by how...well....huge the place was.  i felt like i was in honey i shrunk the kids, if that movie took place in some kind of pseudo-tuscan sculpture garden.  seriously, the building is enormous, the ceilings are waaaaay up there, and the food....i felt dwarfed by that as well.\u000a\u000aour servers were super friendly, especially considering how challenging it can be to serve a party of twelve.  everything came out quickly - surprisingly quickly - almost as if they predicted what we were going to order and had it waiting for us.  i'm assuming that isn't the case, and that all the food is just organized in such a way that any dish can be assembled in about 5 minutes.\u000a\u000ai had some bites of various appetizers, including the fried calimari, the hot spinach and cheese dip, and the warm crab and artichoke dip (which is technically a "small plate," not an appetizer).  i just realized how humorous it is that one of the dips is described as hot, and the other as warm.  they both tasted hot to me!  all the apps were okay - the dips were gooey (in a good way), the calimari was crispy.  everything was a bit on the salty side, not surprisingly for a chain restaurant, but not unpleasantly so.  the spinach dip was a little runny for my taste, but it tasted good!\u000a\u000afor my entree, i got the cuban sandwich.  it had all the classic ingredients: pork, ham, swiss cheese, mustard, pickles.  it also had mayo on it, which i didn't really care for - i know they do that in some restaurants, but i don't really think of it as traditional. and they were pretty heavy-handed with it.  other than that the sandwich was all right - again, pretty darn salty.  my boyfriend ate the other half later and he really enjoyed it.  i think in retrospect, i should've gone with a different choice.\u000a\u000afor dessert, i had the snickers cheesecake.  a good size slice, served unnecessarily with two huge scoops of whipped cream (seriously, what?  who needs all that?)  i really liked the cheesecake, but ended up taking half of it home, along with some of my coworker's pumpkin cheesecake which was also delicious.\u000a\u000athe prices are affordable, the service is uber friendly, the cheesecake is tasty, and the food is pretty reliable.  i'm not big into chains so i don't think i'd be keen to return, especially since they do have a heavy hand with salt, and because the food here is, well, massively unhealthy.  i found the nutrition facts on another website and, well, it scared me.  i can see why some people would really like this place, since they have a huge variety of things and big portions. nothing really wowed me, but it was a fine place to have a company lunch!

Voh pumpkin pecan cheesecake, i love you.\u000a\u000ai've never had anything i didn't like and the service has always been efficient. \u000a\u000athe menu is extensive and there is something for everybody. my 3 sisters are the pickiest eaters ever and today they cleaned their plates! \u000a\u000aprices are decent, the 4 of us had lunch and 3 slices of cheesecake and it was $75. it looks fancy but you can go in jeans and a t and feel comfortable

Vi've had a couple of very different dining experiences here at ibiza.  my first experience here was horrible - if it weren't for the fact that i wasn't alone, i would swear i must have remembered it wrong.  but, i'll spare you the details and not really let it affect my review, because i think a lot of the problems were due to its being newly opened at the time.  \u000a\u000asince then, i had another friend who wanted to give it a try and so i agreed, with a bit of apprehension.  the wine bar is next to mallorca and owned/operated by the same people.  there is a front dining area, the wine bar itself which is small, a back dining area, and when decent weather prevails, a back patio.  i highly recommend that back patio if you can get it - it has a good vibe to it and is private and cozy.  the staff still gets an attitude that is a bit pretentious, as well as their hosting staff, but other than that, the service is fine.  the tapas itself i feel is slightly overpriced, but decent.  i have also had better tapas in general so that clouds how i feel the pricing is.\u000a\u000apittsburgh lacks for decent wine bars, so in light of that, ibiza isn't all that bad.  the food and wine list are decent, so definitely worth a try.  i'd really give this place a 3.5 stars.

Vthis place is run by the fine folks who run mallorca and is pretty much the polar opposite portion size to mallorca.  it's located nicely on e. carson st. and provides for complimentary valet on the weekends,so you don't have to deal with the hell of parking in the s. side on a saturday night.  it's right across the street from the birmingham bridge and is beautiful inside.  the lighting is awesome with very high ceilings and an upstairs dining room that is perfect for hosting a small private party.  another great aspect is the private patio in the back, i mean what could be better than drinking sangria, eating foie gras, outside in the city.  the bar is pretty small right across from the open kitchen with some hitops for drinking and sampling.  it's fun having an after dinner drink at the bar.  mainly because they swear back and forth like sailors in a portugese accent.  someone should post it on youtube.  i last ate here on monday night and the place was expectedly pretty empty, except for a few at the bar.  we were seated in a nice location by the window, perfect for people watching.  we ordered a bottle of wine, conondrum i think?  it was overpriced, but still i've seen worse.  then we began our selection of delicious tapas.  this is the way i love to eat (small plates).  who wants to have 40 bites of anything, so we started with 4 tapas.  i'd say 2 to 3 each is plenty, by the way it can get very expensive when some of the tapas are $15 each or more.  i ordered foie gras, which was overall pretty good, but some of the pieces were overcooked.  i had my friend try it without telling her that it was goose liver.  she liked it until i told her.  we also ordered brie with strawberrrys a bit undercooked should have been more gooey, but the sauce was nice.  we also tried a risotti which was a little too big in my opinion to be called a tapas and they should have made it smaller and charged less.  we tried a piece of filet which was tender and good.  we had a few other things, but i'd had some wine by then so i can't quite remember.  overall good date place.  go and sit outside and get adventorous with your ordering.  try the sangria also.   with a few improvements, could be 4 stars.  it's the only authentic taps place i've found in the burgh.

Vthis is the only steak 'n shake i've ever been to, so i don't really know how to compare it to others.  i have never observed any heinous uncleanlinesses, despite the fact that the decor is primarily white and is lit by the most migraine-inducing possible flourescent lights.\u000a\u000aso, it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for being well kempt and having a waitstaff that is way more patient with late night hysterical student milkshake procurement than i could ever have imagined possible, but loses that third star because said milkshakes, once procured, taste like they have had 10 pumps of sugar syrup injected in and the frenchfries i ordered to go with said milkshakes tasted like they had been fried in grease that was maybe 36 hours past due to be replaced from the ol' fryer.

Vphenomenal live music, cheap beer, great bartenders and a good crowd make for a hell of a destination.  visited this place the first time when i was living in washington, dc, and the feel of the crowd at the moose blew the hell out of anything i was seeing in dc.\u000a\u000awhereas a lot of pittsburgh's gone nonsmoking, this place is still a smoking establishment, for better and worse.

Vi was here with a group of about 12 people tonight, and i think at some point independently each and every one of us said "i can't believe this is in champaign," with an emphasis on "i can't believe this is in champaign behind the neil street post office."\u000a\u000afor real.  this is the best food i've had in champaign.  my strip steak was a fantastic cut of meat, prepared perfectly.  i sampled almost everyone else's dish, and there was nothing that i couldn't have eaten a whole plate of.  duck enchiladas, man.\u000a\u000ahit it up now, before word gets out and it gets impossible to get in.

Vthis is a good deli in a surprisingly deli absent shadyside.  i was here on saturday afternoon with a friend who suggested.  we walked in and the space was pretty open with a great beer selection and plenty of plasmas displaying everything from tennis to soccer.  the service was okay, but nothing special.  i tried the motza ball soup which was a little below average. the chicken broth was tasty enough, but  the motza had a stale flavor maybe?  i had the "russell" which was roast beef marinated in barbecue served on really good bread with hot pepper cheese and onions.  this reminds me of a beef bbq at the world famous bob's sub in slippery rock, pa.  it was pretty good, but maybe should have tried the cuban.  my friend ordered a turkey wrap which looked okay, but i don't think she was too impressed.  the curly fries she ordered were a nice option.  overall this is a c+ deli, which probably couldn't cut it in squirrel hill and wouldn't last a week in nyc.  that being said i'd go here anytime if i was in shadyside and needed a sandwich.

Vnice selection of beer, but i've found the food to be hit or miss. i've had some good sandwiches here in the past, but the grilled chicken wrap i had a few days ago was subpar. also not a fan of the way all the food seems to come with potato chips. still, this is a decent place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a sandwich.

Vever since kazansky's in my neighborhood closed, i've been looking for a good deli.  so having the day off from work yesterday, i finally got the chance to check out pittsburgh deli company.  so when checking out a new place, i always start out with the basics.  i figure if they can do the basics right, then i can move up to their specialties.  \u000a\u000aso i ordered the rachel, hot corn beef, swiss, cole slaw, and russian dressing, on rye bread.  delicious.  their sandwiches are huge, so i like how you can order a half if you want.  i had mine with a bowl of yummy chicken noodle soup.\u000a\u000aone thing for all you insane clown posse fans out there--they have faygo pop here!

Vso slooooooow. \u000a\u000ai really like their jerk chicken. from what i've heard, it's pretty authentic, especially the part where they literally butcher chop the chicken into random pieces. if you order their jerk chicken, you can get a leg, or maybe a wing, or maybe a cut of something and something else, or... who knows, it's a surprise. i've never tried ordering a specific part of the chicken, but i bet they would just look at me funny if i did.\u000a\u000abut yes, their service is extremely slow. so slow that you would think there is only one person in the back doing the work of 4 people, but i don't think that's the case. i think it's just the culture of the business they run. go prepared to stay there longer than your typical hour or so because you will be waiting. expect to repeat things multiple times to the server, who is usually very sweet but also forgetful and unattentive. if you want something, ask for it specifically. \u000a\u000ai literally sat there for 2.5 hours one time. i had decent company, so it wasn't that bad, but i was starving. i was craving their jerk sauce, so i had just to wait. if you really like a good kick, ask for their homemade hot sauce. i can take some pretty spicy things, and this one is enough to make me cringe. because it's homemade, ithe hotness does differ from time to time. \u000a\u000ai haven't tried anything else there, but if i am waiting an 45-60 mins on average for food, i want to make sure it's the best thing on the menu.

Vslow is definitely the word of the day. \u000a\u000aa group of friends and i were trying to go to the ethiopean restaurant next door but they had an hour long wait, so we walked over here.  we were in somewhat of a rush, because it was 6:30, and we needed to leave by 7:30 in order to catch a play at cmu.  when we first got in, it took them about 5 minutes to just seat us.  that should have been warning enough.\u000a\u000ait took them 15 minutes before we got to order, and by the time 7:30 rolled around, we still hadn't gotten any food.  we had asked the server about the timing a few times, but finally, we just told the server that we really had to go and walked out.\u000a\u000ai know it's not very nice to give a place 1 star when you haven't even tried the food.  for all i know, it could be phenomenal.  but seriously, i don't think it's acceptable to make people wait more than an hour for their food.  apparently, all the food is made to order, and by that, i mean they make it as you order it, instead of having some food already prepared in the back that's just waiting for the final touches or something.  so that explains the wait.

Vok, so i finally went back, and this time, i even got food!  granted, i think my friend and i were the only customers in there for the first half hour, so if there hadn't been food, they really would have had no excuse.\u000a\u000ai had a goat curry stew, which was different and good.  they don't always have sweet fried plantains, but it's good to know that they might have them, for when i get a craving.\u000a\u000aseems like take out might be a better way to go - the entire time i was there, cars kept on pulling onto the curb right in front of the restaurant, people would stumble in and stumble out, just like that.  so... maybe the better strategy is to call in your order, chill out at home for the hour it's going to take them to make it, and then just come and pick it up.

Vi came here with a group of seven girls, and that makes it very hard for restaurants to serve speedily and efficiently, but i felt like our waitress did a great job considering our group's size, the fact that it was her first day, and that she was the only server in the restaurant!\u000a\u000awe brought our own wine, which had a $2.50 fee for the bottle - it's nice when byob is free, but $2.50 split between several people is really nothing, so no biggie. she opened the wine for us and brought glasses.  i know that a few people ordered non-alcoholic drinks and did not receive them, but were initially charged for them on the check, so we had to get that fixed.  minor hassle.  we began with fried green plantains which were hot and crispy - they were served with ketchup, but when we asked if they had any other sauce, she brought us out something more flavorful to try!\u000a\u000ai think everyone like their entrees.  i know the flavor of mine was fantastic - the server recommended the bbq jerk chicken, with their homemade bbq sauce, and it really was great.  i don't think it's too spicy for anybody who can eat thai and indian food at a moderate spice level, but it does have heat so i would not recommend it to someone who can't handle that.  anyway the flavor was great, but there just....wasn't much chicken!  there were 4 pieces but it seemed to be mostly bone/connective tissue - the meat-to-bone ratio was sadly low.  the meat was so juicy, i would've loved a bigger portion, or bigger pieces of meat!  i got black beans and rice/peas for my sides.  heads up people - "rice and peas" = rice and beans, so don't go blaming the restaurant for getting your side dish wrong.  the sides were very mild in flavor, which was nice because they served to calm the palate after the spicier entree.\u000a\u000awe were there for an hour and 45 minutes before we'd all paid, so things did move a bit slowly, but we didn't really mind.  sounds like other people are saying that the restaurant is often slow, so heads up about that.  the waitress also brought our checks before asking if we wanted dessert, and i know some people wanted cake, so that might be in their best interest to fix!\u000a\u000aall in all, a tasty and authentic meal.  i would loooove to up my review to 4-stars, which i would do if i came back and got another great-tasting meal that had a larger portion!

Vi've never really been big on thai food, but the green mango is certainly a fun dining experience.  the place is very upbeat without cramming it down your throat.  it is byob but they do not charge an uncorking fee.\u000a\u000abecause i tend to like my food a little more basic (although i'm always open to new things), i like starting out with the summer rolls as an appetizer.  the consist of  leaf lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, vermicelli,  in rice paper.  the dipping sauce is homemade, and i can really taste the difference.\u000a\u000ai like to get the steamed chicken, which is simply  chicken breast, cilantro. cucumber slices, and ginger sauce.  if i'm in the mood for something a little spicier, i like the grilled chicken with basil.  that is  grilled chicken, sliced onions, bell peppers,  eggplant, and chili sauce and basil leaf.\u000a\u000afor those of you with food allergies, they will custom-order anything to your needs.  the service here is very good and the prices are very reasonable.

Vpretty solid thai food, especially on a cold day.  the restaurant is tiny and cozy, with photos on the wall that make me want to book a flight to thailand right this second.\u000a\u000aat 3:00 on a sunday afternoon, we were allowed to order off the lunch menu, which meant that a serving of vegetarian pad thai was $6.50 - and the portion was big enough that i took about half of it home.  it was one of the best pad thai's i've ever had - not too saucy, the egg was cooked well, it wasn't too peanutty or too bland... all the flavors were perfectly balanced.\u000a\u000ai thought the tofu summer rolls were a little bland, but i think that's the case everywhere and is not a complaint about green mango.  my boyfriend said his pineapple curry was worthy of four stars, a little spicier than expected but not overwhelmingly so.  my dad got the shrimp tom yum soup, which he also said was quite spicy, and the ginger chicken, which went over well.\u000a\u000ai will definitely be back on a gloomy day when i'm in need of some warm, spicy food.

Vmy girl posse and i had a sunday girl's night out and we stopped here for dinner before heading over to the regent square theatre.  i wasn't exactly in the mood for thai food, but are there no other decent places open in regent square on a sunday?  \u000a\u000afor appetizers we ordered the summer rolls, which are green leaf lettuce, mint, cilantro, basil, vermicelli, all in thin rice paper.  we had ours filled with roast duck and they were perfect on a june evening.  my main course was lemon grass chicken.  the chicken was very tender and the ginger sauce didn't overpower it.  for dessert we ordered the ginger balls, which is rolled rice flour balls stuffed with black seasame seeds.  deliciously different!\u000a\u000aso yeah, even though we came here by default, it was a pretty good choice.

Vi visited for lunch with two friends and thought it was just okay.  the service was less than ideal - they seemed to ignore a table of twenty-somethings to fawn over ladies lunching; the waitress was one who doesn't write anything down and brought me the wrong wrap; and there were occasional long delays.  our group ordered the crab cake, the penne, and the vegetable wrap, and nothing really stuck out.  my wrap and sweet potato fries were very bland.\u000a\u000adesserts were the definite upside - perfect creme brulee and raspberry cheesecake.  the restaurant is also very pretty and there is excellent people-watching.  but the food is just mediocre.

Vhas it really been almost a month since i've reviewed a restaurant in pittsburgh?? well, for shame neal m. let me remedy this directly and i couldn't have picked a much better spot than bistro 19 to begin my spring reviews.  i was here for dinner on tuesday of last week with a couple business associates.  i arrived a little after 7 pm to meet tom and mike who were seated at the bar enjoying their first cocktail.  the space itself is quite nice and intimate.  however, they seem to use the space well as to make it seem much larger than it's actual i'd guess 1,000 - 1,500 sq. ft dimension.  you enter and are greated by a large bar typcially packed with locals in casual wear and suits alike,  the interior is sparce and minimalist with high ornate ceilings and tables located throughout but not so close as to lack privacy.  the colors are dark deep browns, gold and green.  the tile columns and exposed wine rack are also a nice touch.  the bathroom is located in the back near the kitchen entrance and are large and well designed.  after a cocktail at the bar we make our way to a table in the back with a nice view of the bustling suburban street on a spring weekday.  the server greets us promptly with a big smile and reviews the features while grabbing us all another cocktail.  i'm having dirty martini rocks which are pretty good, however lacking those really big olives that i likeand most often get at steakhouses.  the meal starts with some bread and butter, meh.. then we order a couple of appetizers.  mike says he really likes the "pot stickers", so we try those and then also try the lemon pepper calamari.  the calamari is fine served very lightly breaded with some type of mayo sauce or remoulade.  the pot stickers are also adequate spiced with some type of thai sauce.  we all decide on salads instead of soups and i try the french onion soup, which was very good.  it had a much more layered flavor than many other french onion soups you get in casual spots and was well seasoned with a somehow still crunchy croute and mounds of gruyare.  tom and mike tried the soup of the day which was some type of chicken thai soup that also tasted pretty good from the small sampling i had.  it is so true that you can tell a lot about a chef by their soups and this start led me to believe the rest of the meal wouldn't let us down.  tom and mike had the chilean sea bass, which was a nice healthy serving of perfectly cooked sweet sea bass with a nice slaw and marinade.  i had the "steak and cake" which was their filet (good quality, not prime) cooked perfectly medium rare along with large perfectly cooked asparagus, mashed potatoes (forgettable) and a good crabcake.  the crabcake had almost no filler and was served with a nice mustard sauce.  this crabcake is good and almost in the same league as andora's or monterey bay's crabcake,,, almost...  we finished by splitting their version of "bananas foster",,, it was very good with a flaky crust and homemade whipped cream i'd guess.  overall this is a very good option with a warm atmosphere and good prospects in my estimation for long term success in this casual fine dining segment.

Vi really enjoyed having lunch here - the atmosphere is relaxed and the food is excellent.  we sat outside and the road noise was a little much, but if you opt for the inside, i'm sure you'll have a better experience.\u000a\u000awe both tried the watermelon soup, which was quite tasty and a great summer dish.  i had the tiger shrimps, which were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious.  i'd happily have them again.  boyfriend tried the roast beef sandwich, which was, by all accounts, delicious, but potentially a little too rich.\u000a\u000aat any rate, a real winner in my book.  i just wish that they had better outdoor seating.  i hear they have a delectable sunday brunch, so watch for an update.

Vrelatively new restaurant around the south side area in pittsburgh. this is probably not the best tapas bar in pittsburgh, but it is a good bang for your buck. my friend and i had 4 tapas, two drinks and with tips the bill came out to $50. the selection is pretty good and the food is very tasty. they have outdoor seating too, which is perfect for the nice weather we have now. if you're reading this review when the weather is bad, sorry. \u000a\u000aon to the food. recommended: stuffed grape leaves and shrimp bruschetta.\u000a\u000aif you want to spend (a lot) more money, i would suggest ibiza, of the mallorca fame.

Vi came into this place wanting to like it - i like tapas.  \u000a\u000athis place was not good.  while it has great location and an uncluttered interior, the food just does not live up to its surroundings.  in fact, you could say that the food is downright ...  not good - definitely fusion food gone wrong!  we got 6 different tapas to share amongst 4 people.  3 specials for the night and we tried 2 - the mahi with pineapple and prosciutto with chanterelle pizza.  we also got the mussels, rigatoni bolognese, flat iron steak (medium rare) and the margherita pizza.  let me just describe them like this:  tasteless and slightly overcooked; good but a little too salty; nothing special (i've had much much better); ehh; overcooked and tasteless and frankly much too overpriced for what you got.  i had to save the margherita pizza description for last --- a white cheese pizza with cold tomato sauce poured on top.  oh, with 6 pieces of basil strewn atop.  margherita??  isn't that supposed to have actual tomatoes as described on the menu?  the manager of the restaurant didn't even seem bothered by this even though she said she would "check on it".\u000a\u000aplease, save yourself from disappointment.  don't bother eating here.  \u000a\u000athis place got 2 stars because the service, decor and location were all ok.  oh, and the sangria is just ok.

Vmy first visit to this place was when it was a week old and i had drinks with the jazz guy from npr who at the time was an owner.  it's had a few owners since then several menu overalls and changes to the decor and kitchen  staff including a rehaul and redesign of the menu.  the best thing by far with this place is the space.  the lighting is warm the tables and chairs are comfortable, the bar is big and their is additional couches for lounging.  it's also a perfect summer spot with roped off outdoor seating and garage style glass doors that open up to join the indoor and outdoor seating.  our server was quite good and said she's worked there since the opening.  i'm sure she's seen a lot of drama with the changes this place has had.  i didn't care much  for the hostess who seemed a bit  upset when i said we wouldn't need menus just the wine list.  i actually had to ask her if it was okay  to take a table if we were just drinking.  she begrudginly said "i guess".  the wine selection is okay and pretty overpriced like most places.   the sangria, which they tout as their special is average at best.  the tapas that i've tried there are good, but not that interesting.  ibiza is much better.  yesterday i ordered a cheese plate which was good served with a warm banana nut bread and honey which were nice touches, however i still would have liked some crackers.  my friend ordered the chicken and sausage tapas which was great.  the chicken moist and the skin crispy.  i think they need to work a little bit on the staff and reduce their menu items, so they can specialize on perfecting a smaller amount of dishes.

Vi am very much over "tusca".  i first visited here over a year ago and have been here aboout a dozen times since and i've never had  a good experience.  the only reason i go here is because it is convenient and they have outdoor seating. yesterday's experience was the impetus to finally document and update my distaste for this place.  we get there about 130 pm prior to going to seeing the new mike judge movie. we enter and head towards the bar.  it is very muggy inside of this place, how they manage that i just don't know.  it's a relatively mild humidity day outside and feels like a costa rican airport inside.  there also is an off putting smell to the place that is a cross between some kind of industrial cleaner and something else i can't quite place..maybe the smell of broken dreams...  the bartender is so obviously uninterested and apathetic that you can feel the contempt he obviously has for the customers and the disappointment in where he finds himself.  i ask for a guinness and they don't have one nor do they suggest a suitable alternative.  annie gets a pretty awful vodka/tonic and i settle on a shiraz,,,maybe the worst glass of wine i've ever had in a restaurant.  it was just gross.  annie orders a pizza, which truthfully was edible.  i mean it was cheese, marinara and soggy crust.  i had the hot tapas steak and fries,,,which took close to an hour to receive with no apology.  the steak was okay, the fries were edible, but again i was so turned off by the atmosphere that even if the food was really good, which it wasn't i wouldn't be back.

Vthis dos is pretty great for a quick lunch when you're on campus but you don't want to eat lunch on campus, especially for habitual beckman cave people like myself.  i had the enchiladas nortenas today and have no regrets.  \u000a\u000ait does get crazy nuts busy during lunch, full of beckman faculty and grad students and other individuals who occasionally have seen the sun in the past six months. \u000a\u000ai can't really tell the difference between dos, el toro, and el torero, but this dos is at least as quick, cheap, and tasty at stuffing almost unidentifiable white cheese into various starches and serving them piping!  hot! as the other mexican restaurants in town.

Vum, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating uiuc folk like myself.  i didn't fully appreciate it when i was there. senior year, i started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty mexican food.  now, whenever i visit my campus, i return to get my fill of the deliciousness.\u000a\u000aseriously, coming from chicago, you can not get food this cheap/tasty anywhere in the city.  seriously, you can't!  i think my friends and i spent about $12 each - that's dinner for everyone, plus 1/4 of a 60 oz flavored margarita pitcher.  come on now, what a steal!\u000a\u000ait's actually pretty tasty too.  i looooove their tamales.  the bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as i bite into that familiar salsa, i melt.  the margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others.  service is usually very friendly and quick.  it's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice.  dos reales, i'll always love you.

Vnordstrom, saks and neiman marcus all in one mall! how could you go wrong? not to mention the capital grille, true religion and louis vuitton too. it doesn't hurt being across the street from wynn las vegas either. it just sucks that the bloomingdales is a home store.

Vkassab's has a really good falafel sandwich. they were very generous with the falafel serving; and, for $5.99 it was a great price for a quick, tasty meal before an evening at city theater. out of the few restaurants i've grabbed a quick bite from before heading to a show, this is perhaps my favorite. it's quick, the service is good, the prices are relatively inexpensive even for a dinner platter, and the food is tasty.\u000a\u000ait may not be an ideal location for impressing a first date before a show because the interior does resemble a nice cafeteria. personally, i wouldn't mind, but that's just cuz i'm a cheap date :)

Vi came in here for lunch on a thursday - the place was empty, which made me sad, but it meant that i got my take-out chicken shawarma sandwich very quickly.  the server was funny and friendly, and offered me a glass of water while i waited.  the sandwich came out in only a few minutes, and was big enough for me to make 2 small meals out of it.  it was hot, with seasoned chicken inside, along with lettuce, tomato, and nutty tahini sauce.  actually, i'm craving one now just thinking about it. i was surprised that they weren't more busy, given the friendly service and fresh, tasty food.  i hope to have the chance to come back soon - i'm almost never on the south side, but i'd definitely return if i was nearby again.

Vbefore i ever went in to noodles i was like "oh yeah, i get it, it's a little healthier than like chipotle or antonio's, and it has lots of noodle dishes, sounds like a good idea to me."  then i actually went for lunch one time.  there was nothing on the menu that looked at all appealing (too much broccoli in everything; i'm a hater,) so i ordered the mac 'n cheese because it was the least healthy looking option and therefore had the best chance of being tasty.  i got it with "steak" which cost like an extra $10 or some shit.  it was so expensive!  \u000a\u000amy macaroni and cheese came out, and it was so bland i put sriracha in it.  the "steak" was not worth the ridiculous $10, and was barely identifiable as any particular type of meat.\u000a\u000ait gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has air conditioning and is clean.

V4 stars for a chain pizza joint - you betcha ya.\u000a\u000ai'm pretty picky about pizza and let's face it most chains pizza is not very good. vocelli's is different, not do they different crusts to choose from they have their gourmet pizza selection which beats all other chains hands down.\u000a\u000aplus they have always been fast and after getting pies from 2 different stores they have had good consistency.

Vthe converted house restaurant is beautiful.  however, i find the food to be only average.  they have a lunch buffet, which is decent.  i was pleased with the number of vegetarian dishes and i feel that they have a wider selection of dosa than other indian restaurants in the area.\u000a\u000ahowever, overall, i feel that there are other indian restaurants that do as good as or better of a job.  plus, the food is a bit pricey.  that being said, if you want indian food, and you are on a date and want a nicely decorated restaurant to go to, not a bad place to try.

Vwhen we order indian, my boyfriend always, without fail, orders chicken tikka masala.  it looks so yummy, and i steal bites of his rice soaked in the sauce, and then i complain about how nobody offers vegetarian tikka masala.  once i tried to make tofu tikka masala.  (it sucked.)  and then!  i heard about tamarind.  and i looked at their menu online, like i always do.  and they had paneer tikka masala!  "we're going here," i decided.\u000a\u000abut i didn't even tell you the best part yet.  i almost don't want to, for fear that the next time i go it will be overrun and crowded and i'll have to wait for a table or they'll sell out of something good.  but i'll tell you.\u000a\u000aon sundays, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  an appetizer, two entrees, an order of naan, and two soft drinks.  for $25.  and their portions are huge and come with a side of mixed veggies or dal soup.  you really can't go wrong.  their menu has both north and south indian dishes so everyone can find something that sounds delicious.\u000a\u000ai thought the atmosphere was really nice and the service was really attentive and fast, unlike previous reviews.  i will definitely be back and i look forward to trying more of the menu.

Vthis is the best indian restaurant i've been to so far in pittsburgh. their buffet lunch is excellent and includes many choices, all of which are excellent. after consuming my first plate from the buffet, i returned and loaded up on all of the dishes again since they were so belly satisfying. i've also been to tamarind for dinner and the few menu options i tasted have been pleasing (and spicy).\u000a\u000ahighly recommended.

Vactual star rating 2.5 \u000a\u000abackground: indian food is probably my favorite style of food, my wife and i have have been to india on a culinary trip and we have eaten in over 100 different indian restaurants in the us over a 20 year period. so i am a little picky. \u000a\u000awe started of with a samosa - the pasty was light and flaky, very good, however the filling left much to be desired. i have never had a samosa that had shredded (think hash browns) potatoes inside of it. the traditional is a mashed potato and the hash browns were not very pleasant. however the tamarind and hari chutney were very good. \u000a\u000afor entrees we had the aloo gobi masala and the chilly chicken. the masala dish was not inedible but was not a traditional masala or even one of the many variations that i have tasted. first of all it was very yellow because way too much turmeric was put into it. secondly there was no underlying masala flavor or cumin that could be detected. it was just a bunch of turmeric, yogurt and garlic. it was edible but not what i would have called a masala dish. \u000a\u000athe chilly chicken was good but again not what i expected. this dish was more an indonesian or chinese style cooking and appeared to be flavored with sambal oelek. like i said the dish was good, but not very indian in nature. \u000a\u000athe garlic naan needed help, the base naan itself was good, but tossing raw garlic that had been sitting in lemon juice or some other sort of acid was not good. plus it appeared to have a small sprinkling of parmesan cheese on it - strange. if one wishes to top it with something why not the more traditional chopped cilantro. \u000a\u000athe mango lassi was served with ice (usually only done when it's very hot) and the masala chai was good. \u000a\u000aafter the failure at udipi and now this rather under-par experience i am beginning to wonder if the burgh has any good indian places to eat.

Vwith our groupon rapidly approaching expiration, we finally made it in to tamarind last sunday to cash it in!  it was a hot evening, but fortunately we found pretty easy parking on craig street and didn't have to walk long before we reached the renovated house that is tamarind.  we both loved the atmosphere immediately - it looks like somebody's home, with a few stained glass windows, staircases behind the kitchen, and tables by sunny windows.\u000a\u000awe made a reservation (which you need, for the groupon), and we were seated immediately.  there were quite a few other patrons dining in - definitely a popular place.  on sundays they have a deal where for $25, two people can get an appetizers, two entrees, and a side of bread.  if you have the groupon, you can't take advantage of this deal, but that's okay - you'll just have to come back another time (and trust me, you'll want to come back!)\u000a\u000awe started with waters, and i got a mango lassi - tamarind's version is sweet and refreshing, a perfect complement to the meal.  we skipped appetizers, knowing how full we get at indian restaurants, and settled on saag paneer, lamb biryani, and a side of onion naan.  we were warned that the lamb biryani was spicy, and assured our server that we could handle it.  the naan came out first - very fresh and crispy.  the flavor was mild, not very onion-y but you could see the little flecks of charred onion dotted throughout the bread.  we both inhaled our first slices, stopping only to put spoonfuls of chutney on our plate for dipping (the green one is very potent with mint flavor).\u000a\u000athe entrees were presented beautifully - i could not wait to devour them.  the saag paneer looked rich and succulent, with big heaps of cheese surrounded by vibrant spinach.  a small bowl of mild, soupy lentils accompanied the entree, as did plenty of basmati rice.  the lamb biryani arrived in a generous, heaping portion, and the smell of spices filled the table.  a cooling raita was served alongside.\u000a\u000awe agreed that the saag paneer was one of the best versions of this classic dish that we've ever had.  it was creamy, luscious, and flavorful.  it was undoubtedly a cut above the rest in terms of quality and freshness.  the biryani was also excellent, though not nearly as spicy as advertised!  we were a little disappointed about that, and joked that if the server is warning us about spice, we expect to be perspiring and reaching for water!  the taste was wonderful, rich with cardamom, and the lamb was tender and flavorful.  all around, it was better than what we've had at most indian restaurants.  these dishes that we've had dozens of times were raised to a new level by tamarind.\u000a\u000ait's not terribly expensive either, very reasonable prices considering the large portions and lovely atmosphere.  even though coriander is down the street from our apartment, we both agreed it would be worth the drive to go to tamarind next time we have a craving for indian food!

Vhmmm firehaus was nice on the inside, air conditioned, clean for a bar, espec. a campus bar.  my dining partner and i thought the firefighter photography on the wall was on the depressing side, but at least it fit the motif.  our waitress was competant, and left us alone to conduct our business.\u000a\u000amy sandwhich was $7 though, and i still had to pay extra for fries.  not crazy about that.

Vit is really hard to review a bar from your college town.  the nostalgia factor gets in the way of objectivity!  i've always liked firehaus but it was never one of my haunts.  i like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air.  they have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy.  dim lighting, very red in there.  well i guess it is a firehouse.  despite it "looking" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, i'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people.  last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom.  so you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.

Vthis is a conditional review. if you're drunk or hungover, primanti gets 5 stars. otherwise, it's an unimpressive and unwieldy sandwich. dry/vinegar cole slaw and french fries along with normal sandwich filling between two thick slices of bread is good, but it's not the transcendent sandwich food network makes it out to be.

Vyes, this is a pittsburgh staple and if you're in town you should check it out if you like artery clogging sandwiches with fries and cole slaw on it. yes! on it! look at the logo. okay, im done being a smartass. i get slightly offended when people think this is "pittsburgh's best" or a "must visit" because they seen it on tv. - those guys get paid to eat and rave about these places. long story short, its a piece of pittsburgh history...its not the greatest eatery but i think its okay. i've only had the cheese sandwich and fries with cheese sauce. the sandwich is filling...i usually take a slice of bread off and eat it open faced with a fork and the cheese sauce they use (for the side of fries) is obviously powder mixed with too much water. jb always orders the pastrami with a fried egg and he's content with it.\u000a\u000aif you're visiting pittsburgh and you want a quick, cheap bite of local histoy but aren't in the mood for anything fancy then maybe check it out. after reading these reviews this doesn't sound like your cup of tea then avoid. pittsburgh has a lot to offer when it comes to dining.

Vit's a sandwich.  a huge sandwich with fries and coleslaw on it.  \u000a\u000aprimanti's is one of those places people love or love to hate, but i'm just ok with it--i don't really think it's fair for me to give a bad review, since i'm not a big meat eater and only get the cheese.\u000a\u000ai find myself eating here once a week or so during the school year, and when i do, i don't have to eat another meal that day.  so...if you're hungry, in oakland, and haven't stopped here i would recommend giving it a shot.

Vthis isn't the original location, but that doesn't detract anything from this location.  you can tell this is a college hot spot before you even walk in there.  it is located within steps of pitt campus.  \u000a\u000ait's actually quite a small space inside, but they were able to make due with what they had.  there is a bar, some seating in the main area, and there is a small loft type of area for seating as well.  \u000a\u000aas far as the food goes, it's just like all other locations for primantis.  greasy and good.  and with most city locations, you get to watch the prepare your food in front of you.  that is one of the best things, being able to see your food being made, this way you know it's piping hot off the grill.  the staff in here at that time were very polite and made our food ordering experience a breeze.  \u000a\u000amight i add, only order extra meat if you are serious.  honestly, your appetite may be more than your stomach can handle.

Vy'know, in all the years i've worked downtown, i've never been to august henry's.  in fact, i'd barely noticed it.  i'm a non-drinker, so i have little reason to go to a place like this.  well that and places like august henry's tend to be a little pricey for everyday chow.\u000a\u000abut i took a friend of mine out for lunch today for her birthday.  she'd been here before, so she recommended it.  most bars have really good burgers and this place is no exception.  i had the saloon burger which was your typical 1/4lb burger.  the burger comes with saloon chips or for an extra buck or so, you can get the fries.  or spend an extra buck-n-a-half and get the sweet potato fries like i did.  dee-lish-us!\u000a\u000athey had a few unusual dishes here which seemed mighty tempting.  they've got a sweet potato chicken salad and a turkey burger.  but what you may not realize is that turkey burgers aren't all that healthy either and a lot of salads are actually higher in fat and calories than most burgers!  \u000a\u000aoh and then there were the loaded fries, which according to their menu is "classic french fries topped with shredded cheddar cheese, crispy bacon & jalapeos & finished with crme frache."  whoa baby!  if you're gonna eat unhealthy, might as well go all out!

Vcame here with my unit for a little pre-thanksgiving friday lunch.  august henry's is still pretty much typical bar food.  i.e.: fattening stuff to make you drink more.  \u000a\u000abut since my unit was here with the boss (me), they couldn't drink.\u000a\u000aso we began our lunches with a couple of orders of cheese wheels.  "what are 'cheese wheels'?" you may ask.  well according to the menu, they're "a trio of sliced provolone wheels, panko battered and deep-fried, covered with marinara sauce."  whoooo-hooo!   \u000a\u000anow i have to admit my crab cake salad with mixed greens with tomatoes, cucumbers and rmoulade dressing was good.  and we all know that salads are healthy, right?

Vhey, you've gotta like a sandwich place named mike & tony's!  justin's right--it's a hidden little gem for downtown diners.  they've got your basic greek chow here--gyros, greek chicken, souvlaki, baklava, etc, plus burgers, salads, and hoagies.  feeling a little adventurous, i tried one of the specials:  chicken & souvlaki with fries & beverage.  the chicken was excellent.  sometimes chicken at places like this can be dry but mine was pretty juicy.  i'd never had souvlaki before, so i have nothing to compare it to, but i did like it.\u000a\u000anot a bad meal deal for only $6.50!  and i had leftovers too!  \u000a\u000aoh and please my fellow pittsburghers.  i've known some greek people and it's not pronounced "gye-roes"!  they cringe in athens everytime you say that.  it's "yeeh-roes"!  emphasis on the "y" and a very short "s"!  i've also heard it pronounced "gee-roes!"  sharp "g"!

Vmike & tony's is definitely a great place to go to if you're looking for good, inexpensive lunch.  especially if you're looking to get out of your crazy office for awhile like i was.  i've had their specialty, chicken and souvlaki before and i've also had their gyros.  but today i was in the mood for something a little simpler.  i went for the half sized italian hoagie, which was still big enough but definitely very tasty.  paired with a small diet pop and i had a whole lunch for about 5 bucks.  and what better way to enjoy it than dining al fresco along with a good book?\u000a\u000ai'm with darren on this one.  cheap and nasty--no way.  mike and tony's has some great gyros and sandwiches.

Vi'll have to agree with the previous reviewer on the decor of this restaurant.  suffice it to say, it's not that great.  but really, people come for the drinks and tapas, right?  \u000a\u000awell, be prepared to pay.  about $10 per tapas or drink, both of which are ok, nothing to write home about.  i got the pomegranate mojito which was not much of either.  at $10, i was expecting a bit more.  same for my friend's caipirinha which was essentially lime juice - ugh.  forget a wedge of lime, try 4 wedges - a bit too much!  the food itself - ehh.  the portion sizes are tiny and overall the quality not the best.  we tried their traditional seviche (it is the name of the restaurant) - ok.  not really spicy enough.  the mojo pork - definitely not traditional (usually pulled), this was on bone and while well-cooked, fatty and where was the mojo?  the mussels and croquettas - more of the average we were beginning to expect.  \u000a\u000acrowd-wise, this was an interesting mix.  business professionals, yuppies, random people just out.  in general, an older crowd upper 30s-50s (on a friday night).  oh, and just grab a table when you come in - no formal seating.\u000a\u000anot sure i will be back here, but sure was interesting to try.

Vi miss the 80's, miami vice, etc.  seviche reminds me very much of miami vice, don johnson, crocket...   i've been to seviche several times and it's a good spot if it's not too crowded.  it's usually either my first stop or one of my last stops  if i'm staying at the westin and walking.  last night it was my 3rd stop out of about a dozen stops and our server was so nice kate i thought i'd write a review just to give her some props'.  i was there around 8 pm last night and we were able to quickly find a table even though it was relatively crowded.  i'd say the crowd for the most part is a little older than some of the other bars that i frequent, but friendly all the same.  it's going for the south beach theme and it accomplishes this with its high ceilings and art deco interior.  bright lights big windows high top tables a few couches and a large bar with another sushi type bar.  the bathrooms are nice and overall the space is very warm if a little bit cheesy.  the service is usually good when i frequent here, but last night it was stellar.  kate gave us great tips all night long and guided a very nice dining experience.  i had very deliciousl ketel one rocks dirty's most of the night and my friend had delicious mojitos'.  these mojitos are good, but for some reason i just love the ones at dish.  we had so many small plates, i'm sure i'll forget a few.  we started with an amazing blue point oyster "fire and ice" which were fresh and delicious.  the preperation is spicy with habernaro peppers red onion and a prickly pear ice topping. it really is there signature dish and i recommend you get the fire and ice preparation when you come.  it's spicy and cool with delicious fresh seafood.  we followed this up with the crab and scallop, same fire and ice preparation.  this dish is light and flavorful and melds well with a stiff cocktail.  we also tried the tuna ginger tataki, which is quick seared #1 grade ahi served with ginger fennel and some type of mayo, i'd say spiced with wasabi.  it was also quite good.  we also tried the mussels which started good, fresh and plump, but then had a few that had not so much of a fresh flavor.  overall it was a miss.  go to pointe brugge for your mussels.  we may have had another dish, but can't quite recall.  overall this is a good spot in the cultural district for an urban theme, stiff drinks, and light fresh food.

Vi am consistently amazed by how good the food is in pittsburgh.  the silk elephant is my second culinary foray into pittsburgh, and i really enjoyed my experience here.\u000a\u000athe decor is modern, but thai inspired.  most of the wait staff is caucasian, but i did see some asian people in the kitchen, so i feel like that at least makes it mildly authentic.\u000a\u000abf and i had:\u000a1.  tom yum soup - yummy!  \u000a2.  mango salad - also yummy\u000a3.  lamb chops - excellent, as long as you like thyme.\u000a4.  salmon rolls - probably our favorite\u000a5.  crab crowns - eh.  tasty, but more for the fried cream cheese in wonton concept, rather than due to any crab meat in the dish per se\u000a6.  some dumpling - can't remember, reminds me of siu mai from dim sum.  it was good, but nothing extraordinary\u000a7.  siam paragon - save your money with this one.  it's not that great.\u000a\u000aoverall, a great experience.  the server was very attentive and nice.  a lovely place to go on a date.

Vthis is a good spot that i  just happened to stumble upon on a sunday  afternoon because of an open parking spot.  it's located in squirrel hillwhere "zyng asian grille" used to be.  this is a much better choice than the tgif of asian food like zyng.  the atmosphere is colorful and warm.  the ceilings are high and the seating is plentiful.  i sat at the bar, which has a nice plasma and a better than average wine selection.  the menu is big and i think thai food is a good choice to be served tapas style.  i ordered a glass of chardonnay to start which tasted fine and wasn't too overpriced, however the bartender poured what must have been only a 3 oz. pour.  the wine comes in cocktail glasses, so perhaps it was an optical illusion that i misinterpreted.  nevertheless, i mentioned it before i ordered another glass and was given your customary 6 oz.  i started with a delicious pork and seafood dumpling, which was really tasty and almost as good as nicky's thai in verona.  next i tried the chili pepper scallops, which were cooked perfectly, but lacked much spice for what was advertised as a spicy dish.  in addition, i'd have preferred one or two big scallops instead of four little scallops.  last i tried the calamari, which were served with an interesting guacomole sauce, however the calamari and breading were flavorless and not delicate at all.  they looked like onion rings, but weren't as good.  the prices are okay, but this is definitely on the higher end of thai food costs.  overall, good place with an interesting concept that i'll visit again.

Vi took my adorable wife here on a tapas date before a late showing at the manor theater across the street. \u000a\u000awe had some strong cocktails, including a delicious ginger cooler with so much real ginger! we shared a variety of tiny plates, little spring rolls and puffs of taro. the veggie offerings were all delicious, although there were not too many to chose from. actually, i think that is a blessing in disguise because too many choices among delicious little tapas makes for some tough decision making. \u000a\u000athe atmosphere was elegant, the lighting was romantic, and the staff was attentive without being intrusive. we held hands over the table, and played footsie underneath, and ambled into the warm summer night satisfied with our food & drink. \u000a\u000athe prices are pretentious, like the presentation, but it's difficult to say it's not justified with the atmosphere & attention to detail. it's something i need to drop cash on like, once a year.

Vcontrary to previous reviews, i thought silk elephant was surprisingly affordable - maybe because we don't eat seafood.  three thai iced teas and six tapas dishes came to less than $40 before tip.\u000a\u000ai fell in love with a pumpkin curry soup, one of the specials of the evening.  if they offer this, try it - it's just spicy enough, with pepitas to add a little crunch.  the fresh rolls were a little bland, as they tend to be, but the sauce improves them.  i wasn't crazy about the steamed veggie dumplings (too gummy) and the tofu crisp was just okay.  my boyfriend really liked the chicken curry puffs and said they reminded him of samosas.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is okay - it was a little quiet, the tables are a bit too close together in the part of the restaurant near murray avenue, and that part of the restaurant is also very drafty.  it was surprisingly casual - lots of baseball hats and jeans.\u000a\u000ai would recommend bangkok balcony if you're starving, but silk elephant if you're just in the mood for a snack and a drink.

Vi would definitely go here again - nice atmosphere and excellent food. the menu is similar to bankok balcony which is just around the corner and also an excellent choice. had wonton soup, a noodle dish, and a curry all of which were excellent.

Vwe went early for a spot of lunch and there was one other table seated however, the wait seemed to take forever. forever to get drinks, forever to get our order taken, forever for the food to arrive, the waitress made us feel like we were a burden. the food was good but not good enough to make up for the inexcusable service provided.

Vup in squirrel hill, there are two thai restaurants: bangkok balcony and its younger more 'hip' sister restaurant, silk elephant. thai places aren't usually on my restaurant rotation so usually i end only end up visiting them for special occasions (birthdays, etc.). but one fateful day, the groupon of the day was 30 bucks for $60 at silk elephant. i realized it's been a while since i've returned, so i decided to make a return trip.\u000a\u000ain case you're not familiar with how groupon works, you basically get to buy a gift certificate to a restaurant or service for half the face value (sometimes less!). my friend and i underestimated the cost of dishes at silk elephant (too many visits to tamari makes you forget not every tapas place in the world costs an arm and leg) and ended up proceeding to order 4 tapas in addition to main entrees and drinks to get to the $60 mark (i'm missing some pics b/c we were too busy nom-ing on food and getting tipsy; our drinks ended up bringing us well over $60, oops haha). no, we didn't finish everything, and during the entire meal various other tables kept looking over at the masses of food that appeared on our table.\u000a\u000aanyways, overall the food is generally good; i want to say their curries and noodle dishes are almost identical to bangkok balcony (which would make sense being sister restaurants). if you choose to go the tapas route (which i personally wouldn't recommend unless you're sharing with a companion so you can also get or split an entree), i'd have to say their lamb rack is my favorite altogether: cooked well (happens rarely, but sometimes a little bit overcooked, but i'm extremely picky), nice sauce pairing and just a large enough portion for you to savor it without it being overwhelming or filling you up. i'm not too fond of the rolls, but everyone else i know seems to like them.\u000a\u000awith main entrees, the curries and noodle dishes are what you would expect; i like my curries to have a bit more spice and dimension to them, but my palate is probably different from your average diner. if you're a spicehead, you probably know what i mean when i say it's difficult to get dishes as hot as you want... =/\u000a\u000aoverall i'd say 3.5 stars for the food, but i'll round up because the ambiance is nice, service is always excellent, and they have a decent bar.

Vsilk elephant is our go-to restaurant when we have visitors, or when we're feeling a little fancy but don't want to venture outside of sq hill.  i love their signature cocktails like the asian pear martini & the ginger cooler.  the duck dishes are to die for, as are the thai crab crowns and dumplings.  my husbands loves getting the whole flash-fried fish.  \u000ai wish the cocktails and tapas were a little less expensive, but their cost is on par with similar restaurants.  reservations will generally make your life easier, but are not required.

Vmy husband and i were in the mood for something a little bit different and so we tried some thai food.  silk elephant is somewhat unique in  that they're a tapas style restaurant.  we began our dinners with some soup.  i tried the lemongrass and believe me, if you like chinese hot & sour soup, you'll love this.\u000a\u000afor our main courses, rick tried the tapas menu, sampling just about everything, or so it seemed.  me, i went for the basil duck topped with snow peas, carrots, and mushrooms.  i haven't had much duck in my life.  duck is very sweet and if not done properly, it can be very greasy.  mine was just perfect, however.  \u000a\u000asilk elephant also appears to have an extensive bar.  i'm a nondrinker, but rick availed himself of an asian pear martini.  service is great here too and the atmosphere is quite relaxed.  if you need an introduction to thai food, silk elephant is the place to go.

Vi am happy that pittsburgh has at least one ethiopian restaurant.  i am a little biased in terms of the food as i have been to multiple ethiopian restaurants in washington, d.c., considered one of the best cities for ethiopian food.  abay is decent.  nothing really special, but decent, good food.  for those who don't want to sit traditionally, there are tables and chairs in the back.

Vi am not an expert on ethiopian cuisine, have only eaten in about 5 ethiopian restaurants and all of them were over 5 years ago. with that said i can tell you that we had a  good dining experience, yet it was expensive for what we received, imho, the most expensive and least value of any dining experience we had while visiting pittsburgh.\u000a\u000afirst off the major gripe, i know of no other ethiopian restaurant that charges for extra injera. that was an insult on top of the very high prices.\u000a\u000awe started with the beef sambussa which was a pasty stuffed with ground beef. it was okay but not very flavorful, would order something different next time.\u000a\u000afor entrees we tried the sampler platters. the doro wat, chicken drumsticks in lemon were good but needed more berberer, the doro michet abish was much better, zilzil tibs very good and the fosolia was excellent and the beet dish was good.\u000a\u000aoverall i think the dining experience was okay, but i have been to better and less expensive.

Vabay is the perfect example of my claim that surprising, pittsburgh has really good ethnic foods! if you've never had ethiopian food and you enjoy immersing yourself in culinary exploration, abay is a great place to pop your ethiopian cherry. that is if marcus samuelsson doesn't get to you first.\u000a\u000akeep it up, abay and pittsburgh! i miss you. \u000a\u000a------------------------------\u000a\u000aon a personal note, writing reviews for pittsburgh makes me nostalgic of my wonderful times there. since leaving that city, i've lost at least 5 pounds.

Vmmmmm...best pumpkin soup ever! the african spices pay wonderful homage to my favorite gourd. i have sampled pumpkin soup at many other restaurants (when i see it on the menu i can't resist ordering it) but so far nothing has really come close to abay. in other news...jb and had the vegetarian sampler for 2, the injera was soft and spongy, perfect for collecting all of the delectable juices from our 4 mini course selections. (it's been awhile so i can't recall which ones we ordered, but i do remember them all being packed with flavor and spice and all being very tasty). \u000a\u000ai'm not a fan of eating things with my hands (i eat sandwiches and pizza with utensils...i know, i'm peculiar but i don't like to be messy). abay is different, i loved the experience of ripping into the injera and scooping the food. the experience could be quite sexy if you ask me.

Vafter eating at abay, i've now had dinner at all the ethiopian restaurants in pittsburgh!  which seems like a big accomplishment, until you learn that there are only two of them.  wah waaaah.  diversity fail.  but in any case, my boyfriend requested ethiopian food for his birthday dinner, so off to abay we went on a tuesday around 6.  the restaurant was about half full, and we chose one of the tables near the front - and by table, i mean the more authentic looking backless stools.  less comfortable, but also more awesome.\u000a\u000awe didn't bring alcohol since we were recovering from some mild illness, but he got a ginger beer (bottled, the same brand you buy at trader joe's), and i got a "yekemem shai" which was essentially chai tea.  i got it over ice, and it was tasty, but not terribly strongly brewed.   i think i'd prefer it hot next time - the ice may have watered it down too much.  we also split the carrot-ginger soup appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  it had a lovely texture, and a sweet, bright flavor.  luscious.\u000a\u000amoving on, we shared a combination platter - $28 for two people if you get a mix of meat/vegetarian.  we got to choose 4 entrees for the platter, and they were kay wat (beef with berbere), doro tibs (chicken with awaze), ayib be gomen (collard greens and cheese) and shiro wat (spicy chickpeas, lentils, and split peas).  all were good, some were standouts - the flavor of the beef was excellent, and i also really enjoyed the creamy lentils/peas.  my boyfriend loved everything, and was impressed by the authenticity of the flavor.  we both wished the portions were larger - we've been to restaurants where for the same price, you either get larger portions or more options for the platter (6 small portions instead of 4 small portions).  but honestly, with the injera, the combo plate will really fill you up.  it doesn't look like much food, but we were stuffed.  i'd recommend the kay wat and the shiro wat for sure, but nothing we had was bad.  all very satisfying, served quickly and served hot.  \u000a\u000aso far, abay wins my pittsburgh ethiopian food comparison contest, but in fairness, when i went to tana i was in a group of 12 and the kitchen was totally surprised and overwhelmed.  i'll need to try them both again to be sure, but so far abay wins this round!\u000a\u000afyi they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more, and street parking can be a challenge.  we got lucky finding a free spot right across highland, but most people will probably have to find a meter somewhere.

Vi visited with my family for an early dinner on saturday and was very impressed.  we were the only ones there so early, and only one other guest arrived while we were eating, so i would say that reservations are not necessary until later in the evening.\u000a\u000awe started with a platter of three hummuses - sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive, and black bean, accompanied with triangles of pita and some fresh veggies.  the sun-dried tomato hummus was by far our favorite, but the others were delicious as well.\u000a\u000ai ordered the spanikopite platter, which came with some steamed veggies and a side of tzaziki sauce.  it was a little on the dry side, but otherwise very good.  other dishes ordered in our group included the eggplant caprese-style, the morrocan green olive chicken, and a special of bay scallops and linguini in chimichurri sauce.  the eggplant was deliciously breaded without being greasy; the morrocan chicken and side of couscous had a delicious cumin flavor, and the scallops and chimichurri sauce were great.  the portions were large; we all asked for boxes and were disappointed that we couldn't sample their homemade desserts.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is definitely the star of the restaurant.  ethnic music, brightly colored walls, and religious art all make for a unique dining experience.  the owner is friendly and greeted us, and was even helpful in finding out the name of the cd we listened to while dining.  the waiter was friendly and labelled our take-out containers with the name of the dish and the date to avoid spoiling.\u000a\u000ai would definitely recommend the gypsy cafe - not only is the food delicious, the decor will provide a memorable talking point.

Vvisited in april with my family and boyfriend.  again, the atmosphere and service were nice, but my spanakeftedes were so dry they were basically inedible, even with the accompanying tzatziki sauce, and the cacik on the side was not impressive either.  i still do really like the atmosphere and i want to like the food but the fact that my dishes have been too dry on both visits means that i don't know how many more chances i'm willing to give.

Vgypsy cafe has a really different atmosphere for a restaurant. the tables seem out of place because you walk in and would expect this place to be something else. but, it does make the restaurant a little more homey with a cool personality. i think of it as a rich person's huge living room with a bar along the back, lots of artwork around, and neat decorations to set the mediterranean tone. \u000a\u000athe food is ok. i've been twice and both times i've been satisfied but not blown away. it's nothing i would remember and rave about a week later, but it's enough for me to enjoy it at the time. i had the sweet potato and pumpkin gnocchi, which had a delicious, mushy texture. after a few bites, i could really taste the pumpkin and sweet potato in each piece. i did enjoy it. the serving size is not very big, but enough for me. i tasted the other dishes on my table - the hummus platter was decent. the garlic hummus was my favorite, the pumpkin hummus was fun to try but not very tasty, and the lemon hummus was eh. the ajvar was good too, kind of like an eggplant salsa. \u000a\u000aall in all, i think their menu is promising, but the food itself leaves a lot to be desired. still, it seems like a popular place for those people who have found it in its tucked-away location.

Vhomestyle food with an interesting atmosphere, in the city proper.\u000a\u000awent for their special halloween themed ghost stories, and was incredibly impressed by the storyteller.  one person had something excellent, one person had something mediocre, mine felt somewhere in between; i got the post roast, and it was solid.\u000a\u000a--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aedit on this one, two years later.  i've been back half a dozen times, and five star homestyle food every time.  if i want a filling breakfast or a great place to go with friends or family, this is always on the list.  aces.

Vgypsy cafe is certainly an eclectic place.  it's menu advertises itself as a seasonal journey through europe.  my cousin and i stopped here for dinner because we were going to a concert at the nearby wyep community broadcast center.  we needed to get there early in order to get good seats and we didn't want the usual bar food so common around here.  one good thing is if you tell 'em you're going to a nearby show, they'll try and get you served asap.  \u000a\u000ait seems like this place is more concerned with the atmosphere than the actual food.  still the food here is very good.  we started off our meal with some saganaki.  i don't get saganaki very often, but this was good.  so feeling a little adventurous, i tried the szekely gulyas (and yeah, i had to look up on their website to spell that).  now what that is is a pork stew in hot and sweet paprika sauce with 'kraut and sour cream over noodles.  i've gotta tell ya, it's not something you eat everyday!

Vthis is definitely a good pick for budget-minded students looking for sushi or korean food.  the restaurant itself is tiny, but the bright colors and big windows of the upstairs dining room help open it up visually.  service was not super fast but the food was pretty good.  $5.25 gets you 12 vegetarian sushi rolls (i chose 6 avocado & 6 cucumber, but you can also get carrot.)  my boyfriend got the $7.50 bulgogi bento and i was amazed at the amount of food: side salad, pickles, 2 dumplings, a cold noodle salad, and plenty of beef and rice.\u000a\u000athere are not too many vegetarian options so it probably won't be someplace i visit often, but the sushi was pretty good and we got a lot of food for about $15.  and there are coupons on their website, so make sure you print them off before you go!

Voishii bento offers korean and japanese offerings, i have only sampled the korean dishes.\u000a\u000acheap, delicious, and fast.  there is nothing else one can really ask for.  i've sampled their spicy pork bulgogi bento/bowl and their galbi bento, and both are delicious.  all the meat options are made to order.  bowls come with the dish on top of rice while bentos also include pickled yellow radish, kyoza's (korean fried dumplings), japchae, and the choice of a basic salad (iceberg) with peanut sauce or kimchi.  an entire meal runs for around $10 tops, and the average wait is definitely less than 10 minutes.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended.

Vdelicious california rolls made right in front of your eyes, and aloe chunk juice in cans.  what more could a person want?! seriously, this place serves quality fresh food - only drawback is the (sometimes) long wait. try the ocean roll, rainbow roll, or california roll and a seaweed salad.

Vi'm a fan of oishii! it's quick and easy on the wallet, great for a quick dinner or lunch. the place itself is small and it looks like there's nowhere to sit but they have a whole upstairs area with tables and cushion-seat counter. \u000a\u000ai got a bulgogi bento box here that came with a miso soup and sides of kimchi, pickled radish and glass noodles - all for under $10! we also got a spicy tuna roll, it still wasn't spicy and the rice wasn't very packed but for being $4 or so, i wasn't complaining.

Voishii gets an extra star for cleanliness which is a rarity among oakland's eateries. i've never had the sushi but the tempura vegetables are excellent, fried to lightly golden perfection and not greasy. i love that they offer miso soup (only $1!!! ). i only wish the portions of kimchi were a little bigger, but again - it's also only $1.

Vthis is my go to sushi place in pittsburgh -- it's reasonably priced, and the food quality is high. i've been coming here for years, and actually prefer it to all but the priciest sushi places in town. i'd recommend the red heat roll, caterpillar roll, california rolls, unagi bowl, and spicy pork bowl. i pretty much bounce around those options with some inari thrown in once in a while. they also have great party platters which are a good deal for three or more people.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is with the wasteful takeout packaging which is used (to a lesser extent) even for eat in meals. lots of plastic and, if you eat in, styrofoam goes to waste. i'd love to see actual dishes, or at least more thought put in to how much packaging is really required. how about adding a recycling bin at the minimum?

Vit was a warm early summer night and annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that i have been meaning to visit since it's opening, but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity.  however, after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party i'd renewed my urgency for visiting.  the restaurant is located on s. braddock ave. in regent square.  i used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since (d's six pags and dogz for example, but i'll save that review for another time).  this is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining, independant flick at regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs.  legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here.  we weren't able to sit outside, but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room.  it is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about "hedge funds", so it was a little too close for comfort.  i think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops.  the floors are hardwood and i like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art.  these folks also get the details as i noticed with the silverware they were using (i think "toast!" uses the same type of simple ornate silverware).  a couple other non food details... it's byob for a small corkage fee of $3.  many other spots charge $10.  you can feel comfy in jeans, flip flops, or a suit and i noticed all forms of attire and all ages.  these folks are totally ingredient driven and i'm sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability.  they change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair.  okay, onto the food.  we started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter.  our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  i started with the tuna tartar. it was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish.  it was okay, i mean it didn't blow me away, but was perfectly acceptable.  however, i have to admit i've had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or "bright" flavor if you will at other places.  again, it was fine just not 5 stars.  annie tried the buttermilk soup with bulger, chickpeas and parsley.  unfortunately, annie didn't know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go.  i tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn't my thing either.  i get what he was going for i think.  it was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy.  it had a very layered flavor and i noticed many different spices most notably curry.  i had the steak for my entree and i think it was served with mashed potatoes.  it was cooked perfectly, delicious and flavorful.  the mashed potatoes were also really good. i don't think i want to know how much cream and butter is used.  for me the steak was the first thing i had that i really liked here.  annie had their famous "chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes".  i really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular.  the chicken was moist and i prefer this than to just boring chicken breast.  the skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good.  we skipped dessert, however i think next time we'll definitely try them.  one last thing the waitress noticed annie didn't eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill.  this place is quite good and probably deserves 3.5 stars.  i hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star.

Vlegume is a small restaurant up in regent square that serves up extremely tasty food in a not so formal setting.  their menu changes daily depending on ingredients the chef can get his hands on.  the chef is from maine originally and thus is a stickler to high quality seafood; the restaurant actually gets all their seafood shipped directly from the suppliers instead of through distributers.\u000a\u000ai've tried their duck confit and pate as appetizers.  i was originally surprised to see duck confit listed, as it's not a dish i have run across in pittsburgh ever (if you know where i can get it, let me know!).  both appetizers are definitely worth having again.\u000a\u000ai've tried their lamb chops; perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare.  their cassoulet is rich and hearty and perfect for the cold winter months.  the proteins they use are sausage, pork, and duck confit along with the beans of course.  the flavors were rich, but it was a tad too salty for me, and my palate already prefers the food i eat to be heavily seasoned.\u000a\u000athey do take reservations now, so that's always a good thing.  they're also byob ($4 corkage).  and every now and then they have special events for special occasions, so definitely be on the lookout for those as well.

Vthe food here is actually damn good, and while you can probably guess from the price, you can't guess from the decor; it's a tiny place, and it's *loud* in there, as it's hard walls and a hard ceiling with close together tables.  for what they're charging and the food they're serving, it seems like - generically - they might be better served by a slightly larger location.\u000a\u000aplates are small, entree portions are good, portions of sides are about half of what i'd normally expect; i really like sides more than entrees, so i was put off by the tiny plates of sides.  would probably spend more and order an additional side on my next trip in.  i like *eating* food, not just looking at it.\u000a\u000aonly thing that really knocked it off of five stars was our waiter; he seemed condescending to both of us, although we didn't mention that to each other until it came up in conversation the next day.  (you thought that guy was kind of uninterested and rude?  i did too!)

Vif you are a fan of legume in the previous location, you should definitely experience the restaurant in their new digs.  there is a wonderful spaciousness, plus the same attention to detail.  really great food with a farm to table sensibility, creativity, and delicious food.  the other thing that is new is a fabulous wine list with lots of great and surprising choices.  highly recommended.

V*for the bar\u000a\u000alegume is a spot that i haven't been to since it was a tiny affair in regent square. wild success bought them a much larger space in north oakland, amid cheap college housing and pittsburgh culinary staples like lulu's noodles, this might have seemed like a strange move to make. so strange to me, in fact, that i let legume slip silently from my mind and never considered it again, until recently.\u000a\u000asearching and re-searching yelp for some restaurant or unique feature that i may have missed on the last pass, as i often do, i happened to stumble across the fact that this new-and-improved legume had a bar! aptly named, the full service bar is open from 4p-midnight, and offers not only a solid beer and wine selection, but a fair selection of small bar-bites from the kitchen, which is also open until midnight. honestly, though, i can go anywhere in town to grab a beer and a bite - what drew me in was that they not only have a 4p-6p happy hour, but a 10p-midnight happy hour as well! that's right, stop in for skillfully crafted bar food and discount drinks, specifically $2 off drafts, $4 wines, and $5 well drinks - along with some weekly specials(ie, $5 punch on monday) and live music/djs(i think zombo plays tuesdays)\u000a\u000awe arrived at about half-past 10 and legume itself had already closed, but the bar has a separate entrance in the entryway. the bar is beautiful, lined with comfortable leather-backed barstools, a high-table with a wooden alcove, and dimly lit by candles and sconces on the wall. in the back are a few low 4-seat tables with leather chairs to have a group of people sit. the bartender greeted us quickly and handed us a cocktail and draft list, along with a bar menu. the menu has about 6-8 small plates, a few soup/salads, and 3-4 dessert options. the draft list was decent, however 2 slots of their 10 choices were wasted on miller lite and america's oldest brewery(yuengling). the bartender was happy, though, to give us samples of duck-rabbit doppelbock and southern tier's 2x stout(she was also nice to our fellow patrons, giving them a whirlwind tour of the finer points of gin and a quick intro to mezcal). \u000a\u000amy girlfriend stuck to her 2x($4), while i wound up with a standard manhattan, which turned out to not be part of the $5 well drinks(it was $8), but the bartender let me slide since she wasn't aware until after it was made. we also settled on an order or risotto balls($4) - coming 8 to a set(think lindt truffle-sized) with a small ramekin of something that seemed an awful lot like citrusy mayo, but it was dark enough in the bar that i could pretend to uphold my diet by not asking. the risotto balls were very crispy on the outside and the inside was creamy and delicious - definitely a nice alternative to french fries. \u000a\u000ahaving finished our risotto balls but not our drinks, we also ordered the crostini with chvre and pepper jelly($4) - a kitchen open as late as the bar is such an overlooked luxury! they arrived quickly, 4 slices of toasted bread completely overloaded with goat cheese, and a dollop of sweet and spicy heaven on top of each. the cool and creamy goat cheese really paired well with the flavor of the jelly, and the jelly itself was so good i grabbed every last bit i could from the plate.\u000a\u000ai still have yet to try the restaurant portion of legume, but the bar has certainly won me as a late-night regular, especially on a low-key but classy evening. also, they have their own twitter @fullservicebar, so be sure to keep up!

Vin my opinion, this is one of the top five restaurants in pittsburgh. not only is the food delicious, but the atmosphere is laid-back and the waitstaff are extremely friendly and not pretentious. the last time i went here i even wore shorts and flip-flops and didn't feel out of place, and they were very accommodating towards the four-month-old baby who was with our group. \u000a\u000ai've been here twice for wonderful three hour-long dinners with appetizers, entres, wine, dessert, and dessert wine. highly recommended; although it's not cheap, you will feel like you got your money's worth.

Vi feel bad about updating a review in the negative direction about an old friend (i believe my previous review is saved from their old location), but i figured that honesty is a good policy. despite loving legume for many years, the past year or so, i have sometimes felt disappointed with them. \u000a\u000athe chocolate truffle cake is still divine. most of the appetizers are also incredible. but they have simply not been hitting it out of the ballpark in terms of the entrees. i've been several times now where i've 1) not been particularly excited about the options available, and 2) thought the entrees were simply ok, but not stellar. the fish entrees, for example, are fine, but not wow. so goes for the vegetarian options too. and, because legume sources their meat locally, i feel licensed to eat meat there when i go. the last time i was there, they were serving jamison lamb, which i know is very high quality. the server warned me that they did not trim the meat, so that i would have to deal with gristle and such, but woah. that leg was nigh inedible. i don't usually have a problem with having to work for my food, but the amount of work i had to put in, for the payoff, was not proportionate.\u000a\u000adon't get me wrong - i'll keep on coming back to legume, but it will probably not be the first option that comes to mind from now on.

Vi had breakfast here a couple weeks ago on a sunday around 1030 am.  the weather was nice and the line wasn't that long i thought.  i think we waited about 20 minutes.  this was my first visit to this location and i can say that this location is probably my favorite.  i like the art deco feel and all the old pictures on the wall and i find this location especially "bright".  here's what i really like about pamelas.  i like the fact that you get your own pot of coffee on your table.  i like that the staff always seems friendly.  i think there pancakes are my favorite in the city.  i'm old school, so i don't throw on any whipped cream or other accompaniments (sp?).  i like just butter and tons of syrup.  i am not a fan of really fluffy or really thin (crepe) pancakes. i'd describe these as "crepe like" finding the perfect balance for me.  i also like the crispy edges on the pancakes.  i like that the orange juice is served in an adult size glass.  now, they should improve on the following right away.  the bacon is crap... i mean worse than the stuff you get on your bacon egg n cheese biscuit at mickey d's.  they don't do poached eggs (my favorite).  they don't have skim milk (i know it's like ordering diet coke with a whopper, but i gotta save calories somewhere)    i ordered the "morning after", which is two pancakes (delish), bacon (next time i'll get ham or sausage) and two eggs (no poacching as previously mentioend) and a side of corned beef hash.  i was very pleased with this.  it almsot tasted dare i say healthy.  it wasn't smashed up corned beefish type out of a can.  it was good quality corned beef diced with perfectly crisped not soggy hash browns.  annie got a cheese omelet that was huuuuge (a la paris hilton's new saying).  she said it was great and certainly looked very good, however i simply couldn't bring myself to try it.  don't forget they only take cash.

Vpros:\u000a- extensive mexican beer list, plus drafts, imports and domestics.\u000a- three beers, a soda, and three entrees cost $53.\u000a- portions are big.\u000a- the server was really friendly and the atmosphere was pretty nice.\u000a\u000acons:\u000a- the breading on the chiles rellenos tasted distinctly italian and the sauce tasted like marinara.  the owner/manager looked italian... but that's no excuse.  it wasn't bad, just weird.\u000a- after the first basket of chips and dish of salsa, they charge for refills.  only $1 per basket of chips and $0.95 for a dish of salsa, but still annoying.\u000a- once we finished our food, service got noticeably slower and we had to wait and wait for our waitress to take our check and get change.\u000a\u000adelivery available through www.wheeldeliver.net but i think the menu on their website is a little outdated.  not the best mexican food i've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  it is definitely more authentic than taco bell or don pablo's (there is tongue on the menu, how much realer does it get?)  i will probably be back.

Vthis is the only mexican restaurant i've yet to see in pittsburgh, but it gets the job done.  the interior is weird and dark, and the bar is cluttered with random crap so you can't sit there.  significant portions of the dining area were also cluttered with empty beer and liquor boxes, and this preponderance of clutter made me wonder about the kitchen.  the service was fine, friendly.  the food really isn't that bad.  it's barrio mexican, which is my favorite.  word to the wise: when they say something comes with beef, they mean ground beef.  you have to ask for steak.  for example, the $11 big quesadilla with beef is a disgusting tortilla shoved full of ground beef and cheese.  you have to request sliced beef.

Vi tried the chiles rellenos again and the covering and sauces were both normal this time.  since chiles rellenos are my favorite, and they've learned how to make them right in the past 7 months, they get an extra star.  however, they jacked up the prices and 2 chiles rellenos with rice and beans now costs an absurd $14.50.  the food's good but entirely too expensive.

Vterrible experience there today. i got our food to go, and it was packaged improperly. refried beans got all over everything-- everything in the same bag and my vehicle. the lettuce on the tacos de carne asada was cooked, and the chorizo cheese dip was atrocious. the container was quite literally half filled with orange grease. it was disgusting. it's sitting, uneaten, on my counter right now, and i paid $4 for said dip.  finally, most of the food was too salty to eat.  i was never head-over-hills for this place, but now i will never go again.

Vi really enjoy the tortilla soup, it's pretty simplistic but oh so tasty. i usually order off of the a la carte menu - i'm a huge fan of stuffed pablano peppers sometimes they're overly greasy, but other times they are done just right...i will admit that this place lacks consistency but the personable staff, chill atmosphere, and the chihuahua cheese keep us coming back.

Vthere's a few cuzamils in every city - simple restaurants with very predictable mexican food.  there's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing particularly exciting about it either.\u000a\u000awe were trying to go to sababa, but it was closed for passover, so we ducked in to cuzamil instead.  the interior is very simple - some decorative items and a tv.  i didn't see any booths, only tables.  our server was really friendly and generally cheerful, so that was a big place.\u000a\u000ashe recommended the poblanos chiles rellenos, which i tried.  they were pretty much what i expected - served very hot, with gooey cheese.  the chicken was surprisingly good and pretty tender.  the rice and beans on the side were hot.  our server got us some hot sauce which was much needed, as the dishes themselves didn't seem to have too much spice.  my boyfriend got the chimichanga, which he enjoyed.  the food was heavy, saucy, and cheesy - just what you expect from most mexican-american restaurants.  prices were a bit higher than i'd hoped - the food is fine, but also uninspired and leaves a brick feeling in your tummy.\u000a\u000achips and salsa were pretty plain too - the salsa was sort of saucy, lacking the tasty tomato and pepper chunks that normally give it texture.  margaritas tasted okay but were very weak - i didn't even feel a buzz, which was a bummer!\u000a\u000ai'll give it three stars since the server was so nice, and there was nothing wrong with the food, it was pretty much average across the board.  it's a good place to have in the neighborhood if you get a mexican craving.  still, it's places like this that make me long for the taquerias and fresh, authentic mexican food you can find in chicago.

Vso, i used to think this place was reasonable.  being from california, i've missed good mexican food so much that i sometimes find myself saying things like, "maybe chipotle really isn't that bad..." or things like that.  and for a while, cuzamil kept me from tearing my hair out when all i wanted was some greasy, hole in the wall mexican food.  cuz when i say i want mexican, that's what i want - not the fresh ingredient gourmet stuff that they serve at cantina, but the greasy spoon stuff that is dirt cheap and is essentially what you are craving after a good night out on the town.  i'm not talking foodie stuff here.\u000a\u000aanyway, so cuzamil used to satisfy that for me.  but i went recently and man was that pretty bad.  i ordered the enchiladas especiales, which were supposed to come with avocado salad (which is really the only reason i got it).  what i got were two enchiladas that were gooey, tasteless, the tortilla was chewy and clearly stale... and no avocado salad.  i asked about it, and the server came back and said they didn't have any avocado.  so... lemme get this straight.  you don't have a major ingredient, and you're not going to ask the patron if they want to change their order?  and you're going to charge them as though they got the entree they wanted, rather than two lifeless enchiladas, which are much cheaper?  someone's business radar was clearly broken.\u000a\u000aso, sure i'm a little bitter.  but given that i wasn't super hot on this place before, this little incident ensures that i'm not going back again.

Vi'm surprised this restaurant has gotten such a low rating! my brother and i came here for a late lunch and the food was hot and very well seasoned. i can't remember what my brother ordered, but i got one of the combination platters. i enjoyed my taco. i sampled the other food on my plate, which was also good but the taco filled me up and i took the rest home. service was great and i recommend coming here for good mexican food.

Vi have been to the red room multiple times for both dinner as well as just lounging late at night as a bar/hang out.  \u000a\u000awhat really draws me to this establishment is the fact that in pittsburgh, which hasn't really yet joined the rest of america's larger cities in becoming smoke free, this is a gem of place - smoke free!!!!  \u000a\u000ait's interesting to note that the place is very hit or miss in terms of the number of people that come out to play at this restaurant/bar/lounge.  in the immortal words of my sister's boyfriend, "sometimes this place is poppin' bee-yotch!  and sometimes it's not!"  :d\u000a\u000afirst, this ambiance/decor is very cool.  in one area, there are lots of comfy couches for people to relax and socialize.  of course, there is the bar itself, and then there is the restaurant area.  so, whatever you happen to be in the mood for, you can get.  \u000a\u000athe restaurant has an excellent menu, but it is a bit pricey.  this is definitely a place that you have to go to knowing you will be spending some $$$.  in terms of the appetizers, i highly recommend the seared beef tenderloin and toasted brioche with blue cheese port fondue ($13) - this is always a perennial fave with everyone who has tried it.  i have tried a number of their entrees and specials and really haven't had a bad one yet.  but the entrees will run you $20-40.  and save room for dessert - the bread pudding is so great.  anyone who knows this place knows that it used to be even better (if you can believe it) but even in its new form, still a dessert to plan on getting.\u000a\u000adrinks - they always have a nice by the glass wine selection.  and the wine bottles aren't too expensive, depending on what you choose.  the martinis are great - try the south beach.  it will seriously knock you out after 1 or 5.  :d  and i don't say that from experience.  ;)  the expresso martini is also a good choice - if you want to stay up all night.\u000a\u000aoverall, i love this place.  try it if you get a chance!  and remember, if the first time isn't quite what you were expecting, give it another try.

Vunderwhelmed, yes i'd say this word sums up my experience.  however, i will expand.  we were here last night for dinner and i was a bit disappointed to find chef kevin souza who just arrived here weeks ago has now moved on again to nine on nine (3rd move this summer for this talented chef).  the space is very nice.  it is full of deep reds which automatically relax and a nice dining area.  the bar next to the dining area is a little bizarre because the seats are too low to the ground and force you to feel like your sitting at the kiddies table with you barely able to put your elbows on the bar.  i asked about the ackward seating and was told it has to do with them buying a bar that was too tall and insurance issues on getting properly fitted seating.  they have great big leather seats for lounging with your cocktails which are a nice touch.  they've also recently added outdoor and rooftop seating which is great on a warm autumn day.  the service was a little below average.  we had a very unenthusiastic chap named mick who didn't commit any major faux pas, but it was clear this was not were he wanted to be.  the wine selection is okay.  they have a few more expensive interesting options, but the waiter didn't offer any suggestions or seemed trained at all on the description of the bottles.  the bread was okay. i'm guessing breadworks bread served with this interesting pomogranite and onion butter.  the flavors worked okay for the butter, but i would have been more pleased if the butter and bread were served warm.  i ordered the salmon tartare which had a nice flavor seasoned with cilantro and mango, however the fish itself was a little warmer than room temperature.  this is not good for tartare. it should be served slightly chilled.  fiona had the scallop appetizer which was served on this extremely bland breadcrumb type pancake.  the scallop itself was delicious and cooked perfectly however for $12 i think one deserves more than one average sized scallop.  i had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and very flavorful, however the greens that accompanied were bland.  they don't put salt and pepper on the tables which is okay and i've been to other fine dining where this occurs.  however, if they won't provide the flavor enhancers they should be spot on with the seasoning.  red room is not.  fiona had the strip steak which was $42. this seems a bit much for strip.  it was very fatty and had a weird chemical flavor. i'm guessing from a charcoal bricket.  it was edible, but i've had better steaks at tgif.  we skipped dessert.  the bill including tip was $180.  this place is overpriced for the quality of food and serving size.  i'd be okay paying this cost if i was trying something unique like i was hoping for with chef souza, however they have re employed an old sous chef who is now doing the cooking and in my opinion does not justify the cost.  it's a shame because i'm sure they've put a lot of money in overhauling the restaurant, but this won't be a top notch restaurant until they get better talent in the kitchen or reduce their prices.  this place probably deserves 2.5 stars.

Vi really enjoyed my meal at red room.  very unassuming from the outside, which seems to be the way of things in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000ai started with a salad... can't quite remember which one it was, except that it was good.  i also had the strip steak, which was excellent.  i didn't particularly care for the pickled veggies on the side, but if i stayed away from that, then it was fine.  we had the bread pudding for dessert, which was divine.  i'd come back just for that.\u000a\u000aatmosphere is dark and cozy, but the tables are far enough apart that you don't have to worry about being too romantic with the people at the table over.  service is good.

Vi dug it.  5$ mojito happy hour special in the 2red lounge half was amazing, like, really good mojito with lots of alcohol.  i had the port-gorgonzola fondue and it was very tasty.  it came with bread and meat, and i kind of wish it had been cheaper and only come with bread, because i liked the bread + fondue better than the meat + fondue.  \u000a\u000ait was comfy and quiet in there and our waitress was nice and changed the channel on one of the tvs from espn to the news for me.  there was hardly anyone there (reasonable at 4p on thursday) which is actually probably part of why i liked it so much-- it was quiet.

Vi think it is clear that there is better mediterranean food in champaign (pasha) and probably also better diners (merry ann's) but my experience at pickles / papa george tonight was awesome.  there are so few times in life when an anticipated experience can live up to its imaginings, but when i sat down in that still-decorated-like-pickles restaurant and pulled out both the old pickles menu and the new, printed on paper, completely stylistically different greek menu, and our waitress came over wearing tan jeans and a tie-dye pickles tshirt and accepted our order for both a heineken in a frosty mug and a hummus appetizer, i almost lost it from the surreality of the situation.  \u000a\u000ait was unique, in an awesome, awesome way, for example, when the manager went over to the register at the bar, printed out a mysteriously long length of receipt tape, handed it to one of the waitresses, and told her that that was the wine list with prices.  or that the specials whiteboard up front (a remnant of the pickles days) proclaimed that the side of the day was macaroni salad, but that the dessert of the day was baklava.\u000a\u000ai kind of hope they keep it that way.  \u000a\u000amy pork souvlaki was actually very good.  the bread, vegetables, and rice that came with it were less than fresh but i really can't take any points away from them for low freshness when they are trying to pull off two full completely non-overlapping menus.  we ordered a hummus and pita appetizer, and they kept refilling our pita until all the hummus was gone, which was awesome.\u000a\u000awe also sampled from the pickles menu; my friend ordered the hawaiian chicken sandwich and claims that it was "actually really good."  again, awesome.

V1. is it me or do the portions keep getting smaller as the prices get higher?\u000a\u000a2. there is plenty of seating but its always crowded.\u000a\u000a3. the food is okay but if i had to choose a place in oakland to get soup, salad, or a sandwich it would be red oak cafe.

Vit's hard to be in this place without comparing it to panera, and i think it comes up short.  the dishes i had did consist of fresh ingredients, but i think they were more healthfully prepared which made them not quite that super sodium-y fatty panera tasty.  \u000a\u000ait was really clean in there, but i kind of got the feeling that was only because it was brand new and that in 6 months it would be grimy.  the staff were really friendly, but it was a very forced friendliness.\u000a\u000athe free wifi is cool.  if it were closer to campus, i would probably think it was a great place to have a working lunch or a sticky bun while doing more work after work.

Vthe only reason i go here is because it's so very very close to my house & they have superfast wireless. the staff is sometimes super helpful and , well, sometimes not very helpful. the walls are bright and cheery, the owners seem to be very committed to the community and providing a space for events that probably have a hard time in other venues - weekly belly dancing, weekly political movie nights, speed dating for single vegetarians, etc. the seating is a lot of low tables and pillows, and yes, there are often a lot of hippies here. the space is bright and open, and provides a "community" space - i have seen spirited discussions start up among strangers across the room. \u000a\u000ayiv is open late like a bar, but there's no smoking or alcohol, which is a positive thing, honestly. some of their special brewed iced teas are heavenly - a lot of other menu items are a little "eh." they can make turkish coffee, but they have no espresso machine. a lot of the beverages are not good when you order them with soy milk, so be careful, my vegans. the food is highly variable, but usually at least edible, and there are vegan options. \u000a\u000ait's good for all ages - ive seen lots of happy little kids here. and the older set too - byob with a small corking fee. the flavored sodas are pretty fucking delicious - i recommend lavendar vanilla. \u000a\u000ai definitely get the impression that this is a group of people who are pretty new to running a business, but they are working to make it happen, and i think that's a lot of what butler street needs.

Vthis bike shop is a cool little place.  it's conveniently located in oakland and does sales, repairs, as well as plans some events for the cycling community here in pittsburgh.  \u000a\u000ai am a mountain biker, so i haven't really gone to any events, but i am sure they're fun!\u000a\u000agot my bike tuned up (she was in such neglected shape, i'm sorry!!!!) there for around $45.  it was worth it, they did it quickly and well and didn't come up with any bogus things that needed to be fixed (unlike some other shops i've been to).  i'll definitely be going back here if needed!\u000a\u000ayou can even enjoy a margarita at mad mex which is a block or so away while you wait.  :d  just don't bike (too) drunk!

Vwhenever i head to paris 66 for din-din, i always pass vanilla pastry studio.  and it's always closed.  this past weekend i had paris 66 for lunch on saturday and i walked by to see the store was open!  so after lunch i headed back to check it out.\u000a\u000avanilla pastry studio has a giant selection of tasty treats ranging from brownies to their special lolly's to of course cupcakes!  i ended up getting their red velvet cupcake topped with a standard frosting and their chocolate cupcake topped with espresso buttercream.  the red velvet was absolutely delicious; rich and moist and not dried out even though i had the cupcake three hours after i bought it.  the frosting was a tad too sweet for my liking, but overall it was still delicious.  i love all things espresso and i found the chocolate cupcake absolutely amazing.  the flavor of the espresso buttercream was a perfect pairing with the chocolate.  i found the cupcake itself to taste a little off just at the edges, but the espresso-flavor definitely made it all better.\u000a\u000aat $2.25 each, it's definitely on the affordable side when it comes to cupcakes ($25 for a dozen, basically buy 11 get one free).\u000a\u000athey're open until they sell out of tasty treats, so some days they might close earlier than other days.\u000a\u000avanilla pastry studio definitely has the best cupcakes i've had in pittsburgh so far, i'll definitely be back.

Vvanilla pastry is located right near my office, so we always get their cupcakes for somebody's birthday, any other special occasion....or you know, when the cupcake mood strikes.  i've picked some up on the way home for a dessert to share with my boyfriend, and given them as a gift to friends.\u000a\u000athe quality is always excellent.  the cupcakes are the most beautiful things, each looking more delicious than the previous.  the flavors rotate, and i can't recall all the ones i've tried, but i know i enjoyed the lemon cupcakes, and the red velvet in particular.  the frosting is creamy and appealing, and that's a lot coming from me since usually i find frosting to be too sweet and overwhelming.  the decor is adorable too - it really is the cutest, brightest little shop!  i want to say the cupcakes are about $4 each?  but i think it's worth it for the price.  rather than buy a whole bunch, i'd say just get one for you and one for your lover and just eat them fresh.  they taste best the day you buy them.\u000a\u000ait's easy to find metered parking in the area, so stop in the next time you are craving something sweet and beautiful!

Vbig mama's house of soul offers pretty good bbq.  their st. louis cut ribs slathered in a unique sauce were tender with just a small amount of gristle.  i ordered an entire rack and was expecting it to come as two half racks; it came as individual ribs.  they were easily a notch above ribs served at chain restaurants such as tgi fridays or rock bottom.  the potato salad is to die for.  the collard greens were on the salty side, but cooked well.  the yams delicious, but near the end the sweetness got to my mouth.  the portions are pretty sweet.  its name is also pretty sweet.\u000a\u000abe advised: there is currently no indoor seating as it is a takeout / delivery place.  there are picnic benches outside where my companions and i ate, but it was october and quite windy and chilly at the time.

Vlittle's shoes is another one of those places that seems to have been around forever.  i've been coming here since i was a little girl.  i like the full-service attention i get here and i'm willing to pay for it.  i can't shop at the self-service places like famous footwear, payless, or dsw.  shoes from those places never seem to fit right.\u000a\u000apeople might think that little's costs too much.  well, really you can find shoes in all sorts of styles and price ranges.  plus the salesperson actually fits your foot and makes suggestions.  i bought this really cute pair of merrill agaves.  plus i needed some hiking shoes too and they had this pair of merrell chameleon arc stretch hikers that felt really good on my feet.  not that i was following a merrill theme here.  i've also found some cute stuff in the past to go with the vintage wear i occasionally wear.  \u000a\u000amy husband rick likes this place for shoes too.  he says it's better to pay a little extra and get a pair that will be comfortable and last you.

Vlittle's is absolutely the best.  their sales staff are helpful, good humored, and very knowledgeable.  they have an excellent inventory and they carry the brands i like the best.  i have been buying my shoes there for many years, and the store keeps the same high standard of excellent customer service.\u000a\u000ai like knowing little's is not a chain store.  i like their experience and selection.\u000a\u000ai generally buy naots, and little's keeps the price competitive with what i would pay online.

Vthis place is  located in a pretty fun place, south side works.  i  like the interesting shops in the area and a few restaurants.  unfortunately, many of the restaurants are national chains like this one.  however, this place knows what it is doing.  you won't be blown away, but i've never had a bad meal here.  i went today with a couple friends and sat at the bar.  the space is nice enough with plenty of seating and high ceilings.  the bar area is pretty nice with a few hightops scattered about.  on the weekends this place can get pretty busy at the bar.  today we were the only ones there.  the bartender jen used to  work here and then she was at the library down the street and now she's back again.  she's competent and friendly enough.  she said she makes a terrific bloody mary, so we ordered a few.  the bloody mary was very spicy and very strong.  it was a  good bloody mary and certainly wouldn't take more than two of these to wake you up in the am.  we started out with a nice very fresh sourdough bread with butter.  the sourdough was great.  i'm thinking "breadworks".  i tried a smoked salmon appetizer that was served with red onions, capers, and chopped eggs.  it was very much a brunch dish.  the salmon was tasty and their were plenty of toppings.  the salmon was served on these crispy crackers with some type of flavorless sauce.  when  you  bite into the crackers the whole thing basically explodes.  it's not a very user friendly way to serve the salmon.  this would have been much better with just a bagel and some cream cheese.  i tried a friends "firecracker" rolls.  it was basically a chicken egg roll.  it was okay, but not memorable.  he also ordered a reuben which he said was good.  i tried one of his fries that looked good, but was kind of mushy instead of crispy.  i had a tilapia which was served encrusted with some type of nut (pecans maybe, don't quite  recall).  it was cooked perfectly and quite frankly a little too big for a lunch portion.  served with a nice tasty rice pilaf and some green beens.  this was good, but heavier than i would have liked with the topping on the fish.  overall this place does fish quite well.  the dinners are a bit overpriced, but again it is a franchise.  this is a perfectly suitable option in the south side works.

Vpros: \u000a- no wait for a table at 7:00 on a friday\u000a- waitress was friendly\u000a- prices were good\u000a- the pumpkin curry was delicious and the portion was big enough to have plenty leftover for lunch today.  i ordered a spice level of 6-7 and thought it was spot-on.  (my friend asked for zero spice and thought hers was too spicy.)\u000a- the presentation of the spring rolls tied up with a bow was adorable.\u000a\u000acons:\u000a- no hostess table, so we kind of hovered awkwardly until someone noticed us\u000a- there were a number of bugs on the walls.  i'll chalk it up to the cool evening and i'm not blaming the restaurant but it was a little off-putting.\u000a\u000aoverall pretty good, and close to my apartment so i will probably be back.  there are a number of dishes on the menu that look good (i'm really curious about the banana blossom dish in particular).  other than the bug thing, which may not have been their fault, it was a pretty good dinner.

Veh. i was so excited to try this restaurant that i gathered 5 other co-workers (including 1.5 filipinos - one person is half) for dinner one tuesday evening. unfortunately, i was hyped up for no reason. one caveat - i went to sweet basil to try their filipino menu, so i did not try anything on their thai menu. \u000a\u000ame and 3 other people ordered the taste of la filipiniana entree, which includes a soup, rice, chicken adobo, beef caldereta, shrimp curry, and a dessert for $14.95. not a bad deal... if it tasted good. the main complaint across the table was that the sauces were way too peppery, which the cuisine experts at the table said is completely unlike authentic filipino food that favors blander flavors. boo #1. for me, the meat - both the chicken and the beef - were waaaaay too overcooked like they were sitting in a crock pot for a week before making its way on to my plate. boo #2. the last thing is always something i look for when i want to give a restaurant some props for service - my water was not refilled regularly. boo #3. that's enough boos to take off 3 stars on my yelp review.\u000a\u000athe only things i did taste and enjoy were - the asian pumpkin shrimp curry on the monthly special menu, my sticky rice with thai custard dessert, and the cassava cake dessert. but, it wasn't enough to make me go back for more...

Vthe food is delicious but the atmosphere is strange. jb and i went for a late dinner, there was one other table seated, no music playing in the background, both tables were whispering as not to intrude on the others conversation, so yeah - it was awkward.\u000a\u000anext time, we order take out.

Vi had lunch here last week mainly because of its convenient location.  tom and i are considering leasing some office space in the building and thought we needed to gather all the information neccessary to make an informed decision (local bar and restaurant obviously having a solid influence).  i wasn't too excited to have lunch here i had wanted to try it years ago when kevin sousa gained local and some national attention for his alchemy menu, however that was several restaurants ago for kevin and i believe he is now at nine on nine.  anyways, we got there at about 1145 i think on thursday.  the waitress came over and took our drink orders and then left us alone for a little too long... about 20 minutes however she probably thought we were busy since there was blueprints everywhere.  she finally came over and was friendly enough and took our order.   the space itself is minimalist with earth tone colors and a well stocked bar in the back.  it has hardwood floors plenty of sunlight and in general is a very adequate space and it's good there is a seperate entrance on the side to get to the restaurant without having to walk through the hotel lobby.  we started with some cold bread and cold oil of some type, kind of meh'.  again, i wasn't expecting too much from this hotel restaurant.  i started with a cup of there soup of the day which was a spicy black bean soup, that was surprisingly... well... delicious i'd say.  my only complaint is that it wasn't that spicy and was served only slightly warm, not pipin' hot how most soup should be.  i ordered the blt that came with pierogies as an option for a side instead of just regular fries or a veggie.  the pierogies were really good served perfectly sauteed with good potato and cheese filling and perfectly caramalized onions and sour cream.  i was really happy with this side, not just because it was an option as a side, but because it was executed perfectly.  my blt was also really good.  it wasn't just normal or crispy bacon it was thick braised pork/bacon with a reallly delicious flavor served on really good quality sour dough bread with a nice slaw of some type instead of just lettuce.  the price was also good at $10 for the sandwich and sides.  it was a healthy portion. speaking of prices i thought my cup of soup was a bit overpriced in comparison at $6 for the cup.  tom had the "cheese steak", which wasn't steak at all but braised short ribs served wtih good quality amish chedder.  the fact that these folks put such care into the lunch menu makes me want to go back for dinner.  i was pretty impressed and pleasantly surprised by this lunch spot and may be another check in the plus column in influencing to add space in this area.  i probably should give this place four stars, but i've been told recently that i'm too generous with the stars so maybe i'm a bit self conscious.  in either case i'll be back.

Vi'm gonna go along with what ryan has to say about this place.  i'm also wary of hotel restaurants because they vary so greatly in quality and they tend to be a little pricey.  besides, a hotel bar-and-grill is one of the least likely places you'd expect a sister-and-brother to dine at.  \u000a\u000amy brother paul and i ended up eating dinner here last night before going over to the civic* arena for the roger daltry/eric clapton concert.  our original plan had been to meet at chinatown inn.  indeed, i had my heart and palate set on good chinese food.  but with the winter weather we decided to eat at a place a little closer to the arena.\u000a\u000athe food here wasn't bad, but holy macaroni!  $12.00 for my cheeseburger?  $15.00 for my brother's steak sandwich?  good thing we ordered off the bar menu, 'cos we weren't planning on spending $35.00 per person for dinner.  we're not cheap or anything, but niether one of us budgeted close to $90.00 for the two of us after tax and tip!  \u000a\u000abut it's alright in a pinch and i guess they cater to travel-weary hotel guests.\u000a\u000a*yes i still call it the civic arena.

Vthis is serious coffee by serious coffee nerds for serious coffee nerds. they serve intelligentsia beans, which aren't my favorite, but the baristas' skillz make up for the shortcomings of the beans. i heard they train their staff for 6 months before they serve a shot to a customer, but i don't know if that is even possible. \u000a\u000athey have a clover machine - i feel like this is a reasonable standard for coffee nerds. if the owners are willing to drop $10k on a machine to make a cup of coffee, they probably pull a decent shot. there are lots of fancy coffee and tea implements for sale - the inventory on display in the store gives it a little bit of a "chemistry lab" feel. \u000a\u000athere is a small assortment of tasty pastries and sandwiches, outdoor seating in the great people-watching region of the strip district, and a really cozy and lovely upstairs. i am probably at 21st street at least once a week, and their soy cortado has saved my life more times than im willing to admit.

Vit's all about the clover coffee. seriously. try it.\u000a\u000athis is one of my favorite coffee shops in the pittsburgh area, partly for the clover coffee, and partly for pleasant upstairs seating with a view. give it a try, it won't disappoint.

Vi used to consistently rate this as my favorite pittsburgh coffee shop, but with recent experiences, i no longer feel that way. there's no doubt about it - the coffee is excellent here, but there's more to a coffee shop than the taste of the coffee. the employees are definitely pretentious about their coffee, and if you aren't a coffee snob, you may get snubbed. i recently brought some friends here for a cup, and when they asked for cream and sugar, they were told that they should try the coffee black first, and then, if absolutely necessary, cream and sugar could be found. while i actually agree with the baristas - the black coffee is divine here - it seems a little on the rude side to say something like this to your customers (who were slightly offended). it also kind of blew my mind that they had trouble coming up with napkins when asked. really? is that an uncommon request?\u000a\u000aregardless, 21st street does a mean pour over coffee. they have excellent chai tea lattes and a nice upstairs seating area with a view of the street. if you consider yourself a coffee snob, you'll love this place. if you just want a cup of joe, go somewhere else.

Vi love the bagels here.  i daresay that i like these bagels better than the ones at nearby bruegger's bagels.  they appear to be made on-site here.  bruegger's pre-makes them and finishes them at their locations.\u000a\u000ai will agree that the tuna-melt is wonderful here.  i think that it is my favorite thing on the menu.  i'll even go for an old favorite,lox and an onion bagel.  other bagel varieties here include poppy seed, cinnamon raisin,  cracked wheat, honey oat, rye onion, and of course, plain.  please note that these bagels are very high in carbs and since i am a type-1 diabetic, i have to be very careful in choosing here (and watching my insulin!).

Vas somewhat of a reply to another review, you walk in and get in line.  when you get to the counter, you tell them what you want, and they give you a check, which you take to the register.  you get drinks at the register and pay, while the person who took your order makes your food and then brings it out to you.  service is always good.\u000a\u000ai've been in here many times for breakfast, for lunch, and five minutes before they close, and five to ten minutes is pretty typical; longer than that is very atypical, in my experience.  if they have a lot of take-out orders, the place can be very busy without many people sitting down.\u000a\u000athat said, the bagels are outstanding, as is the rest of the food; they serve full breakfast fare and sandwiches; it's a full deli.  the food here is wonderful, and it's a place i take out of town visitors to and would do so again.\u000a\u000athere's also a ben & jerry's ice cream in the same space; they hire only disadvantages/at-risk kids, and it works out pretty darn well.

Vi love the bagel factory!!!  it's a great place to stop by for a quick bite if you're in the neighborhood.  as other reviewers have said, the service is slow, the tables are often dirty--but never quite as dirty as the bathrooms. :/  the coffee is terrible, and i will stop by starbucks for my beverage before stopping here.\u000a\u000ahowever, that being said, their everything bagel sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese is amazing.  it is perfect salty, crispy, chewy deliciousness.  it is the holy grail of breakfast sandwiches.  it is the only thing i have ever ordered here and the only thing i ever will...perfection.  and for that, 4 stars!

Vthis place can be hit or miss.  i like their bagels, and the food i've gotten has always been tasty (except for the corned beef hash).  usually service is friendly, but it is slow, slow, slow.  if you're in a hurry at all, skip bagel factory.  there's also a ben & jerry's inside, but i've never tried it.

Vbagels!!!!  delicious bagels!!\u000a\u000athe bagel factory is one of my favorite nom-related establishments in my neighborhood.  we don't get bagels from there often (we have to walk a whoooole block and a half to get there....we're lazy) but i suspect as summer approaches and warm weather inspires me to walk around the neighborhood, it'll happen.  \u000a\u000atheir bagels are so delightful.  fresh, delicious smelling and tasting, and they know how to properly season an everything bagel.  those bagels should not just be everything, but everywhere.  i would like my poppy seeds, onion, and sesame seeds on the top and the bottom of said bagel.  otherwise one half is amazing and one half is essentially plain.  bagel factory understands this.\u000a\u000aso i went there for breakfast for the first time about a week ago, and ordered matzah brie, for fun.  i make it myself, but i thought i'd try their version.  so i order it, and the dude behind the counter is like "and what kind of bagel would you like?"  and i'm all "does not compute...." and he's like "it comes with a bagel."  \u000a\u000a......\u000a\u000amatzah comes with a bagel?  carbs + carbs = breakfast?  okay!\u000a\u000aso i got an everything bagel with cream cheese, and fried matzah (which had yummy onions in it).  a really weird breakfast, and i was sort of craving like...fruit or something....but all the components were delicious.  oh and i had a chai tea.  also tasty.  hard not to be.\u000a\u000ai'd definitely come back here for more brunches, but i think i'd just get a bagel sandwich of some sort, to avoid the carb+carb confusion.\u000a\u000aalso, do you know how hard it is to walk past that ben and jerry's counter?  even at like, 10 am on a sunday?  in winter?  holy moly.  too much tastiness in one place.  if the bagel factory ever implodes, we will know why.  ice cream and perfect bagels under one roof may be too much for the structural integrity of the building to handle.

Vbagel factory is one of those places i hadn't stopped at in awhile, so after a morning of strolling and shopping in the neighborhood, i thought i'd have a revisit.  truth be told, ruggeri's is actually my favorite place now in squirrel hill for a sandwich.  but since i'm off work all week, i figured i could stop there on another day.\u000a\u000ai was in the mood for a good sandwich though and i thought i'd try "reuben's sister rachel".  a rachel is basically corned beef on deli rye with kraut, swiss, and russian dressing.  my sandwich was a good, nuthin' fancy, basic, solid fare.  \u000a\u000abagel factory is okay in my book and i've got to admit theirs are w-a-y better than bruegger's!  but the carbs, the carbs!

Vthe bagels are on the tough and chewy side, and the orange juice (which for some reason i though would be fresh) tasted like minute maid. if that sounds like your idea of good food, go for it! seriously, this place is okay, but it's nothing special - decent enough food, but nothing amazing.

Vthis is one of those locally-owned places that you s-o-o-o want to succeed!  now that you're done wishing, get out there and patronize it!  the owner, liliana petruy, is a native of argentina and the cafe specializes in coffee and pastries from that country.  she was in danger of having to close a few years ago because the building was slated to be demolished for redevelopment.  can't have too many condos, y'know!  \u000a\u000arick and i split an absolutely mouth watering flan.  oooh was that heavenly!  i'd love to try the caoncito, cones with dulce de leche inside!  i'm also gonna stop in some time for lunch and try the sandwiches and empanadas (hmmm!  i do have this friday off!).  as expected the coffee here is outstanding.  makes me kind of glad i don't drink and coffee is my alcohol!\u000a\u000aone thing though.  i'll bet that tango cafe got a lot of foot traffic from the nearby squirrel hill cinema.  now that the theatre's closed, i wonder how it's affected patronage here.  all the more reason to get out and support this place.

Vmy boyfriend and i took the day off work to enjoy the warm, sunny weather.  on the way back from washing the car, we passed the tango cafe and decided it was high time we got some empanadas.  they run about $2.25 each, i think.  i also got a "fruit ice" which is canned fruit blended with ice.  it took the woman a few minutes to get it all together, but i would much rather wait a few minutes than have her just grab food that's been sitting under a heat lamp!  it's cash only, so keep that in mind.  clearly she was the owner, the only employee in the whole place.  she was quiet but friendly.\u000a\u000amy fruit ice (i got the peach kind) was refreshing as advertised, but simple.  it literally tasted like canned peaches blended with ice, but since that's exactly what fruit ice is made of, i expected and enjoyed it.  they also offer fruit smoothies if you want something that presumably tastes fresher.  we took our snacks home, and dug in.  we got four for two of us which i think is a good snack size.  the empanadas are quite small - maybe 4-5 bites each - if you wanted lunch, you might want 4 for yourself.\u000a\u000awe tried the beef, the sausage, the chicken, and the spinach.  all were quite good - the crust looked and tasted unquestionably homemade.  they were hot and still a little shiny from the fryer.  the beef was my favorite - well seasoned, with a hint of olive flavor.  the chicken tasted very fresh.  the spinach was nice since it added a relatively healthy snack to the mix.  all of them were very good little bites.\u000a\u000aplease come for a snack, and support a  local business.  sounds like the coffee and pastries are really special - we didn't try either this time - so i will no doubt be back for more!

Vwell it's closed now folks!  what a great loss to the community.  tango cafe was more than just a good cup of joe. liliana petruy started the business shortly after she emigrated from argentina.  as the triblive says, "she let local artists display their work on her walls. she scheduled regular live musical performances. she gave spanish lessons and dance instruction, including, of course, the tango."  petruy has since moved back to argentina.  \u000a\u000arick and i stopped in here a couple of times and i for one will miss the terrific flan.  fortunately for us, there are still a few independently run coffee houses and a few locally owned chains.  patronize those, folks.  they help keep our world from becoming a mcwalbucks!

Vi'm a non-drinker so anyone who knows me knows that my weakness is a great cup of coffee.  what bars are to other people, coffeehouses are to me.  i stopped in here recently while on my way to south hills village.  i tried the crooks corner blend which was a nice summertime blend.  really smooth and tasty!\u000a\u000ait's too bad i live in squirrel hill (or maybe not, 'cos we have some great coffee there too) because i'd be here almost every day.  the help is knowledgeable and the atmosphere here is terrific.

Vthis place is twice as big on the inside as it appears from the outside.  in addition to the main showroom, which is organized loosely by type of stuff (beaded handbags, silver, china, military decorations, that kind of category), there are about 10 little rooms off to the side that are set up like as the room of the person whose estate the stuff in the room came from.  there's lots of actual good stuff which actually outnumbers the amount of the usual stupid antique store dusty crap. \u000a\u000ai am going to go back soon and buy a bookshelf i saw.  highly recommended.

Vthis place is divine.  the food is divine.  the atmosphere is divine.  i have nothing bad to say about it.\u000a\u000ai've been for both afternoon high tea and for sunday brunch.  the high tea is one of the best i've tried so far.  i'm not usually a scones person, but their scones have actually changed my mind - i usually associated scones with these dense, dry rocks that you could use to kill someone.  but their scones are fluffy and delicious.  so even if you're not a scones person, and hence avoid high tea, try them here.\u000a\u000athe sunday brunch was equally delicious.  i won't say too much here, mainly because i don't remember the precise details, but suffice to say that it was incredibly enjoyable.  they charge $18 for a pre fixe meal.  bring your parents, bring your friends.  if you're a dude, bring your date - she'll be impressed that you even know that high tea exists.

Vpricey, and you should make a reservation ahead of time to guarantee a table. however, the service was friendly and the food was excellent. when the weather is nice outside, their outdoor patio can't be beat especially since smoking is not allowed (yay!). this is possibly the best outdoor eating experience available in the burgh due to the location away from traffic noise and smoke.

Vbest italian food i've found in town so far.  four folks, four dishes, all perfectly done.  my father got the lasagna, and it wound up being two or three meals worth of food.  my food was original and delicious, my girlfriend's food was awesome, and my mom's choice (spaghetti + meatballs) doesn't take much for a kitchen to get right, but it was spot on.\u000a\u000awill be headed back to check out the sunday brunch buffet soon.  good, inexpensive, tasty food.

Vi have a few things to report on this place.  since this place appeared on restaurant impossible it is good to report that the decor and menu are still just about the same when on the show.  sadly, the management and higher ups haven't really changed, same mentality.\u000a\u000awhat drew us in here was a sign on the side of the street: "all you can eat pasta bar." great we thought, let's go in and try it out.  then everything seems to have gone down the toilet.  when we got inside and attempted to order the pasta bar we were told it wasn't available due to the street festival going on outside.  hmm, funny, because there is still a sign, if not two, posted outside advertising this.  if you were not going to honor this special (which i believe runs wednesday, thursday, and friday) then maybe you should have taken in the signs for that week.\u000a\u000awhen we decided we weren't going to dine here and let our waitress know our intentions we got this great, drawn out excuse why we shouldn't go.  instead of honoring the all you can eat portion of this, they would hand you a card with options on it to fill in for the pasta bar.  mind you, it wasn't even all you can eat, just whatever you checked on the card (more like a slip of paper) was what you got.  \u000a\u000aafter sitting there and made to feel guilty our waitress came back over and gave us the real reason for the guilt trip: her manager (who just happened to be the hostess as well) would eventually yell at her that night and quite possibly fire her.  i felt bad, especially since she was about to cry, but don't guilt trip me into buying food at an establishment that was priced higher than should be and obviously didn't honor their specials.  (to our waitress, i am very sorry we didn't stay, even your tears couldn't get us to stay.  i hope you still have your job.  if the management fired you for us walking out, that is just bad practice, patrons walk out of establishments for far less than what we walked out for (this shows that the attitudes haven't changed from the show)).\u000a\u000awill i ever go back here willingly, probably not.  i'd return if whomever i was with begged and pleaded to come here.  that would be the only way.

Vi ordered delivery from here on a rainy weekday night when it was just too hot to cook or even think about eating hot food.  i was craving sushi and sakura had a lower minimum order price than sushi too.  ordering is easy through campus food.  they said delivery would be an hour but it was just about half an hour, which was excellent.  they also kept the vegetables tempura separate from the rolls so the sushi didn't get heated up, which i appreciated.\u000a\u000athe vegetables tempura were fine but i didn't think the choice of vegetables was all that good.  there were sweet potato pieces, some kind of squash, broccoli, and half a bell pepper.  i would have liked a little more variety.  they used julienned cucumber instead of a big chunk, so the rolls tended to fall apart.  the avocado rolls were ok.\u000a\u000aeven though it's cheaper than sushi too, i'd rather pay a bit extra.  the quality shows.

Vi'd been here a couple of times with a friend of mine who lives in mount lebanon.  i can only rate the coffee here 'cos i've never had their food or baked goods. \u000a\u000agood coffee here, but the help here seems a little eclectic.

Vreally nice chill spot. this is a place you go to get your night started before moving on to tryst or xs. the dj is off the hook! be for warned, depending on the night you go there can be a lot of old people there! 60 years old +! i got free passes at the ferrari store so that was a plus! \u000a\u000athe drinks are high but stiff! just play at the slots for a few minutes and get all the free drinks you want! they are the exact same as in the club. \u000a\u000athe lanerns on the ceiling and the outdoor space is really nice too!

Vthe service at this location is always excellent.  the staff is practically falling all over themselves to be helpful.  if i wait for something more than a minute, i get profuse apologies.  we used their safety deposit box service which worked very well for us, and was always very easy to access.  atms are well-maintained.

Vkelly's is: adorable, formerly uber-hipster, currently populated largely by grad students, delightful, dark, red, art deco bar with beautiful booths and an amazing secret patio, where i actually had one of the most painful break-up conversations of my life - fortunately i was doing the breaking, so it didn't spoil the space for me! \u000a\u000athe mac & cheese is one of the best in the city, and the sweet potato fries are pretty good. in fact, there are a number of tasty food items on the brief menu, but the mac & cheese is the super star. \u000a\u000athe drink menu is delightful, and the bartenders here can whip up stylish trendy drinks as easily as the beautiful endangered classics. lupec (ladies united for the preservation of endangered cocktails) makes kelly's the centerpiece of some wonderful women's history action, and for this alone, kelly's bartenders should be commended. lupec has tabletop information about women's history and classic cocktails year-round. be prepared to drop $$ for your mojito, but rest assured it is probably the best you could buy in pgh. trust me, i tried them all. the prices are a little high, with my expectations based on the crowd they draw. \u000a\u000athe wait staff here is notorious. if you are friends with someone working there, you will probably get amazing service, and call those who complain liars and wimps. if you don't know someone, be prepared to exercise your patience. i'm not saying it's not worth it, but it can be extraordinarily trying. \u000a\u000athe jukebox is another highlight - patsy cline alongside the pixies? be still my heart. some of pittsburgh's more talented djs spin themed evenings regularly at kelly's, but there's not room for dancing and you'll get filthy looks if you try. \u000a\u000abasically, this used to be like the brillobox, before the b-box existed. now it's a little less insane, but still often packs them in. you may wait a long, long time for a table. if you get food service on a friday night, god is probably smiling directly at you with freshly-bleached teeth and a cosmic sunbeam.

Vas far as bars go, this is one of the better ones in pittsburgh. non-smoking, decent beer selection, and decent bar food in a convenient location. only complaint really is that it gets extremely noisy inside which makes it hard to hold a conversation.

Vi cannot say enough about kelly's. from the delicious mac-n-cheese (the best i've ever had) to the great beer selection to the daily "vintage" cocktail specials to the fantastic, multi-genre jukebox, i love everything about this bar.\u000a\u000athe crowd varies from hipsters to students to older professionals to locals. you can sit in one of the booths inside for hours, play cards and talk, or you can sit outside on their patio during nice weather.\u000a\u000abeer prices are reasonable, and well worth the cost.

Vsooo glad we finally decided to try kelly's food! after studying the menu for quite some time, i finally decided upon the tofu tacos and jb got the shrimp po' boy sandwich in addition to our entrees, we wanted to sample some small bites as well. we ordered the famous mac 'n cheese and hot pittsburgh tofu bites. \u000a\u000atofu tacos were delightful little cubes of tofu tossed in taco sauce and served on a hard shell with a bed of lettuce and salsa, sour cream and guac on the side. good stuff, though not the highlight. \u000a\u000ashrimp po' boy was "okay" according to jb. the bun was superfluous as he took the top part off and ate it open-face, there was no sauce at all on the sammie, so jb had to douse on the frank's red hot. to put it in his words, "the sandwich was good, but i wouldn't order it again" \u000a\u000athe sides and appetizers are what really shine at kelly's. the french fries that accompanied the po boy were amongst the best i'd ever eaten - deep fried to golden delicious crispy perfection. the hot tofu bites were sooooo good! maybe a little too spicy (my nose was running) but the tofu's consistency was spot on, we both enjoyed immensely! last but certainly not least, we had the mac 'n cheese which definitely lives up to the hype. the crispy charred cheese on top and the smooth, gooey, creamy cheese in the center compliment each other incredibly.. \u000a\u000aservice was great, nice beer selection (i got the breakfast stout - and it was amazingly smooth and clean), even the music was stellar. can't wait to go back!

Vi first heard about kelly's mac and cheese so i had to try it, of course. i'm a huge black pepper fan, and the flavor is extremely prominent in this one so it really hit the spot. it comes out burning hot in a cast iron skillet, and for $6 you get a pretty good amount. i've also had their sweet potato fries and their tacos, both were pretty good. the tacos come with a large helping of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa - the sweet potato fries were more like thick chips. my only complaint was the sweet potato fries, while tasty, didn't seem fried very well - soggy and greasy.\u000a\u000aevery night of the week they rotate through a list of $4 retro cocktails for the whole night. i had a presbyterian one night, and a rob roy another.  i also grabbed a white witch off the menu - very tasty, a lot of rum with a sweet aftertaste.\u000a\u000aoverall an awesome place. happy hour is 5-7pm, btw.

Vslow service when they weren't even half full, burned mac and cheese served without blinking an eye, and pretty much mediocre food all around.  if you're headed here, sit at the bar, and chat with the bartender, and service is a hell of a lot better.

Vwas only here for the bar experience, so this obviously will not encompass the whole vibe of the place.\u000a\u000agreat mix of an old time feel in here mixed with a dash of hipster.  speaking of hipster, i must have been present during hipster night.  the irony here was that the was i was dressed (coming straight from work) i kind of fit in.  \u000a\u000amy black rimmed glasses did not tell me any lies in here when i was going over the draft menu.  so many different ones to select from that i wasn't sure which i wanted more.  of course i tried the brooklyn chocolate and then followed that with an east end winter.  both delicious, both worth the wait/price.\u000a\u000astaff here seem to miscommunicate with one another.  when we first entered we seated ourselves at a booth and the waitress came over to let us know that due to her not feeling well she was going home and that if we wanted anything we would have to go to the bar.  fine by us, no harm there.  went up and ordered the first round and the bartender told us due to the tap taking a while she would bring it to our table, great.  while we were waiting the ailing waitress came back by to tell us that the bartender was not going to bring us our drinks.  at that point i wanted to ask how she was feeling as she had not left, but opted to ignore her.  our drinks were delivered and we were fine.\u000a\u000athe music on this particular night was a mix from the 60s which was fine by me, old tunes are good tunes.  even for as small of a space the dj was crammed into, people were still in front of him dancing it up.\u000a\u000amaybe in the near future i will come back here and try their food selections, i'm hearing some good things about this place food wise, but if i do, that will be an updated review.

Vi absolutely love schenley park, any time of the year.  really, there is so much to see and do in this park because of its large size.  for starters, there's always the conservatory should the winter blues have you wishing for some summer greenery.  second of all, the carnegie museum is right around the corner.\u000a\u000ain the mood for something in the summer?  you'll enjoy the free movies on flagstaff hill.  my husband and i love to bring a picnic dinner and stake out ourselves a nice spot long before the movie starts.  plus there's ample walking and biking available.

Vi call this... a pittsburgh child of hippie hill and dolores park minus the bums, pot, short shorts, the drum circle and open containers. but this is the busiest, coolest public park spot you'll find to lounge around in the grass, read a book, or catch one of the free movies on sunday or wednesday. and unlike the schenley oval, the other sun-bathers here are young and someone you might actually enjoy talking to. \u000a\u000aif you get hungry, pop into one of cmu's eateries. there is a great coffee stand in wean hall on main floor - amazing, frothy lattes!

Vthis is another review i've got to update.  flagstaff hill is still one of the best summer spots in pittsburgh.  my husband and i recently headed over here for the cinema in the park series.  who cares if not every movie they show here is a cinema classic?  it's walking distance from our house.  it's a great place to bring your lawnchairs and a picnic basket and enjoy a dinner under the stars while watching a movie.

Vmy cousin told me that it's too bad i missed last week's free movie.  the patti spadaro band, one of my local favorites, was playing before th film.  oh well.  \u000a\u000ai met up with a bunch of my girlfriends and had a picnic dinner on the hill before last night's movie.  my only nitpick is that they seem to emphasize recent hits.  i wish they'd do a classic film series too.  on the other hand, how better to while away a summer's evening than watching a film under the stars?

Vi ask you, is there any better way to spend a hot summer night than enjoying a movie and a picnic dinner under the stars at flagstaff hill?\u000a\u000amy girlfriends and i met up at my house in squirrel hill, then schlepped our blankets, picnic baskets, and soft coolers down to schenley.    we laid out our spread of homemade chicken, appetizers, veggies, cheese-n-crackers, etc & had a great al fresco meal while enjoying a fine cinematic feature.\u000a\u000ai know i've said nothing new in this review, but movies in the park are just one of the things that make summer in the city great.

Vyeah, it's kind of touristy, but i'll admit that i love station square.  there is always something going on here.  my husband the train fan loves to sit along the csxt railway tracks and watch the frieght trains go by.  some of my favorite stores include hometown sports, where you can get that sports fan anything pittsburgh-related.  morini features italian-themed wear, although they used to have automotive wear too.  pennsylvania wine cellars is a good place to find local wines for the wine-enthusiast in your life.  and sw randall's is a classic toy shop.\u000a\u000athey have since built-up bessemer court with all of the famous chain restaurants, but if you can eat there in your hometown, why eat them when you're visiting?  i love sesame inn for its wonderful chinese cuisine and the melting pot is famous for its cheese fondues.\u000a\u000aoh, and my husband loves the clothes at heinz healy's.

Vi'm downrating station square a little bit here.  it's always been a bit touristy but it's gotten more so over the years.  sure there were some chains in there .  i remember the old roy rogers and houlihan's has been a fixture here for many years.\u000a\u000ai remember when bessemer court was wide open and a pleasant place to spend an afternoon.  now it's all overbuilt with franchised places like buca di beppo, bar louie, hard rock cafe, joe's crab shack, etc.  you know, except for buca di beppo, i've never eaten at any of these!  honestly, what's here that you can't get anyplace else?  i remember these antique railcars they had there that were converted into stores.  one sold jewelry, another sold glassware.  oh but the one i remember the most sold pittsburgh themed antiques.  i mean the place was a real museum of kitsch!  seriously, if you were looking for iron city beer commemorative steeler's cans from the 70s, they had them.  if you wanted duquesne incline salt shakers, they had them.\u000a\u000amy husband rick also remembers the old days as well.  he remembers a hotdog place in the freight house shops that not only had great dogs, but also a ton of microbrews from all over pennsylvania.  he remembers heinz healy's and a store that sold sportswear with the jeep, saab, porsche, etc logos.  he also remembers sitting on the platform outside bessemer court, watching and photographing the freight trains rolling past.  \u000a\u000abut they still have the grand concourse restaurant and gandy dancer saloon, sesame inn, kiku, and a few other local places, so i'll still give 'em four stars.

Vi really like this place.  it reminds me of some of the trendier spots i visit when i'm in boston or new york.  michele who owns the place is a transplant from nyc (i think).  he and his brother are from sicily and really make good authentic italian food.  the kind that has flavor and doesn't require a nap afterwards.  i go here about 3 or 4 times a month and it's perfect to eat at the bar.  liz is the bartender and she's awesome.  she'll make you  feel right at home.  the place is really small, so you will be bumping into some people if it's a friday night.  i suggest trying whatever the special is.  they also have a nice beef carpaccio.  stay away from the small dishes they advertise on the bar, stick to the menu.  only negative is the parking and i'm being a bit picky here, but the music is kind of that euro..too cool for school stuff that sounds like it should be elevator music in some cheesy hotel in russia.

Vi really have no new information to report, because much of what i've said in february remains the same today, except it's better now because the restaurant is non-smoking.  the main reason for this update is to try and refute some of the hateration from lauren b. from phily on liz.  i don't recall reading a review that was so malicious towards one individual in a restaurant.  i've had liz as a bartender for a long time now and used to go to dish a couple times a month.  michele and andres are great (owners and chef) and the rest of the staff is superb, especially liz.  i don't really understand the venom of lauren b..  i mean she never really gives much in the way of specifics of why she hates liz.  i've seen liz wait on hundreds of folks through the years of all different types and she has always treated them with respect if not outright wit and charm.  it's not just the regulars like me.  sure, the place gets busy and often it can take a few minutes to get a drink.  but, what worthwhile place doesn't occassionally get busy.  anyways, just needed to voice a different viewpoint.  lauren, i  can't imagine that liz did something to justify such a mean spirited review.  in fact, i'm pretty sure this review is much more  a reflection of you than her or the restaurant.  good luck with that.

Vthis is a good steakhouse.  it's mostly what you would expect if you've been to this type of place in other cities.  i do like that they tailor the art to reflect the local history.  the bartenders are excellent.  i especially like seth.  unlike mortons and ruth chris the bar is a lot of fun.  the crowd is similiar to the other steak places, but seem to me to be a bit younger.  the steaks are what you'd expect and they are excellent.  however, and this may just be my personal opinion i'd stay away from some of the exotic preparations (like coffee beans) and just stick with a good piece of meat.  i really liked the spinach.  they put just the right amount of nutmeg to give it an interesting taste.  the other sides are about average.  if i had to rank these steak places i mentioned in this review i'd have to say the capital grille is the current favorite.  i'd like to find a local place that is on par with these franchises, since i'd much prefer to support local business owners.

Vthe capital grille is a steakhouse with superb service, a great wine list and excellent food.  i've eaten there about 3 times and have experienced wonderful food and extraordinary service.  the decor is very gentleman's club and over the top masculine.  i particularly like the lobster mac 'n' cheese, which is gourmet comfort food.  their wine list is heavy on the reds, and their strength is american wines.  i believe they have an extensive collection of over 2,000 bottles.  \u000a\u000abut honestly, people go here to impress a business client, or for a special occasion.  it's a great place to go if you are not picking up the tab and you want to feel pampered.  the menu is more diverse than both ruth chris and mortons, when it comes to the food, i think the capital grille far outshines the competition. \u000a\u000athe sommelier is well trained and knows a lot about food pairings and making wine recommendations.   \u000a\u000aso overall, the capital grille is expensive, but at the same time high quality, and is always my first choice when recommending a steak house.

Vsuch a great date night!\u000a\u000aonce we arrived our jackets were taken and we were quickly taken to our reserved booth. (thanks to the free open table android app) \u000a\u000aour server melissa s was great! we told her that we were celebrating a late valentine's day and she brought us each a complimentary champagne toast. we both had the adults only arnold palmer as our cocktails. the bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out. \u000a\u000awe shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. the applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. i just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing. \u000a\u000athe wife had the dry aged steak au poivre (tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and i had the dry aged porterhouse with a side lobster mac & cheese. they were both superb! my porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. the mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of lobster as well. we both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. the creamed spinach is blended with a bchamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  for dessert we had the chocolate hazelnut cake. so good.\u000a\u000athe place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. even the valet guys are nice. i'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak. i couldn't have asked for a better evening!

Vthe food i've had here has been pretty good -- mostly i've had their salads which seem fresh and tasty. the prices are a bit high for a lunch spot, but it's not a bad option once in a while. this appears to be one of the healthier places on craig street.

Vi thought it was a little expensive for a salad in a box that i ordered from a counter and ate outside because it was so packed inside.  it was a good salad though.  i think i will try some other places on my find out where to eat lunch tour before i go back here.

Vtrue to its name, the food here is indeed pretty unique. definitely a nice place and convenient place to have so close to campus. they have an awesome selection of vegetarian options. i usually get the summer sandwich along with a soup or a bag of chips. i accidentally ordered something non-vegetarian once, and the lady at the counter was nice enough to replace that with something vegetarian for me free of charge. a pretty regular lunch/dinner spot while i am still in cmu.

Voakland is full of lunch places, but if you are looking for something light, healthy, and fresh, you're pretty much out of luck....except for eat unique!  i had lunch here earlier today, and was so excited to see a menu of sandwiches and salads that didn't contain french fries....\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is minimalist.  there are some bright colors, but it's mostly just cafeteria-style tables and chairs, no decoration.  you order at the counter, then wait awhile - about 15 minutes in our case - for your lunch.  my boyfriend got the meatloaf melt, and i ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich.  it was hard to wait so long, but as soon as we got our sandwiches it was obvious why we had been left hanging - the food was fresh.  my sandwich was hot, the chicken fresh off the grill, the tomatoes sweet and flavorful, the pesto made in-house (you can see the rustic bits of pine nuts and basil, definitely not the jarred stuff), the ciabatta roll lightly toasted and crispy.  i was really impressed from the first bite.  there's nothing really unique about the sandwich, except that it is made with high-quality ingredients and hasn't been sitting in a case all day, but that made a huge difference!  i tried my boyfriend's meatloaf sandwich, which wasn't as big as i thought it would be, and i liked it okay...the sauce was pretty sweet.  i preferred mine - it tasted so garden fresh.\u000a\u000afor dessert we had a black bean brownie - yes, really - and it was great!  who knew?  it just tastes like a creamy, chocolatey brownie.  you can put black beans in dessert!?  this changes everything.  definitely craveworthy.\u000a\u000athe only thing i'm not crazy about is the ambiance.  since you have to wait so long, it'd be nice if the dining area was more comfortable or better maintained.  there was lots of water on the floor and i almost slipped a few times, we had to wipe down our own table....not a huge deal, but we noticed.  there are lots of big, sunny windows, so that's a plus.  i was also disappointed in the small styrofoam cups for water - i hate drinking out of styrofoam, it feels so wasteful (and the cups are so small you have to go back a million times to refill).  but i'd definitely come back - maybe for takeout next time - if i was very tasty and unlike anything else you can get in the area.

Vfast and cheap.. not a big fan of the food here.. but pretty good value for money.\u000ai really like the curry scallion pancake though.. can't get enough of those.\u000anot the best place for asian food near cmu (that would be lulu's).. but a pretty nice place to come once in a while.\u000aseating is nice.. so good place to catch up with a friend.

Vyou know, i'd seen this place many times 'cos i have a membership at the regent square theatre.  anyway, after a halloween party last night, i wasn't in the mood to cook breakfast, so rick and i headed over here.  it's a nice neighborhood place with an extensive and somewhat eclectic menu.\u000a\u000asome of the more unusual dishes include a mushroom tart and something called a "hopple popple".  heh heh, not for this girl.  after last night, susan wanted her eggs, meat, and cakes so she ordered the square breakfast with scrambled eggs, chicken apple sausage and buttermilk pancakes (pump that insulin, susan, pump!).  hey, after last night, i was hungry and i wanted to chow!\u000a\u000ai'll have to try this place for lunch sometime.

V3.5 stars.  square cafe is the only place to get brunch up in regent square.  there was pretty good sized crowd the last time i went and there was a line around noon so it definitely does get packed.\u000a\u000ai had their chicken and apple sausage omelet, which came with a side of home fries and toast (i chose rye).  my companion ordered their chicken and wild mushroom crepes and a side of fries (out of gluttony).  my omelet was alright; it was pretty standard and i've had better omelets before.  i typically like my home fries to be diced into larger pieces with a bit more of a char; they had a nice sprinkling of tasty seasoned salt though.  also, i would've liked my bread toasted.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, my companion's chicken and wild mushroom crepes were absolutely delicious.  the gooey creamy gruyere cheese sauce brought the entire dish together.  it was topped with some diced tomatoes to add an acidic bite to the dish; i personally found this to be a questionable decision by the chef since the tomatoes contrasted so much from the rest of the dish and didn't really fit in altogether.  her fries were fried crispy and well seasoned; i couldn't stop stealing them from her plate.\u000a\u000aoverall square cafe is a nice brunch spot and i might go back once in a while, but i don't think it would be a permanent fixture in my brunch rotation.

Va good brunch spot in pittsburgh with decent food which isn't too greasy and a full line of espresso drinks. the last time i was here was right before closing time, and i was a bit dismayed that they started mopping the floor with some noxious smelling chemicals before our group had finished eating. kind of ruined the experience, but that's only happened once -- i guess you should come early to avoid that!

Vstopped in for lunch before a day of apartment-hunting in regent square.  i was immediately charmed by the cute atmosphere and friendly staff.  it's a bright room - lots of bold, cheery colors - it doesn't have that dark and aloof feel of many cafes.\u000a\u000athe mugs and drinking glasses were just charming - apparently you can buy them up at the front counter!  we got hot tea, which is always overpriced (1.60 for a tea bag?) but the mugs were so cute, and 1.60 is actually cheap compared to most coffeeshops, so i'm cool with it.  for lunch i had the brie-and-apple grilled sandwich, which had great flavor and was served with hot, crispy, seasoned fries.  the whole menu looks like well-made comfort food.  and they have free wi-fi which we really needed!  i look forward to coming back once we live here this summer!

Va nice alternative to pamela's and without the wait. the space is very clean with typical diner decor, service is great. i liked their coffee a lot, a latte that comes with proper foam is hard to find in a diner. for food, i had a brunch combo thing - sausage (that actually turned out to be a sausage patty but that's alright because i like those better anyway), eggs and potatoes. unlike pamela's, their breakfast combo doesn't come with pancakes, you can choose either eggs or pancakes. sad but it's plenty of food.\u000a\u000athe eggs were great and they have a nice selection of cheeses to scramble them with. potatoes had a nice spicy flavor but were a little dry. i'm definitely adding square to brunch rotation.

Vweeeeeeeeeeeell okay square cafe, i'll give you 5 stars now!  after two consistently tasty meals, and a vibe that makes me feel cheery as soon as i walk in, i think they've earned another star.  yay!\u000a\u000ai was just there on saturday - when i got there around 10:45 or 11, there wasn't a wait for two people (just for larger parties), which was amazing since i pretty much assume i'm going to be waiting in a big line every time i go to brunch anywhere.\u000a\u000ai started with an earl grey latte....and it was amaze.  i love earl grey tea, and this latte was so delicious and so floral, i am so glad i went for it instead of my more standard chai latte.  and they still serve in those lovely mugs!   i really need to buy one of those....\u000a\u000afor foooood, i got the "hopple popple" which sounds very dr. seussian, but is really just a scramble with ham, cheese, and various veggies like spinach and green pepper.  with some buttered rye bread on the side, it was one of the freshest and tastiest breakfasts i've had in a while!  i'm iffy on scrambles at restaurants, since when people screw up scrambled eggs it can be really unpleasant.  square cafe did a perfect job, and it really hit the spot.  loved all that cheeeeese, but the veggies let me pretend i was being healthy.  \u000a\u000aour server was super friendly too.  i wish i had bought more groupons for this place, since i look forward to coming back many times!

Vby far the best breakfast in the 'burgh!  they have lots of southern-inspired breakfast items (hey, the south does have the best breakfast in all america) like cheese grits, biscuits and gravy, and andouille sausage.  their eggs have a nice flavorful yolk, and they're always cooked perfectly.  the coffee is fantastic, and the service is prompt and friendly.  for you veg-heads and health-conscious people out there, square cafe has a variety of delicious omelets and breakfast features like butternut squash hash. their menu changes from time to time, which keeps ordering interesting.  i've also recently forayed into their lunch items with the wild mushroom gnocchi, which can only be described as sublime. \u000a  square cafe is pretty popular, so there can be a wait (5-15 minutes, usually).  just grab a cafe au lait and chill out until your table is ready.  then be prepared to have your culinary world rocked!

Veeeeeee i'm sorry square cafe, but i'm taking a star away.  don't hate me.  i still really like you.  i'm just downgrading from "love" to "really like."  i have tried a few other food items besides the hopple popple, and none of them have been 5 star worthy brunches.  i just came in saturday around 11 (and, delightfully, we barely waited for a table), and the menu was all different.  that was exciting.  i decided to try the green eggs and ham - pesto scrambled eggs with ham.  it was all pretty good - eggs didn't have quite as strong of a pesto taste as i'd like (my boyfriend's mom observed that they tasted more like "basil" and less like "pesto").  but the ham was pretty tasty.  \u000a\u000ai tried my boyfriend's fried chicken and biscuits, and i was super not-impressed.  no.  where to begin.  chicken was boneless, and breaded in a coating similar to what you get when you get fish 'n' chips.  it was sort of like....a chicken finger....in fish breading.  i can't explain it any better.  but it was sort of bizarre in that way.  the gravy had a strange taste to me, a little too sweet perhaps?  and the biscuits were more crumbly, less flaky.  also my boyfriend's mom got the sausage and ricotta frittata, and she said it was pretty good, but didn't have much sausage to go around.  i tried it too - the sausage was tasty, but definitely not plentiful.  \u000a\u000athe last few times i've been in, i've felt this way - like the food isn't quite as good as i remember it.  still, service is great, atmosphere is adorbs, and i still just like being there.  i should also say that the one time i didn't have good service, the manager dealt with it fabulously, and was hugely responsive to me.  it gave me a great vibe about the place and encourages me to keep coming back and trying more brunch items.

Vi don't know if their quality has gone downhill, or if i just hit it on an off day, but i was pretty disappointed today. i ordered the avocado and bacon omelet. when a menu item has the word "avocado" in the name, you expect it to come with a decent avocado, but this one was so unripe that i couldn't even cut it with a fork! if the restaurant doesn't have any ripe avocados, they should just say so when you try to order, and offer alternatives. very unimpressed. also, the home fries which came with the meal were kind of like cardboard, and the toast was soggy. the only good thing about the experience was the pleasant bustling ambiance and the coffee. \u000a\u000ai won't give up on square since i've had decent meals here before, but i think they need to focus on quality control a bit more seriously.

Vthere are choices which are consistently good here, such as the lemon ricotta pancakes. however, some of the other options are a little hit or miss. for example, the last time i got the avocado and bacon omelette, the avocado was so unripe it was not possible to cut with a fork. on my most recent visit, i decided to try the breakfast tacos. while the filling was decent, the corn tortillas had been fried to the point where they were difficult to even bite through.\u000a\u000ai do like that they have an interesting menu, however i'm now a little afraid to experiment with it since my last couple of choices haven't turned out so well. i will probably stick to the pancakes or simple omelette/egg dishes in the future. customer service seems to be good here, so let the management know if you run into problems.

Vi _almost_ like the breakfast burrito here. the way it comes by default is a little sad: three eggs, sauted peppers, onions, mushrooms, and one little tiny scoop of salsa on the side. however, if you modify your order a bit, you can make it much better. order it with two eggs, potatoes (home fries), ham, extra salsa, and ask for some hot sauce. too bad this isn't the default!\u000a\u000athe coffee here is pretty good, and comes with free refills. make sure to tell them you don't want cream if you don't plan to use it, otherwise they'll bring out a huge cup of it and it'll just go to waste.\u000a\u000abig plus: they use nowait, so you can add yourself to the wait list before you even arrive for sunday brunch. if you don't use nowait, plan to wait for thirty to forty five minutes! breakfast on weekdays is much more manageable and you can basically just walk in and sit down. they open early which is a plus!\u000a\u000aps: the pancakes are pretty good here too.

Vi've been wanting to eat at square cafe for the longest time and last week i was able to get one of my friends to come with me to check it out. \u000a\u000awhen we arrived that morning it was busy; most of the tables were filled but there was no long waiting line. my friend and i liked all the bright, colorful paintings that were hanging all around the cafe. so far so good.\u000a\u000amy friend ordered the special of the day, turkey devonshire, and i ordered the omelet ranchero. i was surprised by how quickly the food came out and i wondered, is the food any good? the food was actually better than good- it was amazingly delicious! i can't remember what was in my friend's turkey devonshire but he finished it in several minutes! the portions were more than adequate! i only ate half of my omelet ranchero because i had gotten full. my omelet had cheese and chunks of ham so i had a pretty high protein breakfast.\u000a\u000awe had a great first experience at square cafe and i will definitely return soon with one of siblings.

Vnot a good experience on my first go. the crowd wasn't very good(my friend and i were actually -literally- surrounded by a larger group of college kids who were quite loud and didn't exactly have a very interesting conversation), the service was non-existent and the prices were pretty high, costing about $15 to start and going up from there. the decor was bright and modern, so i can see why some would prefer it to other lounges in the area. i haven't been back, so it might have just been a bad night. also, they don't seem to be big on carding, so under-agers feel free to try your luck.

Vthere's a first time for everything.  and that's just what my visit here was, my first time smoking a hookah.  honestly, my first puff i looked at my friend and said, "who...are...you?"  of course we busted up laughing, and then continued to puff, puff, pass.\u000a\u000ai'm by no means a person who knows my stuff when it comes to hookahs.  i walked in and had no clue what to do, but the staff were helpful in assisting me.  i went with the strawberry banana, bought a drink, went to a table to wait until it was ready for us.\u000a\u000aonce the hookah arrived at the table we were set.  we chatted, listened to the music and just passed the time away in a mellow environment.  every so often the staff would come around and replace the fading coals with fresh ones.  \u000a\u000aone thing i wasn't sure about until we left was whether we were allowed to sit outside or not.  in fact, you are.  there are a few tables on the sidewalk in front of the place so you could people watch while you smoked away.  \u000a\u000aand the only downside to the place is that it is an alcohol free zone.  maybe that's not really a downside, but i think i would have had a better time if i had a libation at hand instead of a water.  for as many people that were in there, the noise level was actually low.  the music was a bit louder than the other customers.  which was odd, but i enjoyed it.

Vas part of my job, sometimes i have to do home visits.  i had to do one today on mount washington, and as it turned out, the monongahela incline was the best way to get there.  the monongahela incline and its counterpart, the duquesne incline, are both a sort of combination cable car/elevator that go up mount washington.  per the port authority's website and brochure, the mon incline is the oldest one in the world, built in 1870.  it was built so residents of coal hill, now called mount washington, could get to the city and their jobs below.  \u000a\u000ahow the mon incline survives today is a matter of forward thinking and location, location, location!  the company that owned it was going to abandon it too, but instead decided to modernize it.  then, in the 1970s and 1980s, two events helped secure its future.  the station square mall and was built out of the old railroad station and facilities located at carson and smithfield streets, right across the street from the incline's lower station.  then, when the light rail system was built, a major station was built a block east of the incline.  plus, it's handy to reach the bars and restaurants up on shiloh street.  \u000a\u000aso not only is the monongahela incline popular with tourists, it is a practical way for people who live up on mount washington to get downtown or to the south hills.  there are overlooks up on the cliff just to the west of the upper station.  on one of our earliest dates, my now-husband and i went strolling up there.  if you have out-of-town guests, or are visiting pittsburgh, there is no better way to see the city, especially at night.

Vhail to the orange, hail to the blue!\u000a\u000ai really think that memorial stadium is beautiful.  since the renovations, it looks especially fantastic.  lots of great memories from this place, and i love coming back to watch the homecoming game.  win or lose, i love going through all the cheers/dance moves that we used to do during college ("to the left!"), although now that we are alums, we don't have as much fun as when we used to sit in the student section.  \u000a\u000ai have to say, last weekend when they played the three-in-one, and the whole stadium rose to their feet and said "chiiiiiiief" i got chills.  this is one place where "homecoming" truly does feel like coming home.

Vas far as bowling alleys go, this is a pretty good one. located on the second floor of an old building, there are two sets of alleys, and a bar with pool tables. the only drawback is the ancient computerized bowling consoles which are kind of difficult to deal with.

Vi have been coming here for several years and i whenever i go, i think to myself, "what a different crowd."  there are all sorts here from the hippie to grunge to yuppie to older professionals.  don't get me wrong, it is still a meat market, but at least there is more variety!  i have to admit it, if i go out to the strip, this is my most likely destination.  fun, not overly crowded, cool vibe (it was a firehouse, now converted and with an outdoor patio area).  the mojitos are usually pretty decent.

Vbest bar/lounge/club i've been to in pittsburgh. small intimate bar area on the first floor, a large bar area/dance floor on the second floor, and a great deck. as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the music is different from any other place in pittsburgh - downtempo, electronica, etc. firehouse lounge has the most "european" feel of any club i've been to in pittsburgh, and that's a good thing.\u000a\u000athe bartenders are quick, drink prices are reasonable (this is pittsburgh, after all), and the atmosphere is amazing. the crowd seems to be a mix of young professionals/students in their 20s-30s and is diverse and international.\u000a\u000ai will definitely be going back.

Vmaybe i like this place because it's the only place i know to go dancing in pittsburgh? maybe i like it because they always play "push it" by salt 'n peppa? maybe i like it because i call it the "fire hose" and giggle? who could answer just timeless questions... alls i know is that i've had fun every single time i've gone here, so i suggest you follow suit.

Voh za's, how i love thee.\u000a\u000ait's changed a bit since i graduated, but it's always been one of my favorite places to get fresh-tasting, delicious food on green street.  seriously, where else would you go?  i've been a fan for years.\u000a\u000ai have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. last time i went, i got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  it felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  the huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the "light" feeling, however...  i also had one of their delicious smoothies, and i have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!\u000a\u000ayeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in champaign.  and oh, the nostalgia factor...

Vgot the 1/4 chicken with rice, beans, and fried plantain. chicken was excellent even though i'm not usually a fan of eating it plain like this; other sides were fine but unremarkable. i was disappointed with the wasteful styrofoam plates and plastic utensils - they should have real ones - but had a good experience otherwise. they also have good looking burritos including a breakfast burrito, so i plan to try one of these next time.

Vperuvian chicken is one of the tastiest ways to eat chicken ever.  it's marinated overnight in a blend of herbs and seasonings and then slow roasted to result in super tender and flavorful meat.\u000a\u000ain pittsburgh there are two places to get peruvian chicken; aj's peruvian in oakland and chicken latino in the strip district.  both places serve up super tasty chicken, but there are slight differences in their marinade which make them slightly different.  i always get a half chicken minimum; i gotta have my dark meat!\u000a\u000athey also have more americanized dishes as well as mexican dishes, but when i go to chicken latino i order chicken.  on weekends they also serve up roast pork and ceviche, which is suppose to be really good as well (i have yet to try them).\u000a\u000ai would recommend not only chicken latino but also all peruvian chicken out there in the world.  check it out.

Vi have eaten here about a dozen times and i have always had a good meal.  the food is delicious and something unique.  i usually get the pollo a la brasa.   they used to automatically give you the spicy verde sauce automatically, but now you need to ask for it.  yum!  i do love the black beans and rice.  prices are very reasonable, and the food is excellent.

Vthe two best things here are the chicken and the hot green sauce! try them in any combination with the various dishes. personally i enjoy the soft chicken burrito, and the breakfast burrito which is definitely the best i've had in pittsburgh. it comes with eggs, cheese, green peppers, and optionally  chicken, which i highly recommend adding. the green sauce is so hot it will make your tongue sweat, but it's awesome. try at least a little. i also enjoy the quesadillas, and if you're feeling adventurous, try the chica morada drink which is made from purple corn.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is super casual, and there are tvs so it may be a little noisy.

Vi'm just a big old kid; you really can't take me anywhere, especially to a place where i get to play with things.  watch out little child, i will push you out of the way to have my turn at that hands on exhibit.\u000a\u000athis time was so much more fun than all other times i attended due to the fact that it was my niece's first time here.  seeing this place through the eyes of a child's first encounter is so much better than your own set of eyes.  it was so hard to tell her no when we were near exhibits that you are not allowed to touch since everything here is so hands on.  she just couldn't help herself, nor could i.\u000a\u000awe saw everything there was to offer.  toured the submarine, walked our way through all the floors, did some exercise at the sports part and just plain enjoyed ourselves to the max.\u000a\u000aon our way out, we stopped at the gift shop and browsed.  but that was not the last thing we did.  we smashed our pennies before we exited and then had the rest of the day to do what we wanted.\u000a\u000a**things to note here, it is pay parking that is on top of your admission (so take fewer cars if you are going in groups).  during football/baseball games and other events, the center closes early to allow parking for said events (you are asked to leave a hour before the events begin).  kids 2 and under are free!

Vthis is a quaint, serene little day spa in the south side. i regularly get my eyebrows waxed here. they use a different kind of wax that doesn't require strips for removal, and it works really well. not only do my brows look great, but the skin isn't all red where the waxing occurred.  \u000afor valentine's day the hubby and i got a couples massage.  he the deep tissue, and i got the hot stone massage.  the whole experience was awesome, relaxing and soothing.  i'd never gotten a hot stone massage before, and i highly recommend it.  their prices are reasonable, and the staff are experienced and friendly.  plus, there's always good candies in the waiting room :)\u000a\u000aoh, just a note: they do not accept american express & bring cash to tip.

Vanna(stasia) skin care is a one woman operation.  she's got a small room tucked away on walnut, and locks the door while she is doing treatments.  i actually find this rather charming, since my old eyebrow queen back in san francisco was exactly this way - you know that you have her complete attention.\u000a\u000athe salon is tasteful and relaxing.  i had my eyebrows waxed ($18) and thought she did a great job - she listened to all of my concerns and gave me directive, but gentle advice, on how we could work together to get my eyebrows back into shape (after a disastrous eyebrow experience elsewhere in pittsburgh).  i would go back to her again in a heartbeat, and can't wait until i have an opportunity to try her facials.  it's taken me almost two years to find a good eyebrow person in pittsburgh, and i'm not letting this one go!\u000a\u000ai'll also say that she has the most soothing voice ever.

Vjust wanted to give yet another shout out to anna for being my go-to person in terms of skincare and beauty for my wedding.  about a week before the big day, i went in for a facial, which was probably one of the best i've ever had.  i was sooo relaxed during the whole experience and just wanted to go home and take a nap afterwards.  my skin also looked and felt great.\u000a\u000aon the day of, anna did my wedding make up and she was phenomenal.  first, she spent so much time with me to figure out what my look would be, and even went with me to sephora (conveniently just across the street!) to pick out products that we would use.  she also did a test run with me on the day i had my facial, and i knew that everything was going to be great.  i looked great on the day of, and what was especially important to me is that anna made sure that i was comfortable and happy with my look.  she didn't do anything too heavy, and made sure that i would look as natural as possible.  i have only seen a few photos so far, but i look fantastic, and a lot of that, i am sure, has to do with my fabulous makeup artist.\u000a\u000athanks anna!

Vi love ulta because it is a sort of "middle ground" when it comes to cosmetics and make-up.  it's a step above cvs but just a hair beneath macy's or nordstrom's.  i had to come here last night because i'm traveling to dallas this week for a training seminar and i needed to be all dolled up for monday's session.  \u000a\u000atheir selections of cosmetics can't be beat and as tricia says, they've got top quality nail polishes, lipsticks, eye shadows, etc.  if you can't find anything you like here, you're way too picky.  they also have a great selection of hair products.  i bought my conair infiniti hair dryer here and it has been wonderful!  \u000a\u000athe location at the waterfront can be a little inconvenient, but since i live in squirrel hill, it's just a hop-skip-and-a-jump away from me.  \u000a\u000ai like their prices and their sales are terrific.  their coupons and rewards programs are fantastic.  not only can i save a lot of $$, but i can get a whole supply of make-up for free.

Vyour one stop beauty shop.\u000a\u000ayou'll find everything from hair care to pedicure products. they also do hair and makeup for those ladies(self included) who missed that day in kindergarten when they taught you how to braid hair and apply eyeliner in a straight line.\u000a\u000athe only negative thing i can say is that every time i find a product i really like, they eventually stop carrying it.

Vthis place is a good theatre to see films that are a little out of the mainstream.  it loses a star for not having the best decor in the world, but don't let that deter you.  i like coming here because the place is well-run and the crowd is above average.  the crowd is there to see a movie, not text-message thier friends!\u000a\u000aoh, and it's practically around the corner from me, so i love it that i can walk here.

Vi had a "girls night out" last night with some friends (ie.  the manor theatre, then coffee at the 61c, then home by 11pm)!  we went here to see "the mysteries of pittsburgh."  the movie was kind of "eh".  while it wasn't bad, it just didn't seem to go anywhere and it was a little flat.\u000a\u000abut i still love the manor theatre for the selections of films it shows.  that, and it's right in the neighborhood.

Vmy husband and i decided to hang out sunday afternoon in the neighborhood.  so we hit eat-n-park, then head over to the manor to catch a matinee.\u000a\u000athere's not much more i can say about this theatre than i already have.  it still can be a bit dingy, but the films they get here are what sets it (and the nearby squirrel hill theatre) apart from the others.  we went to see "the last station", which is about the last year in the life of socialist writer leo tolstoy.  the film was fantastic and not the usual fare which you would find at the local multiplex.  \u000a\u000akudos to the manor and squirrel hill for showing a good mix of films.

Vgreat little theater. only been there a couple times and have always enjoyed myself, mostly because its never crowded.\u000a\u000amy favorite experience is when we went to see inglorious basterds. there were a lot of older jewish couples in the theater and when hitler got his face shot into swiss cheese they all started laughing and cheering. i thought it was cute.

Vwith the closure of the nearby squirrel hill theatre, the manor has become one of the few remaining neighborhood cinemas in pittsburgh and about the only one showing a mix of mainstream movies and indie flicks. the nearby regent square, which i also like, shows art & indie and foreign flicks too, but they don't show mainstream releases. \u000a\u000amy mom and i come here quite a lot. whereas my dad and i bond over music, sports and bad jokes, mom and i enjoy books, museums, & cinema. notice i said "cinema" and not "movies"! now my girlfriends and i like action flix, but that's another story. anyway, mom and i went here last night to see "beginners", a terrific story starring ewan macgregor, melanie laurent, and christopher plummer. directed by mike mills, (no, not he of r.e.m. fame), the story is about how oliver (macgregor) meets the irreverent and unpredictable anna (laurent) only months after his father hal (plummer) has passed away. after 40+ years of marriage, hal had come out as a gay man. \u000a\u000athe manor theatre won't win any architectural awards, especially on the inside.  it's an older theatre cut up into several auditoriums.  still its tudor exterior is charming.  but it's a good place to see a movie, and the atmosphere here is far more relaxed than at the local megaplex.

Vthis is a decent place to see a movie.  it isn't the greatest, but it is clean and it is reasonably priced compared to the area megaplexes.  like the nearby manor, they'll play the occasional "art" or "inide" flick.  the squirrel hill and the manor are usually the theatres of choice for my husband and i.

Vperhaps the most faulty projection in town - this theater is a giant disappointment. the staff is sub-par as well, often promising to fix problems as people complain, but never even entering the projection booth. the theater is run down, and not in a charming way. the staff doesn't care about your movie-going experience, and it shows. the choices of movies are pretty good on occasion,  but it is a very rare film that i cannot find at a much better theater.\u000a\u000athis is the only theater in town where i have ever had to ask for my money back because the quality of the projection was just too unbearably awful.

Vi love that all of the coffee here is fair trade and organic! this is a friendly neighborhood coffee shop which is often filled with families and lots of little kids. they also serve some breakfast type foods including bagels and cereal as well as somewhat fancier lunches. i've had better cappuccinos elsewhere, but they're acceptable here. unfortunately, the wifi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but at least it's free.

Vi've been here several times, mainly for 80's night, although i have  also been there on other nights as well. i gave bel's 2 stars because they have a couple pool tables, a ping pong table, comfy chairs, a few old school arcade games and aside from the ever so popular 80's night they do have punk shows and sometimes screen indie movies(i've never been to either but an old roommate went and really enjoyed). \u000a\u000ai do love my dives but this is on a whole different level. now that i haved moved out of lville, i doubt that i will ever return, i just can't get over the place smelling like a giant arm pit - no matter what night of the week it is.

Vthe price is high for diner food in southwestern pa, but the quality isn't any higher, nor are the portions larger.  they're across from the harley davidson dealership by allegheny county airport.\u000a\u000athe gimmick of the restaurant would be the "saucy" attitude of the wait staff.  problem is, i don't enjoy the gimmick; if the staff is jokingly rude but never lets up, and the food is the same quality/portions as other places i'd go, but the prices are slightly higher...\u000a\u000adunno.  my immediate takeaway was "if i was trying to feel younger and bought a harley for that reason, i imagine this is one of the places i'd wind up eating on a semi-regular basis."\u000a\u000a2-stars.  there wasn't anything wrong with the food, and i'd probably eat there again if someone asked me to meet them there, if they were really set on it.

Vafter reading the two reviews before mine, i had some high expectations of taiwan cafe. a few reasons: 1) i love taiwanese food, 2) my dad is hard-core taiwanese, 3) this location used to hold winner's, where i enjoyed many good meals in college, 4) i was looking for a good rose tea alternative. so i went one day and had the tofu with broccoli (i was on a meatless lent diet at the time) and it was pretty good. not exceptional, but then again it was a simple dish. the second time i came here i wanted to try something that i believe is a taiwanese staple. i ordered the pork chop over rice - a simple yet delicate dish. what's special about this dish is that although it's "just a pork chop", to get the perfect deep fried consistency takes the perfect batter, the perfect amount of batter, and the perfect frying time. that dish alone was a 1.5 star. i wouldn't order it again. \u000a\u000asome things i would disagree with from the previous reviews: the menu is not large, it is a normal size for a take-out restaurant. they have some selection of authentic dishes, but most are pretty common chinese restaurant selections. this is definitely not the best place. it may be a good place to scratch an itch for some taiwanese food craving, especially if there's a particular dish you can't find elsewhere; but, i would hope that the standard for taiwanese food would be better. perhaps it's such a rare find in pittsburgh that we're lowering our standards? \u000a\u000ahey, there's no shame in liking a 3-star restaurant, as long as we remain honest with ourselves. yes, i think taiwan cafe is good, and i will continue to eat there. but i will not give stars where stars are not due.\u000a\u000aother useful information: the old winner's booze fridges still exist, so you can still choose from a huge selection of 40s. the prices are fair, especially if you get the lunch special. order at the counter and seat yourself. and, if it's your first time there and you find yourself walking down a sketchy staircase, you're going the right way!

Vdirty.\u000a\u000athe place looks sketchy upon entering, you have to trek down some steps to a basement where i expected to find buffalo bill then you realize its just the citys finest picking up some 40's. i ordered general tso's tofu. it was fried too long, hard on the outside and grease squirted into my mouth when i bit into it. maybe the cook was having a bad day or another dish would be more successful but after that experience i'm not really willing to find out!

Vive been on a mission to go to places i gave low ratings to and give them another chance, so this is what brought me to taiwan cafe. its still dirty-   i don't care how many years they've been selling food to college kids, what! they can't wipe down their counter and table tops? anyway, on to the food, i ordered the salt and pepper tofu - it took forever to come out and when it did i wanted to add some sirachi to my rice, what i squirted into my container was more like sirachi flavored water. when i opened up my tofu what i found was tiny cubes of dried out tofu and limp broccoli which was just as dry. i tasted the tofu and spit it out, i was disgusting. somehow they managed to suck out all the moisture and there was no sauce for the dish...nothing! dry tofu, dry limpy broccoli and equally dry rice (even with the sirachi water). all i could do to save this meal was take it home and mix it with some curry sauce i had bought at trader joes. after some simmering it was actually edible but i have learned my lesson and will not return to tc in the future.

Vthe food is good, but the service and atmosphere is terrible.\u000a\u000ai have been to this place a few times, and it's always slow and there's not usually a table available to sit down at.  they sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go, but beware--boone's farm is quite literally the top shelf.\u000a\u000athe staff is very rude--on my last visit, they messed up my order and gave me general tso's chicken instead of tofu.  the counter lady was pretty mean to me when i asked for it to be remade.\u000a\u000ashe then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who did order chicken (after me), but who didn't want to take it because i had ordered "extra spicy" and he didn't want spicy food.  the cashier laughed at him, argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him, and in the end got him take my messed up order, reluctantly.\u000a\u000ashe then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that i ordered.\u000a\u000alike i said, the food is good, but i wouldn't go back to this place.  there are too many other asian restaurants in oakland where they don't make it difficult to get what you ordered!

Vi had dinner here last night with my sis' and parents.  it's only a couple blocks from mom's house, so i was hoping for good things in such a convenient locale'.  we had reservations for 7pm and it's a good thing, because i didn't notice many empty seats in the house.  it's in a big converted house and has two floors for dining and i think a private space on the third floor.  the space is beautiful we enter the front door into the first dining room and are greated warmly by the host who is wearing a suit and has a warm smile.  the other staff that notice us also go out of there way to turn and smile.  he takes the coats and leads us upstairs.  there is a bar with a couple stools on the first floor, but this isn't the type of place where you'd be eating at the bar.  there are white linens, great lighting, interesting pictures and overall just a truly beautiful atmosphere.  we are seated on the second floor at a great seat in the corner and the waiter arrives quickly to fill our glasses and give me the wine list.  the list seemed okay, i'd prefer a few more selections.  we start with a bottle of some type of syrah for $52, he brings it over and leaves this beautiful decanter on the table.  we then place our order.  we'll start with fried zucchini and greens and beans.  the waiter brings over some bread.  the bread was good quality, but cold.. a small pet peeve of mine.  it was served with this delicious olive oil mixture that was placed in the middle of the table with a miniature ladel.  the olive oil is delicous too many seasonings to mention and also smoked garlic which was nice when squooshed (sp?) onto the bread.  the apps' arrive.  the fried zucchini is meh', i mean really disappointing.  it's cut up little squares with heavy breading and no flavor.  i've had much better at chain restaurants.  the escarole and beans however were delicious lots of garlic and good quality tasty sausage.  we are then brought a nice light salad of microgreens and balsamic.  the salad also has a few interesting components like edamame?? and sunflower seeds.  i don't eat salads, but i was told it was quite nice.  then they brought us a pasta dish.  it was to die for,,, i mean i guess it should be since it's a fine dining italian, but i was blown away.  it's a small serving of house made pasta and a nice creamy tomatoe gravy.  it was really really good.  then our entrees' arrive.  i ordered the sablefish, sis' had the veal picatted, dad had the cajun mahi mahi and mom had the veal chop.  i'll start wth the fish.  i didn't expect that i would have one of the best pieces of fish of my life in an italian joint, but i did.  and, i'm no rookie.  i mean one of the best, maybe the best piece of fish i've ever had.  it was a deep rich buttery fish with a beautiful butter buerre blanc.  think of the best piece of monkfish or mayble lobster you've ever had and that will give you a small sense of how good this was.  dad's mahi wasn't that good.  it was overcooked, dry and relatively flavorless.  heather's veal picatta was really good and cooked perfectly with a healthy topping of capers.  mom's veal chop was good, but not even in the same zip code as jonathan's at alla famiglia.  however, jonathan will charge you about twice as much for his.  they also made me a nice stiff dirty martini and dad was a little annoyed that they didn't have guiness (i hear ya dad').  they didn't have much of a selection.  he settled on a heineken.  the service was slow and we decided to get dessert to go.  we often found ourselves waiting for things throughout the night.  overall, a very good restaurant.  it the wine and beer selection was better, the service a bit quicker it would come close to 5 stars.  i think the prices overall are reasonable.  there really is no reason to get apps' and if you skip the wine.  you can have a delicious meal with bread, salad, pasta and entrees' for around $30.  that's value.  i'll go again.

Vi think this place just might be the latest addition to my pittsburgh favorites lineup.  the service is fabulous, and the food, even more so.  i also love that it is pretty old school pittsburgh, what with the "older" crowd and decor.  the chef even comes out to everyone to say hi and to ask if they enjoyed their meal!  classy.\u000a\u000athe food is fabulous.  i had the skirt steak, which was the size of my face, i kid you not.  sometimes, size compensates for other things, but my friends, this was a serious steak.  absolutely delicious.  i think i managed to finish only about half of it, which is understandable given that i also had a salad and a pasta course (all included in the meal) beforehand.  i also want to give a shout out to the pasta course - it was delicious the night of, and when i had the leftovers, it was even better.  \u000a\u000awe weren't able to deal with any dessert since we were pretty much popping out of our pants by the end of the night, but now that i know, i'm going to try and pace myself a little better next time.  i'm salivating already.

Vrick brought me here for my valentine's night dinner on saturday, february 18.  yes, four days later.  unfortunately i had to be out of town, san antonio to be exact for two weeks and that included valentine's day.  \u000a\u000abut o did he promise me a really nice dinner when i returned!  their menu promises "warm romantic fine dining in the true tambellini family tradition." and they are not kidding.  \u000a\u000awe began our dinner with some antipasta--sauteed calamari.  hey, i'm 50% italian and my guy is 100%.  we both love a great calamari and i'd been craving it since san antonio.  this was the sort of calamari that just slowly melts in your mouth as you eat it, it was that succulent.  for my insalate i went for the mozzarella salad--\u000afresh mozzarella, tomato, oasted peppers and mixed greens.  heavenly!  \u000a\u000aone thing that sets joseph tambellini apart from some of the others is that they make their own pasta by hand here.  and believe me, it shows folks.  their \u000amafalda caprese was like none i've ever had before.  the grilled chicken was just right, the tomatos fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  rick went for the veal chop which just smelled divine!  this thing was a 16-oz'er and he ended up bringing some of it home.  \u000a\u000aah, but what is an italian dinner without dolce?  they've got a butterscotch poundcake with vanilla bean ice cream, and candied pecans with butterscotch sauce.  oh how tempting that looked, but just a bit much.  rick and i split a wonderful cannoli though, which topped off that dinner perfectly.  \u000a\u000athe atmosphere and service here are just impeccable.  joseph tambellini has three floors, each with a different decor.  rick got us a table on the first floor, which has a much more traditional setting--just the way i like it.  \u000a\u000aso my valentine's day was a little delayed. but with that dinner, it was s-o-o-o worth the wait.  and the night was still young too.

Vdo you love music?  are you tired of lady gaga or pink or the jonas brothers ad nauseum?  does the thought of the same 50 classic rock songs over-and-over (as excellent as those songs are) make you wish you had some paint to watch dry? \u000a\u000ado you remember when wdve played new music along with classic rock?  do you remember when they played nirvana, cracker, dada, and the lemonheads alongside the beatles and the who?  remember when shows like "brave new world" were at their peak?\u000a\u000awell come on over to wyep!  if your tastes are as eclectic as mine, then they got ya covered!  just in the past hour alone, i listened to chuck prophet, tracey chapman, stray cats, pj harvey, citizen cope, delbert mclinton, suzanne vega, marvin gaye and the dave matthews band.  \u000a\u000asome of my favorite programs include "an american sampler with ken batista" in which he covers new and traditional folk music; "the roots and rhythm mix with kit strecker" in which she showcases traditional bluegrass, country, and americana; and the afternoon mix and evening mix.  wyep also carries npr staples like "this american life."\u000a\u000awyep has a preset on our car radio and is a staple in the susan d. house.  if you like intelligent programming and your tastes in music have matured into an eclectic mix, then this is the station for you.

Vgreat station! i know you need memberships to stay alive but do you have to have membership drives every week. and beg during every commercial break. its pretty irritating to already established members. some of the djs have really obnoxious voices as well and they are usually the ones that talk the most. more music and less talk may get you the memberships you need.

Vthe decor is great, the bartenders are pretty and the music is good but the drinks are awful and the crowd could use some seeding out for a place calling itself an ultra lounge. if this is a martini bar, then they should know how to make one, no? a dry martini here is a glass full of olive brine that the bartender will cheerfully tell she just got from the garnishes bin because she couldn't find the other stuff they use...

Vthis place initially reminded me hugely of a bar in champaign-urbana (my problem, not theirs) so i panicked for a minute, but eventually realized that the bar it reminded me of 1) never had anyone in it and 2) never had any drag queens on the plasma screens, so then i relaxed.  \u000a\u000athe drinks had tons of alcohol!!

Vi'm not quite sure on this place just yet.  i know it's aimed to be a nice lounge type of setting, but then why is there a dj booth but hardly a dance floor?\u000a\u000adrinks are reasonably priced, a plus.  space however is not reasonable, a minus.  it's like once you get in there and order a drink you are funneled into the crowd.  a narrow walkway to get to the other end of the bar isn't fun.  especially when you have to battle the other people coming from the opposite direction.  too many people standing near the bar/bar stools, too many people standing near the booths.  i do give them props because when you're bumping and grinding your way though there to make it to the back they don't seem to mind.\u000a\u000athe small back patio never seems to be crowded, probably because it's the smoker's haven.  sometimes it's a good place to go if you wanted to carry on a conversation.  \u000a\u000athe staff are quite nice, yes they do get busy, but they seem to remember who was at the bar in what order.  never paid a cover here, huge plus.

Vgreat atmosphere, the bartenders are awesome, fabulous music videos for your viewing and listening pleasure, and there's a quaint patio for nice weather. \u000a\u000aspin is in a nice area with plenty of other places to go for shopping, grub or drinks. the clientele is sophisticated and more mature than the crowd at 5801 (don't get it twisted, i do love both establishments equally).\u000a\u000athere is a decent selection of bottled beer and they do have a limited menu that i have not had the opportunity to explore.

Vthe bar totally exceeded my expectations! \u000a\u000a the boyfriend and i were driving through the south side and starving, at first we were going to the real mccoy sandwich shop, but it's really not a sit down place...seeing that they have no tables. so we walked a little further to the bar, it was a rainy friday evening and there weren't that many patrons. i was stunned the interior appeared so swank (remember, we're on carson street).\u000a\u000ai thought the service was incredibly slow, 10 minutes and no one came to get our drinks but jb had noticed on the way in there was a help wanted sign and the bartender was doing double duty, manning the dining area as well.\u000a\u000athe menu is mostly burgers and such. for starters we had the fried crab ravioli with cajun aioli...it was delicious, but if i could change one thing, i would use an old bay aioli and more of it! either way those were some very tasty pasta pockets filled with real lumps of crab, not that pink and white imitation garbage. for entrees, i had a veggie sandwich with fries, the fries were really, really good and the sammie was good but not special...i can get a roasted veggie sandwich anywhere these days, i must say though, the bar's is pretty stellar. jb had a burger which he was quite pleased with. i would have been in heaven if i actually ate beef, their burger selection is eclectic and includes a greek burger...put the word "greek" in front of anything and i'm in\u000a\u000ato sum it up - service may have been slow but one man can only do so much...he was friendly and efficient,considering he was basically holding shit down on his own, our server did a great job. the food was fantastic, inexpensive and plentiful. we would definitely return.

Va small local brewery where you can buy growlers or kegs. hard to spot from the outside as there is no obvious sign; on the inside there is barely room to stand while you sample the beers before buying. good beer, and they're friendly... the company uses environmentally responsible practices, and the shirts they sell are even organic cotton.

Vthis is as good as it gets.\u000a\u000ait's in a warehouse building off the beaten path, where the only sign is "east end brewing" written with a sharpie on the door in inch high letters; they get most of their business, i think, from selling directly to bars.  \u000a\u000athree or four times a week, they have growler hours; you can stop by and buy a growler for $3.  (a growler is a half gallon glass jug.)   for $12, they'll fill it for you, you can take it home, and it'll keep for a good while in the fridge.  it's pretty much exactly a sixpack of beer.\u000a\u000athey had seven or eight varieties of beer - and one cider - available today, and most of them were great.  ale heavy - not sure they're setup to make lager - they had great ipa, brown ale, stout, winter ale, and a belgian ale that was something i gladly paid for.  \u000a\u000awhile you're standing around, you can sample any of the beers; they'll give you 1/4 pint pours of anything on tap until you know what you want to buy.  it's not a restaurant, it's not a bar; there are no seats.  if they're not busy, sounded like they're always glad to show off the brewing setup in the next room.\u000a\u000ait was also interesting to hear about how many (most/all?) of the ingredients are locally sourced, and they manage to recycle all of the waste products back into the community.  (extra yeast goes to bakers.  extra bags go to a mulch company.  everything out the door is recycled/reused.)  the cider for the apples came from trax farms in finleyville.\u000a\u000athe big hop is their flagship beer; it's a ale that's been both heavily hopped and then heavily dry hopped, to give it the bitter ipa flavor with a lot of aromatics as well.  a++.  the winter ale they have tastes a bit like a homebrew to me.  the cider is oustanding, as it's not straight granny smith, but has a significant amount of green and red apples in the mix.  the monkeyboy hefeweisen was very good, and the second run of their 2010 barleywine was the "bitter end", which was a great light ale.\u000a\u000awill go again.

Vi love everything east end brewery stands for - local microbrew, green operations, active twitter and a website. you can even volunteer at the brewery for a truly immersive experience. \u000a\u000athe place is hard to find and is not in the best neighborhood but if you turn right after the overpass/bridge and slowly creep along the building wall, you'll see the door and some people. and then you'll see the small sign. \u000a\u000ait was actually pretty crowded inside - a room full of older men that looked like they're just coming back from work. their growlers are a great deal, $12-15 for 1.5 liters of beer (with the growler, when you bring it back next time you get $3 off or so) you can also taste all the beer on tap, and the tastes are generous - try all five and you'll have a nice buzz going. in the back of the place, they have some bottles beers and merchandise (pint glasses, shirts, etc).

Vlocated in homewood, east end brewery is as local as it gets. you walk through a small door, find a makeshift bar, and can walk right back to the vats. bartenders are friendly during growler hours, samples are generous, and growlers are reasonably priced.\u000a\u000anote: cash only & tip the bartender (they're volunteers).

Vsince east end brewing company has moved to a new location, it's time to update my review. this is still some of the best local beer available in pittsburgh, but now rather than having to sample it in a cramped hallway, you can enjoy the expansiveness of the new space which is shared with the commonplace coffee company. sidle up to the large bar for samples of whatever is currently on tap - the old standards plus rotating seasonal beers, ginger ale, and root beer. purchase a reusable half-gallon glass growler full of beer, and then bring it back for refills.\u000a\u000ain addition to beer on tap, other merchandise available includes glasses, t-shirts, knitted caps, and pre-bottled specialty beers. they've also started offering a biweekly tour of the brewery which is excellent and highly recommended. this is one of the gems of pittsburgh. check it out.

Vprobably the best beer in pittsburgh.  i attended a beer hike with venture outdoors and then our group took a tour of the brewery.  they took time to explain the beer making process and they showed all the ingredients and tools that went into producing the beer.  we tasted lots of great beer and all of our questions were answered in a very helpful way.  \u000a\u000ait's a green brewery, so everything is recycled or reused.  remember to take your growler to get refilled.  \u000a\u000athere's a coffee bar in the corner as you walk in.  everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable.  i'm a huge fan of snow melt and their pale ale.\u000a\u000ai really liked the other location, but absolutely love the new location.  they have a broader range of their beers of tap and the building is a lot more comfortable.

Vthe doubletree has been my home for the past year during my business travel to pittsburgh (mon-thu, every week). this is my "where everyone knows your name" place. besides being my home away from home, it is an excellent hotel. it can be pricey depending on the availability, but that's not a problem if you're on an expense-paid trip.\u000a\u000auseful information:\u000a1- with the hotel stay you have access to the downtown athletic club, which is located within the hotel.\u000a2- some rooms have a micro-fridge. you can put in a request for one beforehand if you'd like.\u000a3- apartment style rooms with clean linens and neutrogena toiletries.\u000a4- parking is not included and is $20/weekday, $18/weekend day (2008).\u000a5- bigelow grille is the restaurant in the hotel, and is an actual downtown pittsburgh restaurant. decent restaurant with $20-30 entrees.\u000a6- hilton elites get breakfast coupons for the bigelow grille (great value).\u000a7- shuttle service get you to most popular locations (southside, downtown attractions, baseball stadium, etc.) \u000a8- 7-11 convenience store also connected to the hotel. \u000a9- location is walking distance to benedum center (12 mins), pnc park (20 mins), mellon arena (4 mins), heinz hall (15 mins).\u000a10- amazingly friendly staff - they are the cream of the crop! everyone from the valet parking attendants to the front desk staff are professional and respectful.\u000a\u000a5 stars, for sure! it's everything you want in a good quality hotel.

Voh yeah! ice cream is a cheery place where my friends and i like to stop at after engorging ourselves down the street at buffalo blues.  after dinner someone will always say let's get oh yeah!, and the everyone else who is food coma-ed will remember there's a place to get ice cream down the street and be like oh yeah!  and then everyone will start laughing at the really bad pun.\u000a\u000aanyways.\u000a\u000athey have delicious ice creams, i think they're vegan.  i always get the soy green tea ice cream.  it has a great "tea" flavor which most green tea ice creams lack.  i get it w/o the swirl-ins, which is what makes oh yeah! so unique, so i guess i'm missing out on the best part.  personally i like my ice creams to be without the toppings unless they are generic supermarket ice creams because i find that toppings steal the show away from the ice creams themselves (which works if its a generic supermarket ice cream that is well, generic).\u000a\u000aprices are on the higher side for ice cream, but if you bring your own cup you get a discount, and they also have a frequent visitor promo where you can get stamps for free ice cream down the road.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended.

Van interesting ice cream and coffee shop which features tasty ice cream and environmental friendliness. this may be the only establishment i've ever been to which offers the option to wash and reuse plastic utensils. \u000a\u000athe mix-in choices are somewhat overwhelming since there are so many, but they have some excellent options such as bacon and soylent green! seriously though, some of the ingredients are actually good.\u000a\u000ainstead of placing the mix-ins on top of your ice cream or mixing them in on a cold stone, oh yeah! has a strange machine which turns hard ice cream into softserve and mixes the extra ingredients in.\u000a\u000asomewhat pricey, but definitely worth trying out.

Vi came here last fall and was very impressed with the waffles, the ice cream and the mix-ins. it's a fat girl's dream. but on a recent visit last month, i learnt that they changed their waffle irons - the waffles are now much thinner, have tighter shallower pockets, and, in my opinion, less tasty. the coffee is ok, the service is exactly what you expect from college hipsters.

Voh yeah!  ice cream!  coffee!  waffles!  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!  okay, maybe not on the coffee....\u000a\u000aanyways....\u000a\u000amy friend marla and i were doing a little vintage shopping in the area and we thought we'd stop in for a little dessert.  this is another one of them places i'd always been meaning to try.  they've got over 100 fixin's for your ice cream, but even if you like yours a little more simple like i do, some dave & andy's home made ice cream will do just fine. they've also got organic gluten free soy ice cream.\u000a\u000athe coffee here is amazing too!  mine went so well with my ice cream.  now for those of you who need your morning shot of caffeiney goodness, they even have weekly and monthly passes.  too bad this place isn't on my way to work.  \u000a\u000aas for the waffles, uh "vegan cinnamon"?  no thanks!  but that buckwheat waffle with honey sounds s-o-o-o-o-o tempting!  i've gotta come back here when i've got more room in my tummy!\u000a\u000apump that insulin, susan!  pump!

Voh yeah! is awesome - free wifi, fair trade coffee, vegan and non-vegan(dave & andy's) ice cream, gluten free(and non-gluten free) waffles. \u000a\u000athe centerpiece of oh yeah! is their ice cream mixing machine - top a scoop with whatever you want - literally, they have a ton of mix-ins - and they'll run it through the machine and swirl it all up. the waffles are decent, but i think they're a little pricey for being just that -  a waffle.\u000a\u000athe coffee is only a buck if you bring your own mug, as well.. it's a steal. the staff is also super friendly and don't miss out on the glass-door bathroom. your friends can't see you, don't worry. \u000a\u000amy biggest concern about the place is allergies, though. i once went in with my brother who is very allergic to nuts. the girl offered to clean the swirl attachment with water and we asked if they could use a little soap, then water to be safe and she said she wasn't sure. i understand this, but i wish they kept a clean attachment or two on the side for allergic people - the last thing he needs is the remnants of someone's peanut choice sneaking into his ice cream to send him to the hospital.

Vmight i suggest a couple of add-ons for the name, like: oh my! oh god! oh yes!\u000a\u000aamazing ice cream, that's all i ventured to taste.  after a large sized meal nearby i was craving something sweet.  thank god for my new found love of venturing around a neighborhood.  saw the waffle and ice cream signs and decided that my friend and i would give it a shot.\u000a\u000atotally didn't expect the awesome array of decor they chose on the inside.  i like the, as i call it, 'throw-it-on-the-wall' style.  sure does give you something to look at if there is a wait in front of you.  or maybe just keep reading the sign of different ways to have your ice cream.  i opted for betty crocker's nightmare.  if this is her nightmare, it's my sweet dream.  i was in heaven.  two scoops was the way to go instead of one.  the mixing of the ingredients is amazing to watch.  the machine is like this big ole drill that crumbles, crunches and mixes all at once.  it's like they snuck into a construction site, and walked off with a high powered drill to make such magic.\u000a\u000atotally in love with this place now, definitely will be stopping back in here.  cash is probably easier to use here.  using your check card or credit card adds an extra dollar onto the tab.

Vthe best wine & spirits in pittsburgh, which isn't saying much as pittsburgh is so behind with everything! not to mention the pa liquor control board controls everything in pa so there's no competition. the prices are more expensive in pa wine & spirits stores compared to other states i've been to where you can by liquor in your local grocery store. \u000a\u000athis location sits on the site of the old yellow cab company garage. it is on the second level of the building next to borders books. they carry just about every kind of wine or liquor you can think of. my only complaint is that if your looking for something popular they are always out of it. if it's on sale, it's sold out! for a store this large you would think they would have a better stock of liquor. \u000a\u000ai can't speak on the wine selection as i don't drink it but, my wife loves moscato and can always find it in a few different brands at this location. \u000a\u000acustomer service is usually pretty good and there's always someone from a different liquor company in the store offering samples.\u000a\u000ainsider tip: this is one of the few wine & spirits stores open on sundays.

Vhow to rate a pa liquor store? i originally planned on giving this place two stars, because pa's liquor and wine monopoly forces us to buy from these poorly stocked state stores, and even this - probably the best w&s in pittsburgh - pales in comparison to meager liquor stores in other states near and far.\u000a\u000aafter some consideration, though, i accepted that my yelp review will not force pennsylvania legislators to reconsider the plcb, and giving this shop 2 stars would only (potentially) deter people from coming here and going to even worse stores in the area.\u000a\u000athis liquor store is large and fairly nice inside. as you walk in there is a little corral of advertised wines showing the chairman's thoughts on the flavors, body, and sweetness of the wine - along with how much you're saving over the msrp. beyond that it is a normal large w&s. 2/3 of the store is wine, not so greatly laid out in my opinion, but you can find what you need. the last 1/3 is liquors.\u000a\u000abe on the lookout for the sale tags. if you want to plan ahead, the sales run monthly and are published on the plcb website. the cashiers here are friendlier than most state stores i've been in, although that's not to say i haven't run into some more standard fare behind the register.\u000a\u000aso if you're stuck in pa, this is the place you'll find what you need. also, it's a "premium selection" store - meaning it is open until 5pm on sundays

Vthis is by far one of the newest and nicest wine and spirits in the city.  the selection is the best by far than any other shop in the city.\u000a\u000ait is huge and well lit.  i have to say that it was difficult to make a selection on wine in here because of the vast selection they had.  not only that, but how the aisles are set up.  some aisles end without explanation.  you expect to reach the end of an aisle and walk to the next as you swing around the end of it.  not so in here.  it appears that their specials for the week make up a makeshift wall, so unless you are a track star that jumps hurdles, you won't be able to get past here without walking back down to the end of the aisle.\u000a\u000aif you are in the mood for wine, they do have a section called the cellar with chilled wines to choose from.  \u000a\u000ai also have to say that people mean business in here if they go shopping with a cart.

Vi was here last night with a couple friends.  it's a decent place to go for drinks and the food and service is about average.  if you are in the city this is a decent standby.  the parking is indoor.  the entrance to the building is down one floor from the first lot when you pull in to the garage, so drive down one level before parking.  i always forget and park on the wrong level.  the entrance is nice and hostess is usually smiling.  the bar area is huge and probably my favorite part of the restaurant.  i rarely sit in the dining area unless i'm having an event and use the private dining areas in the back.  there is plenty of space at the bar, plus mulitiple hi-tops and nice leather lounge seating to be had.  the lighting is nice and the floor to ceiling windows give it a nice roomy feel.  this is a franchise, but it's a small one not like a mortons or ruths.  the bartender was a nice enough guy, but not overly friendly which is fine since i was here with friends, but i'm sure some of the people solo at the bar wouldn't have minded a bit of conversation.  i also don't really like the fact that he was eating potato chips most of the time behind the bar and then handling olives and other food items to make drinks (i know i'm being too critical).  lisa and i arrived first and i ordered my standard guinness  which i guess wasn't part of the happy hour special because i paid full price ($6.00).  the guinness was fine except it was a sloppy pour and i had to wash my hands after handling it.  lisa ordered a shiraz (jacobs creek reserve) and i've bought bottles of this before for about $11 a bottle, so $11.50 for a glass seems a bit pricey.  we start with two appetizers.  i order the brick oven roasted mushrooms which are tasty with roasted garlic, vinaigrette and rosemary.  this is a good appetizer that is well seasoned and reasonably priced.  we also order the brie dip which is only about okay.  it is crusted with pistachio and had a glaze.  the menu said pomegranate glaze, but i couldn't taste this fruit.  the brie wasn't of great quality and it wasn't ripe as the brine was firmly attached.  i could have skipped this.  tom arrives and we order our entrees.  i order the sole saltimbocco which is one of their "signature items" and lisa orders the "sea scallops" and tom has the paella.  it seems like they try hard to keep most of the menu items under $30 and our entrees were $23, $26 and $28 respectively, but then they hit you for $8 for a salad.  so, the price isn't as reasonable as it should be.  they were nice enough to accomodate my intolerance for lettuce by making me a salad of basically tomatoes, blue cheese and bacon.  it was fine, but served without dressing.  my entree was pretty good.  the risotto was okay and the fish was cooked well.  the pancetta on top of the fish also provided a nice contrast of texture and taste.  however, it was drown in butter.  i mean it looked like a stick or two were melted on top of the thing.  i love butter and that's probably a part of the reason i liked it, but i wonder how well the chef may have done without the ability to use so much.  tom's paella looked really good.  this was probably the best choice of the night.  the rice was cooked and flavored well.  the sausage was tasty and the shellfish weren't overcooked.  lisa who had been craving scallops i'm afraid was disappointed.  if they were sea scallops they were the smallest i've ever seen.  good scallops shouldn't be overdressed with a cheese crust and a bunch of other convuluted flavors.  i split one open and the scallop also was not a color that i would recognize for this shellfish.  i guess i'd describe the color as taupe.  as i review this the restaurant probably only deserves 2.5 stars and i also notice i mention price often.  overall i paid $240 for the three of us to dine here at the bar.  in this economy i'm a little disappointed in myself for spending so much on such a sub par experience.  i could have gone to one of the many locally owned joints or even a capital grille and had a much better dining experience than this.  i think i'll stick to this place solely for happy hour in the future.

Vthe pittsburgh hilton is the first building you'll notice on any post card of the golden triangle.  it was part of the origianl renaissance plan and part of the original gateway center.\u000a\u000athe hotel itself is okay, but only just okay.  there's nothing particularly bad about it.  the rooms are small and the bathrooms are smaller. fortunately, the rooms have  been going through an upgrade.    take my advice and see if you can get a cheap rate through www.hotwire.com or some other source.   but you should not pay full price to stay here because for what they charge, there are better values to be had elsewhere.

Vthere's not much to be said overall.\u000a\u000awe ordered two combination dinners so we could try almost all of their entrees.  flavor's were bland.  some of the food was lukewarm.  i hate to do direct restaurant comparisons, but abay serves more flavorful heated food and is also like a buck or two cheaper.\u000a\u000apro's?  you won't have a hard time trying to get a table here.

Vi came here on a tuesday evening with a very large group of girls!  there weren't many other people in the restaurant.  i felt sort of bummed out for the staff, but our waiter was very pleasant and patient with us nonetheless.  i ordered a glass of honey wine, which was sticky and sweet (in a good way).  \u000a\u000ai ordered the vegetarian sampler, with kay wot (lentils), ye ater kik alicha (split peas), tikil gomen (cabbage and carrots), ye abesha gomen (collard greens), and shiro wot (chickpeas).  everything arrived sort of lukewarm, and most of my dining companions reported the same thing.  i know we were a large party and that makes it hard to get those things right, but it was a little disappointing.  the food was okay, not the best ethiopian i've had (that would be ethiopian diamond in chicago), the flavors were a little mild - even the "hot" items weren't very spicy.  the meal was enjoyable and honestly, lighter than most ethiopian food i've had.  it didn't feel heavy, greasy, or oily at all.  still, i would've liked the flavors to have more pizzaz, and the temperatures of the food to be a little higher.  i'd give it another chance though - after i spread the wealth and try abay.  i thought the price was reasonable for what you get, and parking is easy on the street in front of the restaurant.

Vreally delicious food, prompt service, a wonderful meal.  i chose the sampler plate which is a good way to get a nice variety of flavors.  the food came out quite quickly and it was all very good.  i like the decor, which is charming, particularly the tablecloths, which looked hand-made.  the music was great, although perhaps a little too loud.. it put a smile on my face.  i will definitely be back.

Vwow, i can't believe i am lucky enough to review this wonderful little restaurant first on yelp!  i have known about this restaurant for many months, but just have never made it in...  until tonight!  \u000a\u000aluckily, my friend and i decided to come here.  it was a friday night and at 6:45 pm, there was already a line and a 30 min to 1 hour wait.  we headed over to the bar which was catty-corner and waited for them to ring and let us know our table was ready.  we were happy that the wait was closer to 30 min and soon, we were happily trying to decide what to order.  i should take this moment to mention that they are byob (i love byob).  $4 corkage per bottle for wine and $2 per beer.\u000a\u000awe finally decided on the bruschetta (5 large pieces of mixed standard, olive tapenade and roasted red peppers) to start with, a good choice although i heard the melanzane is wonderful.  we both got the lasagna, which everyone raves about (deservedly so, as the pasta sheets are obviously freshly made and is just as good eaten cold as it was hot).  happily, a salad came with the entree - yay!  \u000a\u000ai sadly did not try their dessert as i was to stuffed from the amount of food we had eaten.  all that above for approx $20 per person (tax and tip included) plus leftovers!  what a great deal!  \u000a\u000abtw, the pizzas looked (and smelled) sooo delicious and were made right on the floor.  this is what i am trying next time.  if you are in the mood for italian food and want delicious food coupled with great service, great prices, and a good ambiance, you definitely need to make it to this restaurant.  i am almost scared that my review will make it even harder for me to get a table next time!\u000a--------------------------------------------------\u000ai've had the pizzas and dessert.  the pizzas are quite good (il pizzaiolo is still supreme though) but forget the desserts.  after 2 tries, i am totally happy to fill up on my entree and forgo the dessert.  reservations for 5+ people!

Vreally amazing food, and vegetarian friendly.  really was surprised to find this place, which reminded me of a great restaurant in the meatpacking district in manhattan, at about 1/3rd the cost.\u000a\u000anever been there when it's been crowded, but the service is often appallingly slow.  i'd go there much more often - and bump this up to five stars - if it weren't an ordeal to get the bread that other tables seem to manage, or a refill on my drink.\u000a\u000aif you have extra time, aren't in any hurry, and want great italian that doesn't rely on marinara sauce, go now.

Vso i liked piccolo forno.  i really did.  very tasty.  but i haven't quite figured out why people are willing to wait 90 minutes for it.  puzzling mystery.\u000a\u000awe knew this would happen, so we put our names in around 630 pm on a saturday, and got seated about 8 pm.  fortunately we had enjoyed several cocktails at eclipse lounge down the street in the meantime, so we were in very good spirits.  also, the hosts take your cell phone number, and even gave us a courtesy call when the party whose table we were going to take was "eating dessert," so we knew we had about 15 minutes left to wait and had time to finish our cocktails without needed to chug them and run out the door.\u000a\u000apiccolo forno is small and bustling.  people gather to wait in the front, so it can be a little crowded getting in the door.  once seated though, we all felt relaxed and happy.  we opened a few bottles of wine ($5 each corkage), and i have to say much as i love byob, i hate this corkage fee thing.  ugh.  maybe i'm just spoiled, but in other cities where i've lived, byob = no charge.\u000a\u000aso, i got a house salad which was a nice, simple starter, and then at the server's recommendation, i ordered the stracotto di cingiale con fettucine.  that would be braised boar with vegetables over fettucine pasta.  it was quite yummy.  obviously fresh pasta, tender meat, and a reasonably generous portion for not much money.  the boar was seasoned in an interesting way, almost a bit sweet - sugar?  cinnamon?  not sure.  but tasty.  couldn't finish it so it went in a box, and i look forward to consuming the rest of it shortly, probably tonight.\u000a\u000agratuity was included since we had a party of 7 - two girls split the check, and then we gave them cash.  but i've since heard from the two girls that the restaurant overcharged them - randomly adding $15 more to each check, even though gratuity was already included (clearly stated on the receipt) and we can't figure out why they did that.  they're planning to call and get that figured out, but it put a bit of a damper on our impressions of the evening.\u000a\u000aso it's a tasty place with good, fresh food.  but to be truly honest, when you have to wait 90 minutes and pay to byob, and the check gets messed up, it isn't exactly a perfect evening out.  so if you don't mind waiting and paying to bring wine, i'd say go for it.  but the food didn't knock my socks off enough to make up for the logistical annoyances.  if i'm waiting and paying for my own wine, i'd like the food to be outstanding.  and we aren't quite there, in my opinion.

Vreally excellent food at very fair prices.  i love eating at picolo forno!  first things you should know is that there are no reservations, unless you have a party of 5 or more.  it's very loud, it's byob, and the food is fantastic.  i had the cavatelli con salsccia e rapini, which was amazing and i will order this again.  people rave about the lasgna, although i don't think that is their best dish.  i love the crostini di polenta, it's a perfect appetizer.  the bomba is always a fun dessert.

Vbest bbq i've had in pittsburgh up to date.\u000a\u000ai ordered a full rack of pork ribs w/ hot red sauce, side of potato salad and a side of mac and cheese to split.  the food came out in around 15 min, which is okay since it means it's freshly cooked instead of being constantly reheated.  ribs were delicious.  now these are full sized st. louis ribs, not those tiny baby back ribs, so be ready to eat.  the owner recommended the red sauce to go w/ pork, which worked out well.  potato salad was the best potato salad i've had in a while.  they have a part mustard base which adds a different dimension to the typically heavily mayo-ed version (which is gross.)  mac 'n cheese was amazing.  so amazing.  none of that blue box jazz.  none of that sysco-produced monotony.  cooked with love.  yum.\u000a\u000athey're working on serving chicken 'n waffles on sundays.  don't know when it'll be out, but i'm pumped for that as well.\u000a\u000aprices are reasonable at around 15 a person.  this is assuming you're eating less than 2 pounds of food.  i think that's a pretty safe assumption for most people.\u000a\u000aif you're sick of the monotony of chain bbq places, check out steel city rib house.  highly recommended.

Vavalon exchange is one of those great local stores that makes shopping in squirrel hill such a pleasure.  as others have said, sometimes you do have to hunt for what you want.  it isn't a vintage store, per se, but they do get vintage clothes and sometimes you can find a real gem.\u000a\u000ai went here recently with my brother paul and my cousin jack.  we're in a band together and as we were doing a halloween gig, they were looking for costume ideas.  avalon even bills itself as, "your halloween headquarters".  if you are dressing up for halloween, this is a good place to look for a unique idea.\u000a\u000aavalon is not a consignment shop.  you can bring your used items in and if they are interested, they'll pay you cash on the spot.  or you can trade in used clothing.  their website gives excellent tips for buying, selling and trading.\u000a\u000ai didn't buy anything this time, but i have bought really cute items here in the past and i've traded in clothes.  i bought a really cute denim jacket here a couple of months ago.  i've also bought some really darling vintage dresses here too.  i'm getting more and more into vintage and fair trade clothing because i think vintage clothes are much better made than those from sweatshops in china.  i especially like them when i'm playing with my band.

Vavalon exchange started off several years ago as a vintage clothing shop (which i'm more into) but kind of evolved into an exchange/buy/sell/trade sort of thing.  you'll find a lot more contemporary clothing here that you could just as easily find at target, macy's, sak's, etc.  it can be a bit hit-or-miss but every so often you'll find a good vintage piece.  you have to realy dig through this store and you have to have a nose for bargains.\u000a\u000athat said, i came here today on my day off.  i was just meandering up and down forbes avenue on my own.  but i did find something in here.  see, i'd just taken over as supervisor at work and i did need a new blazer 'cos there are days when i've got to dress up a little.  well i found this bee-yoo-tee-full burberry blazer in my size and at a really great price!  how often does that happen?

Vfantastic thrift shop.  yes, you will have to weave through some hipsters, emo-goths and teens, but chances are good you'll get a great find.  the clothes and accessories are mostly new items, with a few vintage pieces sprinkled in.  for a small space, they have a lot to chose from; and because avalon is picky with what they buy, you don't have to search through a bunch of crappy items for hours to get 1 gem.  don't get me wrong, that kind of shopping has its own appeal, but when you want a deal quick, avalon exchange is your place.

Vthai food is one of the easiest to make ethnic foods at your home and have it taste fairly authentic. so i generally rate thai restaurants on how does their dish they make compare to how i have had in thailand and how i make it at home. \u000a\u000awhile the food at thai gourmet is edible, although greasy, my companion agreed that i could make better dishes than this. now that does not constitute a put-down or i'm trying to say that the food sucked - it didn't it was good. (it's really hard to make thai food poorly imho) however, as another poster said, they seem to know they have strong competition down the street where you get incredible food so they are trying to win on the portion size and value while the quality is not quite there.\u000a\u000atake the 3 star rating for what's it worth, the food is ok but there are much better places to go.

Vwe had some delicious take-out from thai gourmet last saturday night.  we placed the order by phone, and then left almost immediately to pick it up.  the food was ready when we got there about 15 minutes later.  the prices were pretty good, and since you get such large portions, your money goes a long way.\u000a\u000athe food was still hot when we got it home (yay!) so we immediately dug in.  first was our appetizer, the hoi jo - sort of a deep fried appetizer made of crabmeat, ground pork, and spices.  sweet plum sauce accompanied it.  this appetizer was really tasty, a bit dry but the plum sauce really livened it up.  my boyfriend had the panang curry with chicken, which he really enjoyed.  i tasted it briefly and agreed it was very good, better quality than lots of other thai we've had.  i got the chiang mai me, which i'd never heard of but ended up being a great choice!  it was long egg noodles covered in a wonderful yellow curry sauce.  i got it with tofu, which was cut into long strips instead of cubes, and was also a little dry so i'd recommend maybe trying chicken or another meat instead.  nonetheless, the curry sauce was excellent and abundant, and made glorious leftovers.  \u000a\u000athey also threw in fortune cookies and these two super-moist brownies!  they were probably just made from a box mix, but still - it was awesome to have a surprise dessert.\u000a\u000ai think we'd definitely order from here again.  it was above average, though not hugely so.  but our first impression was very good, and it's a very welcome change from all the chinese food in our neighborhood.

Vmy cousin and i were shopping in squirrel hill this past sunday.  since we were pretty much moseying up and down forbes and murray avenues (indeed, the only place we went to with a purpose was ten thousand villages), we took a break and had some joe here.  it has a small dessert menu, however one thing i do like is that they purchase goods from local, independent sources.  overall, the atmosphere is quieter here than at 61c.

Vwe visited pittsburgh to look for apartments, since we're moving in just a few months, and arefa's was our temporary haven!  every few hours we'd need to duck in for a hot drink, a snack, and a place to check for new craigslist listings.  arefa's has free wi-fi, reasonably priced drinks, comfy couches/chairs, tons of outlets so you will never run out of batteries on your laptop, and a fairly quiet, chill atmosphere.  hopefully we will get an apartment in the neighborhood and come back here regularly.  i'd love it to become "my" local coffee shop!

Vi went there last night with a few friends.  we had all heard great things and were not disappointed at all.  we arrived at the bar about 30 min. prior to reservation and had a couple glasses of wine from their extensive selection.  the wine prices are pretty reasonable considering some of the other "wine bars" in town.  i'd say the price is 2x to 3x cost.  i order a bottle of cakebread chardonnay at sonoma grille this weekend and the price was 5x cost.  so, with respect to the competition i guess 2x isn't bad.  the bartender was professional and i've seen her at other places.  her name is holly and she is attentive and welcoming.  one small issue was that the floor by the bar was sticky which was kind of weird.  the overall atmosphere is warm and inviting.  we were sat at a fine table with perfect lighting.  our waiter was great.  i also noticed another great waiter, raj, who used to work at nine on nine and eleven.  it seems to me that the chef/owner took special care in his staff hiring.  the maitre'd is also helpful and experienced.  okay..., the food.  we started with  a nice selection of warm bread which was on par, but nothing special.  we then ordered steak tartare, belgian endive salad, and mushroom ravioli as appetizers.  the steak tartare was delicious.  it was served with a quail egg and perfectly toasted ciabatta.  the belgian endive was okay, but not memorable.  it should have had more walnuts and cheese and less endive.  the ravioli was rich and delicious served with oxtail which i thought was interesting.  the entrees' were awesome.  i had the beef short ribs which they are known for and it without a doubt the best i've ever had and one of the "richest" dishes i've ever had.  another friend had the lamb which was perfect and another dish sampled was the roasted chicken.  thomas keller has said his favorite meal on earch is roasted chicken and i can see why after sampling mio's.  the portions were perfect.  one of my pet peeves is huge portions and this place does not fall into the trap.  the prices are more than most, but the ingredients are stellar.  there was no room for dessert.  we finished the evening at the bar with a few more drinks and spoke with matt who is the chef/owner.  he told us all about stories of mario batali and the like in nyc where he was sous chef at veritas.  we are lucky to have a chef this talented in pittsburgh.  mio is my favorite new restaurant and deserves your visit.  they are also going to start serving lunch in april.  so, you'll be able to sample the same quality without the same pricetag as dinner.

Vi really like the priory's cupcakes.  i have brought them to the office, given them as birthday gifts, and eaten plenty of them myself and they are always met with rave reviews.  my favorite is the "north sider," a vanilla cupcake with pb frosting and clark bar on top.  the burnt almond torte is a close second and always a good choice.\u000a\u000ai honestly haven't tried anything from this bakery except the cupcakes--because they're so good that whenever i come here that's what i end up ordering!

Vformerly the pittsburgh deli company's second floor...  i have to admit, i kind of miss the grunge-y bar of old, but this place had potential when i saw it.  very beautifully decorated, but ridiculously loud.  everything echoes.  my friends and i left because it was so darn loud that you had to scream just to talk to the person next to you.  it's too bad about that because this place has potential.  hopefully, they'll fix the problem.  but don't get me wrong, it doesn't stop the young shadyside professionals from showing up!

Vthe petersen arena is a somewhat new stadium built on pitt's campus.  it's mostly used for pitt basketball and concerts.  in fact, the first act to play here was counting crows in 2002.  as far as college arenas are concerned, it's a pretty good one.  the sightlines are pretty good and as for the sound, well that depends on who you see.  i'm a pitt grad myself and i've been to a few basketball games here. \u000a\u000aso anyway, i was here for the robert plant and band of joy concert along with my brother paul and my father robert.  bro and i went halfsies on dad's christmas gift, and since dad's a huge music fan like i am, we thought this'd be a great gift.  being that this was robert plant, it was a heavy sale and we had to content ourselves with seats in sec. 103, at an angle to the stage and on the other end of the arena.\u000a\u000ano matter, it was a fantastic show.  why is it that some older artists are content to coast on hits of 30-40 years ago, each time sounding a little more worse for the wear?  whereas other artists keep moving their careers forward and still obviously enjoy what they are doing?  robert plant falls into the latter catagory.  he's been expolring the roots of american music these past few years, particularly with alison krauss (which was a show i would have loved to have seen when they came through).  \u000a\u000abut this was an evening of a lot of covers and he opened up with "gallows pole", performing a version closer to the original than the one his "previous" band (the one with the initials lz) did.  so he opened up with a cover of a song his old band covered.  and to my chicago yelp friend melanie, sorry but he did do "angel dance", itself a cover of a los lobos song.  being that i'm a 90s chick who grew up in part on alt country, i was amazed to hear a version of uncle tupelo's "satan, your kingdom must come down."\u000a\u000athe whole evening was a mix of rock, gospel, blues, and country and in a couple of instances, plant let a couple of band of joy members step up to the mike.  patty griffin also provided a great contrast to his voice.\u000a\u000ao but he did get the led out on a couple of numbers!  you could be sure of that, folks.  i never did get the chance to see led zeppelin 'cos i was born a year or two before they broke up.  but i'm glad to say i've seen robert plant and i'm so glad he's not coasting on the oldies.\u000a\u000a(note:  this review sat unfinished for several days while i was recuperating from the flu)

Vas a music fan, i've often wondered why?  why is it that some older acts continue to play the same old songs year after year, touring the beer/rib festivals, and generally sounding worse and worse playing rote versions of their most obvious hits?  hootie & the blowfish and gin blossoms were already on this circuit only a few years after their biggest hits.  i think i saw an ad once for foghat appearing at a local car dealership.  the beach boys?  we won't even discuss them.  \u000a\u000awhereas other veteran artists continue to pay attention to their craft and continue to write and record solid music even if it doesn't sell as well as it used to.  they still sell the larger venues and still put an effort into their shows.  i'm talking acts like john mellencamp, tom petty & the heartbreakers, robert plant, carlos santana, john hiatt, bonnie raitt, and a few others.  they also seem adept at attracting younger fans.  \u000a\u000aneil young clearly falls into the latter category.  \u000a\u000aand that's who my brother paul, my dad & i saw this past week at the pete.  neil young is clearly an intergenerational artist.  the dad loved his music the first time around and the bro and i got into him back in the 1990s when he started appearing with pearl jam, nirvana, & others.  neil young is also multifaceted.  you're either going to get acoustic neil (a la the movie "neil young:  heart of gold") or you're going to get the hard rock, distortion, fuzz tone neil, especially when he plays with crazy horse.  and that's what we got!  \u000a\u000acuriously, the set began with neil's roadies setting things up, dressed either as construction workers or lab technicians/scientists.  one of 'em,  apparently the leader (wearing an albert einstein wig), was giving directions as faux amps were lifted out of their faux crates.  then they applauded themselves as a huge novelty vintage mic was set up center stage.  it was really bizarre,  especially when you consider that neil young is not known for his sense of whimsy.  they also played a prerecorded version of the "star spangled banner", but since neil's canadian, shouldn't they have first played "o canada" like at the ballgame?\u000a\u000athe band then went into thundering versions of some of their best known material like "love and only love" and "powderfinger".  he then went into a new song (don't roll your eyes), "walk like a giant" which addresses some of his generations successes and failures.  "walk like a giant" ranks up there with the best he's ever done.  and those of us who like acoustic neil were treated to a haunting version of "the needle and the damage done" and "twisted road", an homage to bob dylan and roy orbison.\u000a\u000aoddly enough, neil young & crazy horse did not perform any material of their 2012 album, "americana".  but we did get "cinnamon girl", "hey hey, my my", and "like a hurricane", which was the encore.  \u000a\u000athe song "hey hey, my my" tells us "it's better to burn out/than it is to rust".  ironically, sitting there i could not believe i was watching a 67 year old man on stage.

Vi tried this yoga studio in squirrel hill for its location.  it is conveniently located on the bus line (on murray!).  at this location, they usually have 2-3 classes offered each day, 7 days a week.  unfortunately, most of the classes are unsuitable for those of us who work long hours.  but that being said, i made it in for several classes.  \u000a\u000athe instructors are hit or miss - but that is depending on the style of instruction and yoga that you prefer.  even the miss aren't bad, just a style that was different for me personally.  i would definitely check out several of the classes and instructors on different days to see what appeals to you and then stick with them.  \u000a\u000ait's $15 for a walk-in class and the price is lowered to $10 or less per class if you buy 4+ class packages.

Vi really felt like i found my "yoga home" in pittsburgh at this school. i adored almost every instructor at the classes i randomly dropped in. they were willing to work with my medical issues (torn tendons), offering adjustments and alternate poses when necessary, but also challenging me to heal and build my muscles back. there's literally something for everyone - pre-natal, mommy&me, restorative, high-energy, acrobatics, and so many different types and styles of practice. you can really spread your wings & explore. \u000a\u000aalmost everyone i met here was cultivating a real sense of gratitude. it's nice to be surrounded by that attitude, after the hustle of your daily life. i deeply miss this place. the space is gorgeous, with tons of natural light pouring in and a view of the strip, downtown, and the river. it smells nice, like free aromatherapy. there are mats to borrow, which is a relief if you stop by after work, but they are also clean and in good condition, thankfully. the classes can be a little cost-prohibitive if you buy  them one at a time, but the $100 pass (12 classes) brings the price down to nearly $8 - and these classes are a steal at $8. \u000a\u000a\u000ai always went to the lawrenceville/strip location, but some friends went to the sqill location & spoke very highly of it.

Vthis theatre was closed in 1998 and presumed dead.  a lot of hard work went into re-opening it and it shows!  it is now a second-run "bargain" house and it appears to be doing quite well.  the community appears to have embraced this place.  it is by no means a movie palace, but it is a comfortable, clean place to see a show.  prices are reasonable and it is run by the bradley center, which helps children with mental, emotional and developmental disabilities. . \u000a\u000aupdate 5/29/08:  oh no!  per www.cinematreasures.org and the theatre's website, the hollywood has closed.  i only went once while it was under new management but i really liked it.  bradley officials   apparantly decided that concept no longer benefited the mix of clients that has changed since they closed their mt. lebanon campus last summer,

Vso i got a call from my friend lisa.  she told me that "the big lebowski" was playing at the hollywood.  sure, the hollywood was a little out of my way.  but "the big lebowski"?  do i wanna go see it?  are you f * * king kidding me?  one of the three big slacker movies of my youth--the other two being "wayne's world" and of course my favorite, "clerks".  okay, i was 21 when this thing came out.\u000a\u000abut it's so good seeing the hollywood back up and running after so many fits and starts.  it's still a great place to see a show.

Vcrepes here are delicious, but it can be difficult to find a seat on a busy sunday morning/afternoon.\u000a\u000awhile i can't speak to the sweet crepes (i prefer savory), my ham and cheese crepe was delicious and the coffee was excellent, as well. i think that a frenchman would be pleased with what he found were he to visit.

Vi've sampled a few different crepes, both sweet and savory, and i have to say i'm not that impressed. on my most recent trip i ordered a spinach and cheese which was bland and the crepe was a bit thick which gave it an unpleasant spongy consistency. the tiny side of fresh greens and vinaigrette was just as bland and the black forest crepe i ordered as 'dessert' was rich in bitterness. i would go back but it wouldn't be my idea.

Vwhat a great little store! i can't believe i've lived in sqhill for nearly 3 years, and i just went into this place (courtesy of groupon) last weekend. we've been wanting a very particular stove top coffee maker for a while now, and margaret's had it for 20 bucks. she's also got, as the name implies, lots of loose teas to choose from and various european sweets, cheeses, drinks, and even beauty items. the gem for us, though, was the coffee. not only did we find the coffee maker we wanted, but got some fantastic coffee. tastes great, and a little dab 'ill do ya. seriously, i've been so super productive this week mainly due to this coffee! the service is fantastic, and the prices are right, so swing in and support this local business!

Vit is kind of hard to give a chain drug store four or five stars.  they are not exactly exciting places to shop!  i suppose one always goes to them out of convenience and necessity, and probably nothing more.  \u000a\u000abut i like this rite-aid.  it is open 24 hours.  it generally has what i'm looking for.  it seems clean enough and the staff is friendly.  a solid three-star performer.

Vwell now that the medicine shoppe near me as closed (boo!) and i'm sometimes too lazy to drag my carcass to the one on centre avenue, i guess this place will have to do.  i'm so glad this is one that rite aid hasn't closed (yet!).  i prefer this place to the pharmacy at giant eagle.  \u000a\u000aso being that i'm traveling tomorrow for an extended weekend, i stopped here for a few last-minute items.  sunscreen, glucose tablets, batteries, etc.  it's convenient enough!

Vthe boy and i picked up a pizza from lucci's last friday, after a long week of work/school.  it's the closest pizza place to our apartment, so we gave them a call even though the decor and signage imply that the pizza is going to be pretty average.  it's not a pizza shop where you walk by and think "wow!  that looks like it will be delicious, handmade pizza" - you see the neon sign and think "meh....it's probably just cheap college student pizza."\u000a\u000aso we were pretty surprised when we got our pizza home and discovered how tasty it was. it had been so cheap ($11 for a 16-inch) that we didn't expect it to be so delightful.  it was definitely no-frills - no really unique twists or artisan toppings - but the flavor somehow encompassed everything i like about pizza.  the slices tasted familiar; the way the sauce and cheese and pepperoni tasted together reminded me of delicious pizzas i've had in childhood.  it almost tastes nostalgic.  that explanation really doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's how it tasted to me.\u000a\u000awe ate almost all of it, and reheated the rest the next day - still delicious!  we still haven't ordered from the more expensive shops down the street, and i'm sure we will one day, but it's nice to know that we don't need to pay a lot of money or go a long distance to get such a nice, classic pizza.

Vi am a bit confuzo, since when i read my last review (written but a month ago!) i go on and on about the deliciousness of our pizza....yet when we got some last saturday night, we were both a bit more underwhelmed.\u000a\u000athe pizza wasn't too different - tasted a little less fresh and delicious for some reason - but it was really the wings that bummed us out.  we got a dozen hot wings, and we were both displeased.  they had a soggy texture, mealy on the outside (maybe from the soaked breading?) that just wasn't appealing.  it may just be our preference for unbreaded wings, but we were disappointed by them.  threw the last one or two away instead of saving them for later, since we just weren't really interested in eating them again!\u000a\u000ai'm sure we'll get the pizza again since it's right by our apartment, but definitely no more wings.

Vthis theatre gets four stars from me because of its wonderful marquee.  you can see a picture of it here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/60179646@n00/109899834/\u000athe interior isn't quite as spectacular, but it is still pretty nice.  were it not for the marquee, i would give it three stars.  they have 10 screens here and three of them are for art and foriegn films.  i come here if the film i want to see is not playing at the squirrel hill or the manor.\u000a\u000ahere is another view http://www.southsideworks.com/ of the theatre.  the theatre is part of a new entertainment, dining, and office district built a few years ago.

Vof the two cinemas built on the site of former steel mills (the other is amc loews waterfront 22), i like this one better.  it's less of a madhouse and it seems to be better maintained.  i went here on friday night to see "the hangover" with my girl posse.  i would have preferred seeing something at the manor or squirrel hill, but were having dinner in the neighborhood and we were heading out to the beehive after the show.

Vforget about starbucks!  i always prefer to patronize local businesses.  although i prefer to have the "bohemian buzz" of the beehive, crazy mocha is an excellent choice too.  they have excellent coffee and teas, smoothies, and desserts.  the only thing i don't like is that some of the desserts are big enough to feed a family of four!  not good for a diabetic who's sometimes by herself!\u000a\u000athey also have free internet. i can remember when this location was called dancing goats.  it has been a few names.  i think it was called "sip" at one time.  crazy mocha has since expanded all over the pittsburgh area.  i think they now have one at the carnegie library too.

Vpretty good drinks, and every once in a while the clipper magazine will run a buy-one-get-one drink coupon.  we got two drinks - a blended mocha/espresso frappuccino-ish thing and a hot chocolate, both of which were really good and with the coupon came to about $5 - a bit pricier than starbucks.  i've had a vanilla latte before which was also good.\u000a\u000atonight i got a piece of tiramisu which was perfect - creamy top, bottom had the espresso flavor but was not soggy or falling apart.  i also tried my roommate's white and dark chocolate dessert - white chocolate cheesecake and milk chocolate mousse sandwiched between chocolate cake.  delicious.  however, these two desserts came to $11.24!\u000a\u000athe girl behind the counter was surly, rude, and could not have made it clearer that she just wanted people to sit, do their homework, use the wifi and not bother her.  i know it's 9pm.  you're opened until midnight.  it's not like i came in at the last minute.  at least try to smile.\u000a\u000atheir desserts and drinks are good, but pricey, and the customer service is pretty bad.  it's pretty bad at the carnegie library location too.  i'll definitely come back when they're running the coupons, but would probably avoid it otherwise.

Vi suppose that i like what they've done with the waterfront in homestead.  it has almost everything you could want.  a filene's basement, a loew's movie theatre, tgifridays, dick's sporting goods, dave and busters, etc.  \u000a\u000abut whenever i come here, i feel a little unsettled.  you see, this was once the site of a mammoth us steel mill, the homestead works.  when it closed down, homestead really shrivelled up and the land sat vacant for many years.  i used to see this wasteland every time my family went to kennywood.  i wonder how many people know that this was once the site of one of the bloodiest labor battles in us history.  henry frick attempted to break the union  and in april 1892 had contracted with the pinkerton national detective agency to provide security at the plant. his intent was to open the works with nonunion men on july 6. knox devised a plan to get the pinkertons onto the mill property. with the mill ringed by striking workers, the agents would access the plant grounds from the river.  the union laborers were ready for them though and were armed.  in the end, several men on each side were killed and the union actually lost in this case.  \u000a\u000ajoe grusheckey and the houserockers did a song memorializing homestead.  a portion of which goes:\u000a\u000a"heard about frick and carnegie the day the river ran red\u000ahow the union caved in, in homestead\u000a\u000ait was more than a job it was my family\u000ai got married, settled down, bought a home\u000aand in the bars down the street, in the late summer heat\u000ayou never had to feel alone\u000a\u000ai got work tearin' those old mills down\u000auntil there's nothing left but the sweat and blood in the ground\u000aat night we tuck our little babies in bed\u000awe still pray to the red, white and blue in homestead\u000ai'm still livin' in homestead"\u000a\u000aas i walk along the waterfront of homestead, i wonder how many locals this has benefitted.  no doubt that jobs were created and valuable land put back to use.  but replacing the good jobs once held by millworkers with part-time retail jobs?

Vah, the waterfront, hated and loved by all in sq hill, greenfield and homestead. as john b noted, getting there is a total crap shoot.  will it be 10 minutes, or will there be someone actually driving 25 mph over the bridge? who knows!\u000a\u000athe waterfront itself is fine, though overall not very walkable. if you took the bus there and have errands at macy's and best buy, plan on a solid 30 - 45 minutes of walking to get back to the bus stop. \u000a\u000athere are plenty of stores and restaurants to keep you entertained, though.  some of my favorite stores are ann taylor loft, macy's, & tj maxx; and you can find good food at gran agave, mitchell's and long horn. i suppose what i like most about the waterfront is that once i get there, i can accomplish all my errands in that location.

Vwhat can i say about the waterfront? \u000a\u000ait's got everything you need - food, shopping, entertainment. all in the same vacinity, but so far apart. i wouldn't categorize it as a one stop shop, to enjoy all the fruits of the waterfront, you really need a car. \u000a\u000alet's talk about food. we've all heard the saying, you shouldn't go grocery shopping on an empty stomach, so before you hit up costco or the gigantic giant eagle you may want to check out what dining the wf offers. there are plenty of cuisines from which to choose. in the mood for mexican? gran agave has got you covered. yokoso is right across the street if you're into japanese or take a short stroll to p.f. changs for some chinese. bravo does italian, while rock bottom, bar louie, uno and t.g.i.fridays all offer american fare. of course these are all chains, but have no fear anti-chain dwellers - on the other side of the tracks you will find gems such as blue dust, smoke and tin front cafe. if you're in a hurry, panera, stake 'n shake, and that golden arch will sate you're belly in a pinch.\u000a\u000aonto shopping - costco, dick's sporting goods, target, dsw, best buy, lowe's, bed bath & beyond, ulta, a&f, victoria's secret, old navy, t.j maxx, macy's...the list goes on. whatever you need, chances are will find it somewhere at the wf. \u000a\u000aentertainment - movies, comedy clubs, dueling piano bars and dave & busters.

Vthis area is slowly sliding into oblivion.  it's sad that your anchor type stores have left.  american eagle outfitters, abercrombie & fitch, hollister, pac sun, abercrombie, cold stone creamery all gone.  one restaurant space has gone through multiple tenants but cannot seem to land a permanent one.\u000a\u000ait is convenient to shop there with the strip of stores that vary in variety, target, giant eagle, dick's sporting goods, petco, marshall's, old navy, best buy, lowe's all in a line, but a big empty two level space on the end.  i remember the excitement of the waterfront when it first opened and everyone flocked to the area to experience the open air shopping.  i even remember working there, it was bustling.  now it seems to have fallen on hard times, much like century iii did when it opened.  maybe blame east liberty's boom for retail or south side works.  but something needs to be done to bring people back in, several shoe/clothing stores that can be found anywhere in pittsburgh isn't going to draw as many people as it use to.  \u000a\u000athe parking lots have kind of become an obstacle course to drive through.  resembling a motor-cross track.  the roads aren't much better.  if it wasn't for the big box stores, shopping down there wouldn't be worth it.  as malls go, this one is not one to visit.\u000a\u000adining however is much better with a pretty good variety from the pittsburgh staple, eat n park to the quick drive thru of mcdonald's.  other places to try: red robin, tgifridays, steak n shake, chic-fil-a, rock bottom, bar louie, bravo, p.f. chang's, dave and buster's, yokoso, panera bread, mitchell's fish market, gran agave, pittsburgh burger co., and uno's.

Vwaiwai can best be described as modern asian fusion cuisine.  i stopped here for lunch after doing some shopping in bloomfield (i.e. donatelli's, etc).  they've got a strikingly modern decor with traditional chinese art, so it's kind of like mixing a sushi place with an old school chinese restaurant.  \u000a\u000awaiwai has a lot of neat lunch options.  you can order the standard lunch specials just like you can at any other chinese joint.  or you can order one of 12 lunch boxes.  the boxes generally have two types of meat with fried rice.  not a big fan of fried rice myself, but i did find one good choice.  #b6 is a combination of chicken, beef, or shrimp (i went with the shrimp) with mixed vegetables and general tso's chicken.  oooh, a bit spicy, but i loved it!  and of course you get an egg roll with each box.  this girl's gotta have her egg roll!\u000a\u000arick and i are gonna have to come back here for dinner sometime.  they've got an interesting way to order.  you start by choosing your type of meat, then you choose the style you want it.  you can get hunan style with vegetables, curry, mixed vegetables, etc.\u000a\u000athis isn't your normal neighborhood chinese joint.  if pittsburghers have a reputation for being less than culinarily adventurous, this place will shatter that illusion.  it's a great addition to bloomfield.

Vnot bad, not bad.  i enjoyed what i had.  why does it feel like there's a but coming?  because there is.\u000a\u000abut...the general tso's wasn't spicy enough for me.  don't get me wrong, i enjoyed it, but it wasn't up to par for me.  i don't believe i ever saw a pepper in the sauce at all.  i suppose i should add that this was part of a large order placed for delivery.  with it being delivery and all that jazz, you would expect it to come with utensils or maybe even chopsticks.  none came with it, or maybe it did, the bag seems to have disintegrated when attempting to take the order to it's destination.  so if there was utensils of any type in there, they may have been lost.\u000a\u000ai will order from here again, but next time i'll be sure to mention that there is utensils with the next delivery.

Vfor starters jb and i split the quattro fromage with fried pita chips which was absolutely delicious in all its creamy, gooey glory. i contemplated licking the bowl but decided to keep it classy and pass. \u000a\u000aas my entree (atria's is not very vegetarian friendly) i ordered zucchini planks which were gigantic and a bit too greasy but they were good, the horseradish sauce that came with them could have used more bite. jb chose the crab cakes for his entree and was extremely pleased. the 2 cakes were small but they were full of luscious lumps of crab meat and practically no filler. i tasted a bit of the cucumber salad that accompanied the dish, not bad but had a hint of an anise after taste that my taste buds found unpleasant. the salad that came before the crab cakes had the most amazing croutons. i'd order a bowl of them with some ranch if i could. \u000a\u000ato sum it up, jb was very satisfied and me...well, not so much. ill still give atrias 4 stars because the service was impeccable and the ambiance was pleasing.

Vi will do my best to not let the steelers loss taint my review of the bettis grille.  this is in my estimation the best sports themed bar in pittsburgh.  i usually swing by this place when the steelers are playing at home, but this is the perfect place to watch a game when the steelers are away.  for some reason i always struggle with where to watch the game when the steelers are away, mcfaddens is fine, guiness and all that, but the food is awful, the same can be said for calico jack's.  south side is also kind of meh' for steeler sunday.  bettis grille was crowded yesterday, but not overwhelming.  i was there with about 8 people and while we only had one seat at the bar none of us had to wait for any real amount of time for a drink.  the space itself is very nice.  it has a huge football shaped bar with at least a dozen 50' plasmas with every game on.  i would characterize the food as good bar food or close to upscale casual.  i've tried many things here on muttiple visits and never been really disappointed. yesterday we tried the burgers, which were cooked pretty well on soft buns with decent seasoning and plenty of melted cheese.  the chicken quesadillas were also adequate and the popcorn shrimp was served in style in a chinese box with plenty of veggies and ranch dressing.  they weren't overbreaded and had a nice amount of spice.  there is plenty of parking for $3 and if it's nice enough you can park a few minutes away and make the walk without the cost.  the mens bathroom is somewhat odd.  i mean it's nice enough with marble and plenty of room, but the urinals are facing a one way window out into the bar and maybe it's just me, but i findi it a bit disconcerning to think of a bunch of guys staring at whatever lady friend i happen to be with while they are doing their business.  maybe it's just me.  i think it's a little overpriced for the booze.  i drank mostly guiness at $5 a draught, seems a little high and had a glass of wine or two for around $10.  some of the girls ordered lemondrops for $8 a shot, seems a bit pricey, but i tend not to do candy shots myself.  overall this is a good place and i'll definitely be back again.

Vyou will not find a better location, especially when seated outside.  what a wonderful view of the allegheny river and the point.  \u000a\u000athere are some things grille 36 makes that are very, very, good, such as their mac 'n' cheese.  i also like their steak salad.  overall, their food is inconsistent.\u000a\u000aa little bit of trivia, there is a 2 way mirror in the men's room, the men can see out into the restaurant.  the same mirror was installed in the women's room, but with the lighting turned up, people could see in.  but they had complaints when they turned the lighting down, women complained and the see through mirror was removed.

Vmr. willie's has pretty good bbq for pittsburgh.  definitely better than typical chain restaurants.  i've sampled their ribs, bbq chicken, mac 'n cheese, baked beans, and broccoli.  their sauce is their standalone winner, its probably the best bbq sauce i've had ever.  the ribs were fantastic.  the bbq chicken i've only tried reheated, and it was still tasty after being nuked in the microwave.  eating with plastic utensils out of takeout containers adds to the mr. willie's experience imo.\u000a\u000amr. willie's is definitely worth visiting again.

Vi'm being punked right?! \u000a\u000athis is the worst barbecue i have ever eaten in my life! the owner "mr willie" was either high or drunk or both! there were flys flying around inside the restaurant. i really like the decor and atmosphere of the place. there are a couple big comfy chairs with a place to read, a pool table and a couple of arcade games to play while waiting for your food. after reading a few reviews on line it turns out that the restaurant used to be a coffee shop that must have left most of the interior behind when they went out of business. \u000a\u000ai had the beef ribs, plain chicken wings, mac and cheese and what was suppose to be baked beans. my daughter had a beef rib and corn on the cob and my wife had a pulled pork sandwich with corn on the cob. \u000a\u000amy ribs were tough. the sauce was horrible! my mac and cheese had the consistency of baby food. wwwwaaaayyyy over cooked. and the so called bake beans weren't even baked beans weren't even baked beans. they were pinto beans in some type of baked bean sauce. the only thing halfway decent was my wings which were small and cold from sitting out for hours. \u000a\u000amy wife said her food was so so. my daughter liked her rib and corn but, thought the mac and cheese was gross. she'll pretty much eat anything! \u000a\u000awhen we were done i looked for "mr willie: to complain and he was gone and left to boys there about 10 or 11 years old on their own! after spending $35 for our trash of a meal we should have gone across the street to mineo's or napoli's!

Vfirst i was afraid\u000ai was petrified\u000akept thinking i could never get \u000aa decent hair cut!\u000abut i spent so many days\u000asearching through all yelp reviews\u000ai wrote a first\u000ai learned a new salon\u000a\u000afab haircut courtesy of tiniece! i came here on a saturday without an appointment (always a plus when i can just walk in on a whim!) and was seated in a chair, ready to get my hair chopped off, in less than 10 minutes. the salon is much bigger than it looks from the outside - 3 stations and plenty of room to go around. the prices don't bite - my cut with styling was $35+tip. i'd definitely recommend you check this place out!

Vi hate getting my hair cut because no one ever seems to get it right, it's not like i ask for some outrageous 'do, i just want something basic and easy to do on my own...this is one girl that does not enjoy spending hours getting ready. so i always dread new places. on a whim, i decided to call anya to see if i could get in that day, lucky for me there was an opening one hour from when i called. i told christy what i wanted and she got started. \u000a\u000afirst off, the shampoo was amazing, she massaged my scalp and almost put me to sleep, the products had an invigorating scent...and she didn't try to shove the products in my face for me to buy. next came the cut and to be perfectly honest, i was a bit scared it was going to turn out too short, but when all was said and done, it came out just the way i wanted it to. another great thing about christy is that she didn't try to make useless small talk, she just did her thing and left me to relax.   \u000a\u000ai think i have finally found a salon i will return to!\u000a\u000afyi gratuity can not be applied to your credit/debit card...so bring a little extra cash with you.

Vthis was hands down the worst waxing experience i've had in pittsburgh. ever, actually.\u000a\u000ai really wanted to like anya salon. they're close to my house, and the outside of the building is really cute. i just needed a quick brow wax touch up and lip. i started getting nervous the second we stepped into the waxing room. there were ceiling tiles missing, exposing all manners of pipes, the floor was torn up, there were holes in the walls, and the entire room was shaking from the washing machine running downstairs. the only things in the room are 2 roller drawers, a mirror on the floor, and an old black massage/wax table. it was... creepy?\u000a\u000ai started getting more nervous as she began working. i could tell that she was a novice, and didn't have the greatest technique. i'm not that picky though, i just needed my brows cleaned up. the basic shape is there, just follow the lines. hell, i've gotten my brows waxed at a great clips before and been satisfied!\u000a\u000athen she showed me my brows. i have never, in the 10 years i've been getting my eyebrows waxed, said anything but "looks good!" when that little mirror is handed to you to inspect their handiwork. i could not believe what she had done to me. one brow is a thin line (think late '90's pam anderson brows), and the other looks normal. my. eyebrows. are. two. completely. different. shapes. i'm jacked up looking, y'all. \u000a\u000aso, i said, "woah, this one is much thinner the the other one," and she had the audacity to tell me that they're two different eyebrows so they're never going to look exactly the same. i couldn't. i mean-- what? i've had these eyebrows for thirty-two years, and they've always pretty much looked identical. i suggested we skip the lip wax, paid only for the service (i have literally never not tipped at a salon), and got the h-e double hockey sticks out. \u000a\u000anow to figure out how to deal with this catastrophe that is my face.

Vgreat place to get a quick bite to eat between flights.  problem was i wasn't sure what exactly what i wanted.  i browsed the shelves and looked at the menu.  i wanted a pizza but didn't want to look like a huge pig eating a pizza by myself and i knew i wouldn't be able to take it with me on my flight.\u000a\u000ai opted for the turkey avocado wrap.  great mixture of flavors wrapped up in that tortilla.  the avocado was nice and fresh, the bacon was cooked to perfection and i couldn't get enough of the turkey.  i wanted more of it after i finished.  but i restrained.  if i ever stop in this airport again, i'll definitely stop in at this spot again and make sure to sample more.

Vever wonder what's behind those statues on liberty ave. downtown?  i know i have, and now that mystery is finally answered for me.  welcome to the toonseum.\u000a\u000agreat space, even if it is a small space, they make sure to use every inch of space that they can.  i love how they combined the new and the old, building wise.  it's a great touch of how they opened up the wall for a doorway and you can see the exposed brick.  \u000a\u000acurrent exhibits are quite unique, and can take you on a nostalgic trip back in time to your childhood.  i know it did for me when i viewed the care bear exhibit.  gotham pittsburgh was quite fun too.  if you are there to just view, this may be a pricey quick stop for you ($5 admission for an adult).  but if you want to stay a while they have things to keep you busy.  for instance you can draw a picture at one of their tables.  maybe grab a book of your favorite comic strip and flip through the pages, or discover a new favorite.  there are many to choose from.  or you could just stand and stare at a picture and have a flashback to a memory.  \u000a\u000asmall selection of gifts by the main entrance.  cartoon character rings, small figurines, and slap bracelets (awesome!).  or you could just leave with a smile on your face.

Vhad a jarringly friendly counter-woman, which may be standard for wisconsin.  on a road trip through we only had time for a quick lunch, and i think we made the perfect choice.\u000a\u000athe store is littered with samples. we each ordered sandwiches which came with cornichons (i could take or leave) and a chocolate square (perfect ending). surprisingly affordable sandwich deal for such a place, but otherwise pretty pricey. \u000a\u000aas i approached the counter i kept finding things i had to buy, cheese squeaks (were great on the road), "orphans" (little cut ends of cheese for $2-4), beer (self explanatory). \u000a\u000awe headed out to the patio with sandwiches and haul in tow, but kept eyeing the grassy patch across the street for a picnic. we weren't sure what the rules were about drinking beer outside of designated restaurant areas, and inquired within. not only did she say it was fine, the perfect picnic blanket appeared from her hands and we proceeded to have a genuinely great meal in the sun, on the grass, by city hall, watching the protesters and chipmunks scurry around us.\u000a\u000aanyway, this counter woman facilitated a great meal, the bread is universally delicious and sandwich appropriate, though i was partial to the sunflower seed thing used for the pbj. the cranberry relish on their turkey and the jelly used on pbj were both similar, chunky, sweet and tasty. smoked chicken was creamy and the cheese was mild, but could have used a more bitter green on it. i wish i had tried the salami. across the board, my only complaint is that i wish the cheeses had been more prominent on the sandwiches, and that i wish they had some kind of grilled cheese/pure cheese sandwich on offer.\u000a\u000ai had a local wisconsin red ale (quisconsin i think?), a friend had a cider. both went well.

V3 of my family members got sick after eating their guacamole.  \u000a\u000a1 extra star because it at least tasted good while eating it.  even if it did make us sick for the next day or 2.

Va standard costco location with a gas station... unremarkable compared to other locations except that it's of course missing all of the beer, wine, and liquor that costco's in other states have. this is the one i frequent in the pittsburgh area.

Vi frequent this costco since it is close to my house.  it's ok, i mean what can be said about a costco that hasn't already been said?\u000a\u000ai have noticed how lacking some of the merchandise can be when it comes to variety.  and also how unique it can be to have bulk items in areas that others do not.\u000a\u000aa trick i had to learn the hard way with produce, don't be afraid to move the stuff in front to get the product in the back.  i had bought a bag of celery here and two days after i bought it and got around to using it it had gone bad.  \u000a\u000agas prices aren't much cheaper than the stations up the street, but it is a nice convenience if you don't want to stop anywhere on the way home.\u000a\u000a(oh, they only take american express here, felt bad for the kid in front of me that did not know that)

Vloved it!  my friend and i had 4 cocktails between us, and they all had lots of alcohol but still tasted good!  we both also ordered dishes that had balsamic vinaigrette on them, and both were sticking our fingers in there to help scrape the last bits of balsamic vegetables onto our forks.  i ordered the mushroom and brie tart with strawberry compote, and was scraping the plate on that one too.  the only reason i wasn't scraping my plate on the fish cake tapas flight was that i was too full by that stage of the meal.\u000a\u000ai also really dug the underground vibe.  for some reason if that exact same room were on the first floor of a building, i wouldn't like it as much as i did with it underground.

Vi came here with my boyfriend and my parents for an early birthday dinner over labor day weekend.  i'm on a quest to discover delicious restaurants in pittsburgh, especially some more upscale places.  pangea was near my parents' b+b, and the menu looked promising, so we made a reservation for 8 pm on a saturday.  when we arrived, the restaurant had surprisingly few patrons, but that didn't bother us.  we were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter soon after.\u000a\u000amy mom and i tried the seasonal martini, which i believe was described as a mango cosmopolitan.  they were served in really adorable glasses, and were tasty, sweet, and fruity.  we started with salads - as soon as i saw the summer salad, i knew i wanted it.  i remember a description of pickled beets and summer peaches being impossible to pass up.  i have to say though - it was pretty disappointing.  the pickled beets?  well i tasted the "pickle" but not the "beet," it could have been pickled anything-else-in-the-world for all i could tell.  the dressing had a bottled flavor to it - thick and heavy - and the salad really lacked the freshness that i was just dying for.  in the hands of another restaurant, either with a different chef or with better ingredients, it could have been amazing.\u000a\u000amoving on, our table shared the limestone lettuce wraps, which were actually pretty nice.  the dish comes with three wraps, but our server added on another (for a charge, of course) so that each diner could have their own.  it was a good combination of beef, red onion, and crispy wonton.  flavorfully and texturally, it worked for us.  then we got our next app - gnocchi of some sort (i forget the exact description but i know a few cheeses were involved).  again like with the salad, something just wasn't what i expected.  first of all, the "gnocchi" wasn't gnocchi-esque.  when i hear gnocchi, i think of a potato dumpling.  it is a thing i could pick up between my fingers and it wouldn't fall apart.  these "gnocchi" were more like.....large balls of potato/cheese/dough that were very soft and would not hold up if you picked it up.  that was a bit odd.  the flavor was okay, a little heavy.  it just wasn't really the dish we expected it to be.\u000a\u000aat this point in the meal, i got another cocktail.  normally i wouldn't, but the food took a very long time to come out, and i easily finished mine during the appetizer course - and i'm no boozehound.  we were all a little confused, saying things like "shouldn't there be....food by now?"  it would have been nice if the server acknowledged it - not saying it was his fault, but he could at least have said sorry.  fortunately we weren't starving with all the apps, and we had some very delicious bread, soft and warm, with a tasty roasted red pepper spread.  we survived the wait.  my second cocktail was good like the first - it was called the pink dragon - another great girly drink.\u000a\u000aso then we got our entrees.  i had the cioppino, which i have to say was pretty tasty.  the shrimp was a little tough, but the rest of the seafood was well-cooked.  the broth was flavorful and a bit spicy.  a tiny bit more seafood would have been lovely - okay, a lot more seafood - i had lots of broth leftover even after sopping it up with bread!  i had to take it home - i don't think i was provided with a spoon so i couldn't even eat it like soup.  i know it'll be great with pasta in a few days.  good flavor though!  my boyfriend loved his duck entree and said it was some of the best duck he'd ever had, and i think my parents got the halibut which they also enjoyed.  \u000a\u000afinally, we got dessert - two creme brulees.  they were very tasty - served cold, which isn't my favorite (even though i think it's more authentic), but it was a well-made dessert.\u000a\u000aso, all-in-all, much of our food was pretty tasty - main courses especially, but a number of things fell short, and we were waiting a very long time for our food.  i found the food to be overpriced, even the things that were tasty.  i wouldn't mind stopping back for a fancy drink at the bar if i was in shadyside again, but i think for my next special-event meal i'd rather try somewhere new!

Vthis was my third time here and first eating at the bar.  the bar area is awesome, granite table top, good wine selection, lots of comfy seating, and a big bathroom right off of the bar with real towels.  there is enough seating at the bar for about 9 and other bar seating hightops and couches for about 15.  it's an intimate bar.  it also has a seperate entrance than the restaurant fyi, ziggy is the headbartender and is really good, a true pro, the others like joe are just 20 somethings figuring it out.  unfortuantely, ziggy wasn't at the bar most of the time and i found myself asking for refills instead of being asked, not good.  most of the folks at the bar are like me, guys in ties by themselves who want better than hotel food.  we ordered three appetizers that were all four star quality, but really pricey.  i ordered the filet on filet, which was a carpaccio and tartare of prime filet, served with a quail egg and a nice garlic aoili (sp?), as good as any in the city.  steven ordered the lobster mac, which was better than most and you could actually taste chunks of lobster as well as the short rib.  the short rib was cooked perfectly, moist, rich delicious.  these apps were around $13 each which is i guess okay, even though portions are tiny.  however, a big miss on the entrees.  i ordered the elysian fields lamb, which was undercooked, and maybe a 2oz portion (for $42!!, wtf!).  it was served with a ice cold puree of something indistinguishable and maybe two baby onions.  this totally could have been just an appetizer portion and not a very good one at that, disappointing.  steven ordered the filet, which was a reasonable size (4 oz. i'd guess) for $34 with a few potatoes.  it was good, but not memorable.  overall this place probably deserves 2.5 stars.  i should have stopped after the apps'.  i didn't pay, so i'm not sure if the wine was pricey, but if it was anything like the tiny overpriced entrees' i'm sure it was.

Vby far one of the best meals i have ever had, in pittsburgh or otherwise.  my dining companions and i had the 6 course meal, which was definitely worth the money.  our six courses consisted of:\u000a1. hamachi sashimi\u000a2. diver scallops\u000a3. rabbit stew\u000a4. sea bass\u000a5. quail\u000a6. banana creme brulee\u000a\u000aeverything was absolutely fantastic, from the service to the ambiance to the food itself.  the sommelier made a great wine selection, which was tricky, given the variety of food we were having.  all in all, absolutely excellent.  i plan on coming back here a lot more (when it's not on my tab).  spendy!  but well worth it.

Vgood for you "nine on nine".  i'm really happy i have a reason to update my review and add another star. it's fitting that i wrote the first review for this joint almost a year ago and 12 short months later there is marked improvement in food qualilty for price.  the space remains beautiful and the staff has gotten even better with the addition of angel who last worked at "dish" in the southside.  she's a true pro and knows how to make a good dirty martini.  my review really pertains mostly to "bar nine" which is off of the main dining room and has a smaller bar menu.  i'm also going to focus this review mainly on the food since i noted ambiance and servie prior.  i'm not familiar with the current chef (rick deshantz), but i know he's not the chef who prepared my food the last time i was here and they may have had a few chefs the past couple of years including a brief stint of talented chef (kevin d'sousa) which i think has had a few stints including red room and a few weeks at this place.  i was here at about 730 on tuesday after spending some time at the new downtown office site.  gus, tom and i found plenty of open seating at the bar.  they stuck mostly with beer (pretty good selection of micros/imports) and i had a stiff dirty martini and a glass of great shiraz (two hands i think?), a little pricey at $15 a glass, but this really isn't the kind of place you should go on a budget.  we started with a nice generous selection of three or four cheeses.  i don't recall the exact types, but they were great quality cheeses, served room temperature with a little fruit.  the price of $15 was also pretty good for what we got.  i was at mio in aspinwall a few weeks ago and got a similiar cheese plate with less quantitiy for $25.  next we tried the "kobe" sliders which were really amazing.  the meat was extremely flavorful cooked medium rare and served with braised short rib (very rich and tender).  they also had some crispy shallots (their version of onion rings i guess).  the only thing missing is that gus asked for one without the blue cheese and unfortunately they didn't serve any with cheese.  we also tried the pate which was very rich and a good sized portion of rich flavorful well seasoned chicken liver some pickled vegetables and roasted toast points.  we had to ask for a few more toast points, but not a big deal and no extra cost.  next we moved on to the "salmon pizza".  this was great quality smoked salmon on a crispy pita/tortilla type thing served with an aioi (mayo) with a lemon/caper flavor.  they also scattered some jalepeno and micro greens on top.  we also tried their version of ahi tuna.  it was totally "deconstructed" and it looks like the chef has some fun toys in the back because it was one of the few "molecular gastronomy" dishes i've tried that i really liked.  he did something where he took like the essence of olives (puree) and somehow formed it into a gentle ball that spilled the essence out when punctured (like a soft boiled egg).  he also turned the tomatoe into some type of jelly.  and of course the tuna was cooked perfectly.  finally, we had the calamari which was perfectly tender grilled octupus with a nice light sauce.  the calamari was stuffed with some type of sausage and was also another hit.  we may have sampled something else i'm forgetting, but this chef didn't miss a beat all night long.  i am very happy i'll be downtown and will most certainly become a regular at bar nine.  a few other things to note.  for some reason they have a relatively extensive sake menu.  this is a "foodie" (hate that term) place.  lots of interesting items cooked in unique ways.  i took my girlfriend home a dessert of carrot cake.  this was also deconstructed and looked beautiful with the nuts, and other sauces drizzled on the side of the cake.  she would have probably preferred just chocolate cake, but nothing on this menu is ordinary.

Vnine on nine\u000a\u000ayour typical upscale bistro style dining experience located in downtown pittsburgh. rustic looking faux wood floors, trendy colors on the wall, white table cloths and an eclectic mix of dining patron rounded out the scene.\u000a\u000athe service was upbeat and professional, without being pompous, the wine list seemed rather sparse but i am comparing it to other large metro areas where they may have more selection, however there were good choices in most categories, although i thought the prices to be a tad high.\u000a\u000athe menu was varied and we had difficulty choosing, for starters i decided to let y cholesterol be dammed and try the veal milanese (sweetbreads) - interesting title since it was not milanese style except for the breading and pan frying of the product.  \u000a\u000asweetbreads have a very rich but blandish taste to them so they need an accompany flavor and imho a decent amount of acid to cut through the richness. nine on nine performed admirably on inducing flavor and cutting the satiety of the thymus gland. \u000a\u000afirst off the flavor came from the panko breading and the beurre blanc that accompanied the dish, the acid from the capers and small slices of petite grapefruit. a wonderful mix that greatly enhanced the balance and depth of the dish. good job\u000a\u000awe also had the beet salad, that had greens, beets, beans and shaved fennel and a goat cheese poppy dressing. first off all it was not drenched in dressing - yeah. second the combinations of flavors were good and third the beets were al dente - even better. another smashing success.\u000a\u000athe third dish we tried was the king trumpet mushrooms served with oriental style with a miso-chili vinaigrette.\u000a\u000afor entrees we had the hanger steak and scallops. the flat iron steak was served on cheesy grits and had a nice creole sauce. the dish was good but lack of vegetables seemed or color dulled the dishes presentation, plus if we had not filled up on 3 appetizers (split between 2 people, one a light eater) this dish would have been less then filling. \u000a\u000athe scallops were served on a base of corn and chorizo (pittsburgh seems to be in love with chorizo, there didn't seem to be a restaurant we went into that didn't have it as some component on the menu)\u000a\u000athe presentation was good and we got 4 large sea scallops topped with ramp aioli and cilantro. while the flavor itself was good, it was not ohhhh or awww, good, but nothing really fantastic.\u000a\u000afor desert i got to choose from a nice selections of port by the glass while my son had the strawberry sorbet, homemade nicely balanced and topped with kiwi. very light and refreshing and not overly sweet.\u000a\u000abottom line: \u000a\u000a\u000abottom line:\u000a\u000aservice: 5 stars\u000aambiance: 4.5 stars\u000asweetbread  appetizer: 5 stars\u000asalad: 5 stars\u000amushroom appetizer 4.5 stars\u000ahanger steak - 4 stars  - needed more color on plate and portion size was a little small \u000ascallop entre - 4 stars - presentation was nice but needed more flavor/ pizzazz\u000adessert - 4.5 stars\u000a\u000a\u000a4.6 stars\u000a\u000aapps, salad, and dessert were excellent the entrees very good (small deduction because of those), service excellent, atmosphere very nice. i would recommend them, but i would also be in search of a truly stellar dining experience in pittsburgh.

Va-ok.\u000a\u000agreat internal ambience, wide selection of interesting food, terrific portions that are larger than expected without being too big.\u000a\u000ai had the moroccan tuna, which was impressively plated, and had the most wonderful flavor to it, but just didn't have much going on as a whole; it needed a side dish or second course served simultaneously to not get bored with the same taste over and over again.  the tuna itself was good enough to eat raw, but probably was destined to be sliced thinner; the butterknife i had wasn't quite enough to go cross-grain.\u000a\u000athe other person i ate with had the venison, which was the exact opposite of my dish; at least five distinct flavors on the plate, almost too much going on, but pretty darn awesome nonetheless.  this seemed to be the winner on the menu, from what we could tell.\u000a\u000awas told we were getting bread, and had to ask for it from another waiter after the first course because it'd been forgotten.  they forgot a steak knife with the venison.  overall, service was slowish, although never so slow that it was a problem.\u000a\u000athe "french 75" at the bar was probably the best i've had.  \u000a\u000afor $75ish a person (three courses, one drink) plus another $12 on a drink at the bar waiting for our reservation, it just didn't feel worth going back anytime soon; at that price range, i'm looking for amazing, outstanding, perfect, superb... not just a-ok.  i might head back for lunch sooner, as that seems to be reviewed well.

Vmy husband and i stopped here last night before a movie at the harris theatre.  we sat in the bar, and got good service--although we were one of two parties when we arrived.  we each had a glass of wine and shared some risotto (amazing!) and some pizza (just ok).  it's been commented on before, but the portion sizes are quite small for the price here--i get that it's not the golden corral, but i didn't feel satisfied when we left, and that rarely happens even when i'm just eating "bar food."\u000a\u000ai would probably come back for drinks (they have a decent wine list too), but not for a full meal, especially with so many other great options in the same area.

Vi've visited tandoor indian grill twice, and i plan on visiting it more often in the future.  i've sampled the lamb biryani, lamb saag, lamb korma, and of course their naan.  with the price of chicken and lamb offerings being the same, i always opted for the lamb.\u000a\u000ai have to say, tandoor is the best indian restaurant i've sampled thus far in pittsburgh.  the dishes are delicious and are not overly spiced as most indian restaurants tend to do now.  portions of entrees may be on the smaller side for individuals use to heaping oversized restaurant portions at american chain restaurants such as the olive garden, but adding an order of naan definitely left me stuffed.  the price is amazing with dishes at 9-10 dollars.  also, on tuesdays all their entrees are half price.\u000a\u000ahowever, a combination of the interior and location brings it down to 4 stars.

Vi normally prefer prince of india, but i got a $3 off coupon through the campusfood facebook game, so i decided to give them a try.  i placed an order at 8:45, taking advantage of their buy one get one free entree deal.  i ordered aloo gobhi, matar paneer, and an order of samosas.  this came to $12.50 before tip.  it said it would take 45 minutes for delivery.\u000a\u000aafter an hour, i called to make sure the driver wasn't lost or something.  the girl who answered the phone said that their driver was very busy and it would take another half hour.  i asked to speak to a manager and explained when i had placed my order and that the delivery time listed was 45 minutes.  he told me the driver would be pulling up to my door any minute (obviously bs, since i hadn't told him my name, address, or what i ordered - he had no idea where i lived and, unless he has some sort of high-tech driver tracking system, no idea where his driver was.)\u000a\u000aonce the food arrived, it was definitely not the best i've ever had.  the samosa shells were really thick and chewy instead of being flaky.  i ordered both my dishes with a medium spice level and they had plenty of heat but almost no flavor.  the matar paneer was a gross grayish color, and the paneer hadn't been fried so it just fell apart.  the aloo gobhi was better but not great.\u000a\u000athis whole experience was obviously punishment for straying from prince of india.  i will definitely stick to ordering from them from now on.

Vthe chaat was soupy, but tasted right. keema matar just wasn't. i've tried them twice now, and both times there was something off about the sauces. spicing is heavy and not consistent with the way i've had the same dishes before. for what it's worth, i had no issues with my delivery.

Vwhen i brought my sesame chicken in to the lab today, it was met with a chorus of "where did you get that," and "oh, yeah, love cravings!"  \u000a\u000ait's that rare kind of place that has both nasty, american, super fried chinese food, and real, actually eaten by some asian people somewhere in asia food.  and it's dead cheap!

Valthough i listed the regent square under "cinemas", it could well be listed under "performing arts" too.  to be honest, the films that they show here are not to everybody's tastes and i go long stretches between attending films here.  they also have a lot of film festivals here too.  if you want more mainstream "art" or "indie" fare, you would do better to go to the manor or squirrel hill.  \u000a\u000aper the website, you can become a "screenie."  for $60.00, you get \u000a12 admissions to pittsburgh filmmakers theaters and 12 free popcorns or fountain drinks, both of which you can share with a friend.  you can also get a reduced rate on associate memberships to the pittsburgh filmmakers and a discount at the pittsburgh center for the arts' shop.\u000a\u000athis is a place to go where you are very serious about film, and as i said above, it is not to everyone's taste.

Vi can't believe that no one else has reviewed this place yet.  i've kept my membership up here because it's the best value around.  as i mentioned earlier, i'm now a "screenie" and included with the membership (now $70.00), i get 12 admissions and 12 popcorns or beverages.  these can be shared with friends.\u000a\u000aso the girl posse and i went here recently to check out a new documentary.  we went to see "anvil, the story of anvil", which was about a metal band called...anvil!  the band has been around for 30 years now and the guys are all in their 50s.  even though the story is funny in places, and the film does stray into "spinal tap" territory a little bit, anvil is a real band.  it's a great documentary, worth checking out.

Vso i'm still the only person reviewing the regent square theater, huh?  what, you don't like films that are a little out of the ordinary?  look, i'm not a film snob either!  i love the latest mainstream releases like anyone else does!  my girl posse and i occasionally get our chick testosterone up for the latest shoot 'em up flick!  \u000a\u000ano, the regent square isn't the amc loews waterfront (thank goodness).  it's operated by pittsburgh filmmakers and it's the place to go when you do want to see something a little out of the ordinary.  they also show cult films and classic films here.  my gfs and i went here last friday (april 16, 2010) to see "the girl with the dragon tattoo."  \u000a\u000ait's already the highest-grossing swedish film in history and is a mystery.  it begins with the disappearance of a young woman forty years ago from a family gathering and through the years, her uncle suspects that it was murder.  he hires a middle-aged journalist and a young, anti-social, and tattooed computer hacker to investigate.   we were there on the film's opening night.  my cousin cindy would have loved this--the owners of mystery lover's bookstore were there to discuss the film (my cousin loves mysteries).\u000a\u000aso my husband and i still have our "screenie" passes.  screenie memberships include 12 admissions, 12 popcorns or beverages, and discounts to pgh filmmakers events.  even though we live right around the corner from the manor (which also shows some indie flix). i'm so glad we have this theatre so close to our house.

Vone more reason i heart pgh! we stopped for breakfast here on saturday morning after driving by quiet storm and seeing that they didn't open until 10. their cinnamon rolls are the stuff of dreams. i made a valiant effort, but i could not finish mine. i had originally planned to eat the cinnamon roll and a cupcake for breakfast, but i had to put the red velvet cupcake in the bag with the margarita cupcake i had ordered to go. hours later when eaten in the car, the red velvet cupcake proved to be moist and delicious. the margarita cupcake was great even when eaten 12 hours after i purchased it with the salty sugar rolled around the edges. my friend got one of their coffee tumblers and used it for our trip and it held up beautifully. i can't wait to go back here when i sell at handmade arcade in november!

Vwell, the usa today rated this place as the best cupcakes in america, which got me to head there for a taste test.  \u000a\u000athe reason for four stars instead of five?  on some of the cupcakes, towards the end of the day, the cake is a bit dry, and the icing is always fairly heavy.\u000a\u000athat said, the red velvet cupcake might be the best cupcake i've ever had.  the available cupcakes change daily, and repeat weekly (monday has the same menu as the next monday), and that changes once a season.  if you find a cupcake dry, ask the employees what they'd recommend instead; i found that i preferred cupcakes made with an oil base instead of a butter base, which is to say, the vegan ones.\u000a\u000athe scones are the best i've had, pretty much anywhere.  the coffee is excellent, and the specialty coffee drinks beat starbucks, hands down.  the staff is friendly.  the hours are great.  \u000a\u000athat said, the food is best in the morning; it doesn't keep as well through the day.  the non-vegan cupcakes are definitely dry, i'd argue too dry.\u000a\u000ago here.\u000a\u000a--- \u000a\u000aupdate: they changed their hours, to focus more on their squirrel hill location.

Vwhen i think dozen's i typically think of less than spectacular cupcakes sold up in squirrel hill location.  a couple weeks ago while walking around lawrenceville waiting for seats at coca's, my friend and i passed by this dozen's and were surprised to see that they served brunch!\u000a\u000atoday we finally made the trip to dozen bake shop to try out their brunch.  i got their quiche of the day, which was made with green beans and came with a side of roasted potatoes.  she got their pumpkin french toast.  in the spirit of october, we both also got hot apple cider since it's getting chilly outside and it's such a seasonal drink.\u000a\u000athe quiche was absolutely delicious.  i've never had quiche with green beans before, but it was a pleasant change.  the potatoes were pretty standard.  the french toast was super dense and hearty and rich; the pumpkin flavor was subtle and worked to enhance rather than overpower the entire dish.\u000a\u000ai really like all the baked goods and pies they have on display too, they look so good..........  we thought of getting a pastry to split if the food wasn't enough but we had trouble finishing our own dishes already =/  oh well, they'll be good for brunch another sunday!\u000a\u000ait's great that they're so close to coca's and tamari's (which is now serving brunch as well), b/c if one of the places has an excessively long line (like coca's usually does), you can always head over somewhere else

Vbravo is pretty much the italian version of the cheesecake factory.  their interiors are so similar i wondered if the two were related, but they don't seem to be.\u000a\u000athat being said, i had some of the best eggplant parmesan i have ever had here last night and i am a big fan of eggplant.  it was even good leftover for lunch today.

Vi pride myself in being a resourceful person, so i usually try to milk situations for all that they're worth. i am not a user, but i am a maximizer. even tho the complaints about this huge movie theater might be true - it's probably crowded and loud during weekends - to maximize the experience you have to be resourceful with what it offers.\u000a\u000aas a new yorker (and i'm sure my nyc friends who read this review will appreciate this), i spend way too much money on a movie theater ticket. at the older theaters, i drop $10.50 per movie, at nicer theaters i might drop $12 per movie. this is all the time. nyc hasn't seen the days of the matinee-priced ticket for many years now. all shows are the same freaking price, except if you watch an 8am showing at some ghetto theater or something ridiculous like that. so, you would imagine the jealousy of my nyc friends when i tell them about this wonderful waterfront theater in pittsburgh, the city where i spend my mondays-thursdays...\u000a\u000aevery show, any show, any time mondays to thursdays is an amazing $5 per ticket. yes, that's 5-buckaroos. insane. off the hook. no kidding. unlike the southside there is ample free parking as well. and, it's never crowded on a weeknight. i went tonight and there was maybe 8 people in my theater. (i watched zack and miri, it was good)\u000a\u000aso, that's all it takes for me. i come here after work, by myself, with others, to watch good movies, bad movies, stupid movies, who cares. it's $5. i'll watch anything for $5.

Vthe best theater for miles.  i'm a huge fan of noon shows on saturday or sunday, which are $5, and no crowd to speak of.  clean.  up to date.  hard to find a complaint, unless you get stuck there friday or saturday night, when it's as crowded as you might expect.

Vthis theater is huge and a little overwhelming on the weekends. they show imax & 3d movies.  concessions are expensive, but probably on par with other theaters in the area.  \u000athere are 2 good things about this theater: $5 tickets mon - th, and movie watchers rewards.

Veh!  if i could rate this theater 2 1/2 stars i would.  the loews waterfront 22 is definitely not my favorite place to see a movie.  give me the manor or the south side works any day of the week.  i only go here when the movie i want to see isn't playing any place else.  my husband rick and i wanted to see the movie "earth".  rick didn't want to go to the waterworks cinema to see it.  \u000a\u000ait's not that this theater's a dump or the help sucks or anything like that.  it's just that this place is too big, too crowded (although that is good for business), and the sightlines suck.  unless you spring for the loew's club (or whatever amc is calling it these days), your moviegoing experience here won't be worth the extra $$ this place charges.\u000a\u000ano, i'll stick with the manor, the squirrel hill, the southside works, and to a lesser extent, the waterworks.

Vi mean, whatever, it's a movie theater.  i usually only go at offpeak hours, so i haven't had a crowd.  its main feature for me is that it has a parking lot.  i get my popcorn, i watch my movie in airconditioning, i'm happy.

Vonce you experience the loew's club seating, you'll never go back to sitting in the regular seats again. $10 per person m-th. it's really worth it. i haven't ate there yet, but it's on my to-do list. \u000a\u000aunfortunately upgraded seats does not guarantee that you will not be surrounded by obnoxious a-holes on their cellphones and gobbling down snacks. seriously, if this is you - do all of us trying to enjoy the movie a favor and stay home! (sorry, got a little off task there)

Va theatre would have to do something really above-and-beyond to get more than a three star review from me, and amc loews is nothing if not a standard multiplex.\u000a\u000anice big, well-lit parking lot.  $10 adult tickets (evening prices).  the usual overpriced food selections.  easy to see the screens, even if there's a tall person in front of you.  not too cold in the theatre.  seats recline a little bit, not exactly "comfortable" but certainly not the opposite.  good sound, good picture.  \u000a\u000ai mean, what else is expected of a multiplex?  we saw black swan last saturday and there was a decent size crowd, but everyone totally shut up when the movie started.  seeing a movie here with a huge, rowdy crowd of teenagers might have been annoying, but that wouldn't be the theatre's fault.  no complaints from me - but no accolades either!

Vnice sized theater to enjoy a movie in.  doesn't seem to matter where you sit, even in a crowded theater, it seems like it is a good seat.  this location has things to help you kill time as you wait for your selected showing to start.  arcade type video games and prize claws in the lobby area.  a small cafe or the bar.  if you prefer to do a little shopping while you wait, just walk on over to the shops across the street.\u000a\u000aprices for an evening showing are always going to be steeper than matinee prices, which is what i prefer to see.  nothing like going into a theater, being chilled to the bone by the ac and then walking outside to be warmed up.

Vwell i'll bump up my rating a bit.  i'm still not as big a fan of this place as i am the manor or the south side works.\u000a\u000abut kudos to amc for showing the film "rosewater".  i've wanted to see it ever since jon stewart announced its production.  every so often amc does show movies that are a bit out of the ordinary.

Vif you want atmosphere, it's a great, great, great coffee shop.\u000a\u000aif you want espresso, food, or fast service, unfortunately, look elsewhere.  \u000a\u000aevery visit here has had me run into friendly, talkative, awesome people, but i go to a coffee shop wanting coffee, honestly.

Vplenty of seating inside which is nice, and somewhat decent food. i had an americano here which was fine although the mug it came in was kind of nasty... the place is kind of grungy inside with lots of dust caked on the ceiling fans, abused walls, etc.. not my favorite place, but it's not bad either.

Vnice coffee shop with a great selection of drinks and things to  eat as well.\u000arun by hipster-y people, with a lot of available seating and free wifi as well (useful if you are not from cmu).\u000ai really like the white hot chocolate here, but have found the quality to be flaky.. its sometimes really really awesome.. but not always.\u000anot ordered a lot of food from here.. the vegan curry is pretty good.. the macaroni not so much.. they could do with bigger portions here.. would have made this a regular lunch spot if the portions were a little bigger.\u000adefinitely a nice place to meet people.. not so much for getting work done by yourself.. i found it a little too cramped and noisy for that..

Vthe pizza itself was very good.  cheesy and greasy and it surely hit the spot when i needed to satisfy my hunger.\u000a\u000abut, there is always a but, they need to update their menu on here.  the prices are way off.  from what we ordered according to the menu listed here on yelp, and what we paid when the food showed up, was really quite a bit difference.  asides from that, i couldn't see much else to fault here.  or maybe that was because they made a mistake in my favor and in order to rectify that they gave me a free small pizza.

Vi went to bona terra last night for the first time after hearing about it for years.  it was like a great first date with me thinking about the experience much of today.  chef douglas dick is nationally recognized with recognition in some of the national food magazines and has been recognized with an award for one of the best "farm to table" restaurants in the country.  he's all about the best ingredients and the menu changes daily because of that.  when you make a reservation they call you back to confirm and give advice with respect to parking and other details.  great start!  it's located in sharpsburg which is a working class part of pittsburgh.  the restaurant is right across from the "family dollar" retail store and located on the same street with many "shot and a beer" establishments.  the space itself is, well.... not nice.  what can i say?  he must really want the focus on the food.  the lighting is bad.  the ceilings are low.  the furniture is ikea or walmart and the bathroom is tiny.  the silverware is target and the plates are uninteresting.  the service is slightly above average, but still mostly 20somethings working till they  figure out what they really want to do.  the maitre'd, adam was actually very good and helpful and honored our request for a printout of the impromptu tasting menu we requested.  but, the food!  omg is the food incredible.  the food is on par with some of the better restaurants i've been to coast to coast, not the best, but this can stack up in any city.  a friend that i had lunch with suggested that we ask for a tasting menu.  we didn't even look at the menu and just asked the server to ask the chef to make us as many dishes of whatever he wanted with no restrictions.  i suggest you do the same, but kathy said they usually won't do this on the weekends, so better to try for a weekday.  ok, the meal started with an amouse bouche (sp?) which was a piping hot cauliflower soup.  it was pretty good, but not memorable.  the first course was amazing.  it was a perfectly caramalized dayboat scallop with a strawberry chutney and a 20 yr. aged balsamic.  this combination was the best scallop i've ever tried.  it was like the first time you had ice cream.  the next dish was a pan seared grouper with vegetables.  this dish was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully, but for me it wasn't memorable.  the seared tuna with microgreens and candied kumquats (what! as if kumquats werent' sweet enough) and toasted almonds was delicious.  the "prime" lamb chop came next and was the best lamb chop i ever had paired perfectly with collard greens.  the waiter then asked us if we could still keep going, we said bring it on, so finally was a kobe beef sirloin, which was rich and unlike any steak i've ever had.  the desserts were okay, but nothing special.  i actually didn't care for the lemond tart, but really liked the coconut lime sorbet.  the bread served with dinner was just out of the oven and served with this interesting cherry butter.  the pacing could have been a little faster we took about 3 hours with dinner which certainly could have been 2 1/2 hours.  overall a great chef that we are lucky to have.  the portions were reasonable and no one felt uncomfortable after all these courses and the price was about $70 each, which is very reasonable considering the quality and the fact that is byob.  i can't wait to visit bona terra again.

Vi am a fan, despite the high maintenance hostess.  the food is great, and the ambiance is cozy (although i do question some of their musical choices).  really, just come for the food.  it's not going to be someplace you want to take someone you don't know at all, but if you've gotten a feel for them, and they seem more relaxed, this is a perfect place.\u000a\u000athe menu changes almost daily (this is the epitome of farm to table - they base their menu around what they can get from the market that day).  i don't know if they do the whole sustainable organic thing, but you can be sure they got the local part down.  i had the shrimp bisque, which was quite tasty.  but the best part by far was the duck breast.  i really enjoyed that!  and a couple of amuses thrown in... quite nice.  dessert was good too, but not as good as the main.\u000a\u000ait's byob, so be prepared.  also, if you want to make a reservation, they really make you jump through hoops - you can't just leave a mesg, and have them call you back to confirm - they make you call back after receiving their mesg to confirm.  seriously - it's kind of annoying.  and they give you shit if you miss your reservation - i've never had that experience at another restaurant before, and it's a testament to how good their food is that i'm willing to put up with that crap and go back.

Vthis place recently moved up the street from the awful location prior.  the owner (mantini) is really trying hard to make this one work.  however, even though he's hired sales help he still suffers from a lack of marketing.  it's not enough just to have good food in the upscale casual market.  as far as i know they don't even have a website.  this new spot is much nicer than the old with exposed brick, fireplace, plenty of roomy seating, marble bar and redesigned menu.  they also have a unique bar in the back directly exposed to the kitchen area.  i was here recently on friday for dinner and sat at the bar.  the bartenders are pretty good with my favorite being harry whose been with mantini for four years and is a former cook.  this place probably is more of a winter restaurant, but  deserves your business in the summer if for nothing less the cocktails served with fresh squeezed orange, grapefruit, etc.  the food is pretty good but a little uneven.  the pulled pork quesadillas are good and i had the salmon special on friday cooked perfectly with a maple glaze and served nicely with sauteed spinach and green beans.  in the past i've tried the filet which is a decent cut of meat, but not prime i suspect.  it was cooked perfectly medium rare and i really like their choices of sides.  i have tried the ribs before, but surprisingly wasn't that impressed.  they were doing good biz. on a friday in the summer.  i'm guessing this new spot may be here for a while.

Vhad dinner and drinks here last night, and there were some hits and misses. the building itself is really cozy and nice, and the servers were really great. the food could use some work, though. first of all, i ordered the pasta special of the day with lobster. i didn't think it would be too crazy expensive since the price of lobster is super low right now. thankfully, the waitress told me how much it would cost before sending the order in-- almost $50!! completely insane. i changed the meat from lobster to chicken. the dish came with 2 sides, and i got sauteed spinach and steamed broccoli. the people i was with got salads and bruschetta, all of which they enjoyed. apparently they messed up another order, and we got 2 apps for free: crab cake and boiled shrimp. both were good. the crab cake had a lot of meat in it, and the shrimp were seasoned and big. when my meal arrived, quite some time later, it was pretty tasty, and the portion was huge. chicken with linguine and a vodka sauce. i thought it needed seasoning. the spinach and broccoli definitely needed seasoning. there wasn't even garlic in the sauteed spinach. finally, we got an order of their creme brulee. it. was. terrible. terrible!! the consistency was watery, there were nuts or something in it, and it was just bad. with a few minor changes to the food, namely seasoning, this place could be really great.

Vwas really impressed by this place.  the bartender was friendly, the owner was friendly, the crowd was friendly.  place looked upscale, and charged to match.\u000a\u000ai had the vegetarian daily special, which was risotto in a cream sauce with two sides.  it was the largest vegetarian dish i've ever been served, which sits well with me; i like to eat!  \u000a\u000amy girlfriend got a salad with basalmic, which tasted overdressed (2-stars), and she had a flatbread pizza (3-4 stars).  \u000a\u000awe also had a few drinks; a full third of their available bar space is dedicated to juicers and fresh fruit, which makes for a phenomenal mixed drink option that isn't anywhere else i've seen in the southside.\u000a\u000ai'll go back again, as i really enjoy a place to grab a drink that doesn't imply an all-fried-food menu.

Vthe library had high expectations to meet since it was automatically associated with bourbon & branch's library in sf. one day i will realize this is pittsburgh and nothing will compare to home.\u000a\u000athe bar was average, with the majority of patrons concentrated in the first room (as that bar was the only open one on a saturday night there). the rest of the restaurant/area was empty except for a couple tables on the patio. for a place called the library, i expected more books/bookshelves decor - they had a few bunches sitting on deco fireplaces. it was cute that the menus were inside some of the books and the decoupage tables with various comics and news articles were amusing.

Vthis is really a 2.5 but i'm rounding up only because jb seemed to enjoy his hunter s. thompson. i on the other hand was not impressed, we started off with fried zucchini which came out extremely greasy, it was thinly sliced and heavily breaded; not bad but we've had better. for my entree i ordered the alice in wonderland, a veggie wrap served with a side of sweet potato fries. i wish i could tell you how the wrap tasted but unfortunately the cheap balsamic vinegar they use overpowered everything else. the fries were roasted which resulted in them being burnt and unappetizing.

Vthis bar has the coolest theme!  the whole place does indeed look like a library - not one where you borrow books, but more like a library/study in somebody's old house.  i went with four friends on a monday night, and we easily got a table outside on their upstairs patio.  it was great to sit outside on a summer evening.  you don't get a great view from up there - it has high walls so you can't even see much of the sky - but it's still a way to get some air and escape the noise of the street.\u000a\u000athe menus are taped inside the first few pages of giant coffee table books, so all of our menus had a different theme!  one of my friends actually got quite involved reading his book and didn't want the server to take it away.  it's really a nice, clever touch.  we arrived early enough to catch the end of happy hour for $3 draft beers - they had a nice, creative selection.  \u000a\u000awe started with the billy goats gruff - poblano peppers stuffed with goat cheese and chipotle cream sauce.  and wow, were they spicy!  we really enjoyed the creaminess, but they do have a kick so watch out!  we also got the tale of ginger and pickles - fried pickles, essentially, which were okay but a bit sour for my taste.  i got some pizza, and it was a great price for way more pizza than i could eat.  crust was very thin and not very crispy - it didn't have a really amazing flavor, but it was a decent meal and reheated nicely.\u000a\u000ai'd come back for drinks on the patio - for sure!  it feels like a refuge from the other places on carson....

Vthe library is one of my favorite spots in the city. while i lived in state college, the average happy hour was from 9-11, and coming back to pittsburgh was somewhat of a letdown for enjoying enough reasonably priced food and beer. fortunately, that's not a worry at the library! \u000a\u000athey have a happy hour daily(saturday and sunday included) from 5-7 and 9-11(and beyond, for the food). yes, for 28 hours a week you can enjoy $3.25 drafts of any beer 12% abv and below, and the selection here is usually good if they aren't low on stock. also, appetizers are half off as well. sharing with my vegetarian girlfriend, we often find ourselves splitting nachos sans-meat, and they're awesome. not only is it a huge plate, but they're totally covered in well-distributed toppings. i'm also partial to the mussels appetizer, and the sweet potato fries with a smoked jalepeno aioli(ok, smoked jalepeno mayo) is super tasty as well.\u000a\u000asadly, when not on happy hour this place is fairly pricey for the sort of food they serve, with appetizers and sandwiches for $10+, and entrees ranging from $15-$30. i don't often order off the standard menu, but the salads we've tried have at least been good.\u000a\u000athe place is laid out with a bar immediately upon entry with some high-top tables and two tvs over the bar, separated by a wall into a dining area with mostly 4-tops and a muted tv in the corner. sometimes sitting near the door in the dining area can be pretty chilly.\u000a\u000athey used to hand you the menu inside of book covers, but they sadly have not done that for the last few months. the draft list is on a chalkboard as you walk in and in the dining area, but i have never found the servers to be extremely knowledgable about any of the selections. service is usually quick, and even on friday and saturday nights this east carson spot stays comparatively calm.

Vawesome place that i somehow avoided until now.  i have to just ask myself why?  stupid me, stupid stupid me.\u000a\u000ai was totally fascinated by the menu and had some find making the connections of the titles to the food.  most of the items i wanted to order was only because i could say that i ate that 'book.'  ultimately i decided on the 'brave new world.'  what an amazing idea to place the burger in a quesadilla!  less bun, more meat flavor.  the burger was cooked to perfection and a decent size at that, it almost filled out the tortillas.  mozzarella and cheddar cheese, some spicy mayo, and pico de gallo.  talk about a fiesta in your mouth.  this is definitely a burger that you have to eat with a fork.  there is no way you could really pick this up unless you are wearing gloves and bib.  it's messy, but messy in a very good way.  \u000a\u000ainstead of going with the hand cut fries, i wanted the tots.  let's face it, i'm a tots fan.  and for the $1 up charge, i wasn't too upset.  the portion size of the tots was big.  and they came out in their own little container thing.  oh my, i was so consumed by the thought of that burger still in my head that i almost forgot the appetizer.  we ordered 'a tale of ginger and pickles,' i mean who in their right mind would want to pass up breaded fried pickles.  if you've never had them before, you must try them.  who knew that frying certain items would be a delight to your taste buds?\u000a\u000athe atmosphere in here can be categorized as a loud library with a pool table...and beer.  lots of beer.  i especially like that they give you a list of the drafts on tap for that day with your menus.  i had me two while i was here and i must say, it's liberating to drink in a library.\u000a\u000athe staff were accommodating.  when we got there we sat at a high top table and soon decided to move because we were afraid the table was going to fall over.  no problem to them.  they came by often to make sure we had everything we needed.  \u000a\u000athe most awesome thing i think i liked about this place were the plates.  they were shaped like books.  i mean like an open book.  food sat inside them so you really were 'reading a book.'

Vwe were looking for a kitchen that was open late night, and we found that and more at the library.  from 9-11 pm small plates are half price, what a deal.  we tried the mussels, which were good, the fried pickle, the pork sliders and the hamburger sliders, all very tasty.    get selection of beers on tap, including a "mystery beer."  this place is lots of fun.

Voh my god is this place amazing, or am i just delirious from all the goodness i shoved in my mouth.  the flavors they come up with are crazy, but yet delicious. on my particular visit they had a dill pickle flavor and they had it spot on. if that makes your mouth water don't get your hopes up that they will have it this week, the flavors change weekly.\u000a\u000asomething that they do, which i feels puts them at five star rating level, is that if you're not sure of a flavor they allow you to sample it and then decide. instead of taking a chance on a flavor, taking it home and finding out that your taste buds hate it.  they do have "house flavors," i guess we call it that, that they have all the time.  no one can go wrong with butter flavor ever.\u000a\u000ahonestly it looks and feels like a store that you might find while walking an old time themed shopping area. also could feel like an old candy store with the wood and glass counters. heck, with the way you ogle the popcorn it can look like you're in a candy store.  \u000a\u000athis is a definite destination if you are on a shopping trip to the strip.

Vi really wanted to like this place, because i have fond memories of its sister restaurant in mt. lebo.  no such luck, i went there last night for the first time.  it's located on e. carson st., which is good because the s. side needs more sushi options than nakama.  the first thing that struck me was when we walked in there was a "boom box" blasting mid 80's love songs.  you know, journey, pat benatar and the like.  we walked in and were greeted by a friendly host who sat us at a nice table in the corner.  it was crowded which is normally a good sign.  the service was prompt for the drinks.  we got a bottle of reasonablypriced chardonnay.  it took forever for our sushi, which was disappointing.  the warm towels are also a nice touch.  i really didn't care for my sashimi overall.  the way it was sliced was very unattractive to me.  it was big hunks of fish that didn't look all that appetizing the way it was presented.  the salmon was good once i cut the pieces into smaller bits.  it was fresh for sure.  the albacore tuna had a weird color to it and while it tasted okay again the way it was cut was unappetizing.  i also tried the conch, which was okay but probably not the best thing to order sashimi style, better in a ceviche i'd guess. my friend she ordered the rolls.  i'm not a big roll guy, but i tried a few.  the philly roll was pretty good and reasonably priced, but i'll pass on the cream cheese with my sushi if it's up to me.  the lobster roll wasn't that good.  the lobster had too much mayo and we barely touched it.  the softshell crab rolls were okay, but i only tried a little.  again, i'm not the best to judge rolls because overall i don't care for them.  my friend said she didn't think much of them and she has tried many "sushi" rolls in her time.  the prices were okay, but maybe a bit high.  the atmosphere kind of sucked again with the blaring 80's music.  i probably won't go back again, too many other options.

Vwhile on a geocaching spree with my bestie, i started to get hunger pangs on a hot summer day and thought i was going to pass out so we stopped in mullens for some sustenance. the place was nearly empty except for a couple seated at a table and the employees. we decided to sit at the bar and each selected a seasonal brew from their limited, yet delicious draft offerings.\u000a\u000aas a vegetarian, i had very few selections to choose from. i was limited to pizza, salad and appetizers. i opted for a cheese quesadilla and nachos. the 'dilla consisted of cheese with a teaspoon each of guacamole and sour cream. the nacho platter was ginormous and piled high, enough for 3 people.\u000a\u000amr. sloppy ordered a burger with tots which he thought was delicious. the food came out fast and our bartender/waiter was friendly and attentive.\u000a\u000ai could imagine this place busy before or after a buccos game because of mullen's convenient location, right across the street from heinz field. truth be told, i would rather tailgate and order nachos from the stadium... who can resist that? with mullen's jacked up prices, you might as well enjoy the whole ballgame experience

Vcame here at an odd time which was kind of amazing.  we had no wait, which meant quick service, which led to a very satisfied and happy customer.\u000a\u000amullen's sits in a very nice and convienent spot that benefits from game day traffic.  caddy corner from pnc park they are sure to get ample customers during home games for the pirates and i'm sure they get some for steeler games as well.  good thing since this is mostly a sports bar.  when you walk in, it looks massive.  huge wide open floor plan only made bigger by adding a second floor area for more seating that overlooks the main floor.\u000a\u000aample bar seating for a big crowd in here.  we opted for the seats at the bar right next to the door.  greeted right away, ordered our drinks and looked over the menu.  the food is basic sports bar fare (you can read that as 'can be eaten with your hands').  i opted for their signature burger which is called 'the moon burger.'  now wait a minute, it's nothing special, at least not to me.  and it is definitely not something you would call signature.  see, it's really just a bacon cheddar burger.  not sure what exactly is signature about it?  but i will say it did taste great, but i am also going to assume that the same burger patty is used on all other burgers made here (which you can make your own combination).  the patty itself was big, filled, if not overfilled the bun.  the cheese covered the whole patty and the bacon (what can i say about bacon that hasn't already been said?).  typical toppings, condiments on the side.  comes with fries, but the thing i love about this place is you can change the ordinary fries out for sweet potato fries or tater tots with no additional fee, bonus!\u000a\u000amy friend got a basic cheese quesadilla and an order of their nachos.  i think it is safe to say that she could have just stuck with the nachos.  they are on the appetizers menu but could have easily been a meal for one person.\u000a\u000abeer selection is pretty good.  they have their fair share of ipas and regular drafts.\u000a\u000a*i guess the lesson you learn while reading these reviews is that it all depends on the time you show up here.*

Vokay, so kaufmann's has been taken over by macy's.  i accept it--maybe even welcome some change.  i came here with my mom and we did a little shopping.  got me a pair of calvin klein ricki flats and also some charter club suit seperates (both for work), as well as a couple of tommy hilfiger polos.  yeah, i normally buy vintage wear, but sometimes i've got to deviate from the norm.  well my norm anyway.  \u000a\u000ai'm glad they're still on smithfield street and here's hoping the store won't close.

Vi went here last night with a friend and i was excited to try a new tapas place.  she warned me the food was uneven and she was right.  the house where the restaurant is located is pretty cool, really dark red wood and a very relaxing vibe.  the outdoor seating is a must with plenty  of space and a covered top.  the fishpond is also a nice touch.  the service was really good with a couple of waiters serving.   the wine selection is very reasonable with most bottles less than $35.  i didn't get a chance to try the sangria, but i  hear  it is good.  the food is served a little too quick, felt like i was being rushed to finish by the pacing of the food even though the place was pretty empty.  we started with a nice chardonnay from chile.  chilean wines are really good and cheap.  the warm bread and dipping oil were about average.  okay, the food.   it was very uneven.  the bruschetta was out of this world, with a delicious thick balsamic.  the filet wrapped in serrano ham was pretty good, but not memorable.  the goat chops were a big mistake.  it was super tough and basically inedible.  goat can be good if it's marinated for a long time.  mallorca does a pretty good job with this unusual meat.  we tried a scallop dish with a bechamel sauce.  the scallops were cooked perfectly and delicious and very rich with this cream sauce.  another scallop dish that was amazing was seared scallops with three different sauces.  the sauces were okay, but the scallops were big, tender and cooked perfectly.  i also tried the beef carpaccio, which wasn't that good.  i didn't think the quality of the meat was good and a sure give away was when it was served drowned in oil and capers.  go to dish for beef carpaccio.  tapas is a fun way to dine, but this isn't the place to go for tapas.  go to  ibiza.

Vmy boyfriend and i were planning to spend valentine's day ordering thai food and snuggled up on the couch, but my groupon for la casa was expiring on february 15th.  the place looked reasonably casual, so we wore jeans.  i lamented that i hadn't used the groupon in summer, as the back patio looked really fantastic.\u000a\u000awe made a reservation for 6 pm, and found free parking on a residential street in nearby.  there weren't too many other tables of customers, though people trickled in as 7 pm passed.  servers greeted us warmly, and we were given our pick of tables.  we chose one in the back room, away from the bar.  it was apparent immediately that this room is "kitchen adjacent," so we did hear some colorful language coming from the cooking staff.  i really don't care when people swear, generally, but there was something really off-putting about hearing bawdy cooks shout at each other during our valentine's dinner.  i'd appreciate it if la casa would give a word to them about that.\u000a\u000aanyway, i ordered sangria and my boyfriend got a cocktail.  the sangria was a small pour, but only $6, and it had nice wintery spice flavors).  it was surprisingly appropriate for the season.  we shared 4 tapas, as the server recommended 2 per person.  we started with the queso manchego (baked manchego cheese), which was breaded and baked, so the gooey cheese was inside a crispy exterior.  like a mozzarella stick, only less greasy and more awesome.  very delicious, and you get three large pieces in a serving.  we then ordered the corazones fritos de alcachofas (chef's "special" fried artichokes).  there were 5 good size artichoke hearts, with a crispy coating and a few sauce drizzles.  the artichokes had been previously marinated, giving extra flavor to the dish.\u000a\u000amoving on, we tried the mejillones de la casa (mussels and chorizo in tomato sauce).  this dish was enjoyable, but the mussels were a little tough, and oddly the chorizo was softer than i expected.  it was soft like a kielbasa or an andouille, not hard like smoked sausages usually are, but i know that there are many varieties.  it tasted good, but not unique - like a smoked sausage you could buy at a grocery store.  but it was a pleasant dish, and we used some warm baguette to mop up the rest of the tomato sauce.\u000a\u000aour last dish, my least favorite, was a special of the day - octopus cooked with roughly chopped vegetables.  the octopus was too chewy - and yes, i know it's a rubbery food, but i really believe it was overdone.  it wasn't much fun to eat as a result, and i wasn't too eager to grab additional spoonfuls.\u000a\u000athe tapas came out quickly, one after the other.  some people prefer that, some don't.  we didn't ask them to stagger it, but you could try if you'd rather not have four or more dishes on your plate at most.  it got crowded on the table, but we didn't really mind.  all the servers were very friendly, with a good sense of humor, and wished us happy valentine's day.  \u000a\u000aif we were still going to be there this summer, i'd return for some drinks and snacks on the back patio and give it a second chance.  it was a perfectly good place to have a meal, some hits and misses, but a nice atmosphere and good service.

Vthis is a local chain, slowly expanding.  right now, i think they have two locations, of which i've only been to the one in east liberty.  this is some of the best pizza i've had in my entire life.  the thin crust is perfect, the toppings are perfect, and the staff is friendly as well.  \u000a\u000athe pepperoni is delicious, as is the greek pizza and the vegetarian.  this place is outstanding.  ignore the fact that this place feels upscale by it's decor, and enjoy the pie.

Vgreat pizza!  i had pepperoni and pepperoncini, which is my favorite pizza ever.\u000a\u000ait's wood-fired, the sauce is good, the cheese is good...it's the closest thing in the 'burgh to my beloved pitch in omaha. :)\u000a\u000ai actually found this place by following the scent of awesomeness down the street until someone inside opened the door.  i wasn't even that hungry but...it smelled so awesome!  and it was.  awesome, that is.

Vpizza sola offers tasty and innovative pizza by the slice, in a clean and modern looking environment.  the slices are huge, but thin (one is enough for me for a meal).  i've gotten the greco twice, which is white pizza with tomatoes, spinach, feta, and some wonderful herbs and garlic.  the crust is cracker-crispy, and they warm up your slice after you order it so it's always served at the perfect temperature.  i think it maybe runs you $3-4 bucks per slice.  it can be a teeny bit greasy, but i haven't minded so far.  by and large, it tastes fresh and is surprisingly not-heavy in your stomach.  it's very close to my work, lucky me, so i'm sure i'll be back now and then when i'm too lazy to make my own lunch.  it's very popular with my coworkers, some of whom have tried almost every slice on the menu!

Vliving in squirrell hill as i do, there are many advantages to the community.   among them is being within walking distance of two of pittsburgh's four major parks--schenley park and frick park.  schenley is where you go for statues, movies, and museums.  frick park is where you go for horticulture and nature.\u000a\u000africk park is absolutely enormous.  it stretches from reynolds street on the north to the parkway on the south.  a connector trail will soon take you to the monongahela river and the bike trail along side that.\u000athere are extensive hiking trails throughout the park's steep valleys and wooded slopes.   i love to bike and there are several good bike trails throughout the park.  one word of caution--you must stick to the bike trails.  not only is going off the trails unsafe, you could harm the ecological balance of the park by creating a new trail and adherence to the policy is strictly enforced.   \u000a\u000awhat i really love about frick park is that it is practically the woods in the city.  not only are the trails through woodlands, but horticulture and botany seem to be the main focus here.   the park district has started a program to remove invasive trees and species from frick park.  per the website, over the past 3 years, 325 norway maples and 600 trees of heaven have been removed, allowing the out-competed natives in the understory to thrive. \u000a\u000athis is truely a wonderous place to visit, any time of the year.  my favorite time is autumn.  i love to hike or bike in the cool crisp air with the palatte of colors surrounding me.  it is a place to come into and slow down for awhile.  appreciate the nature.  and do me and yourself a favor.  shut your !@# cel phone off when you come in here!  be in the moment here.  allow yourself to become immersed here!  i understand that, according to park rules, yakking on your cel phone is punishable by being taken down the the monongahela and keel-hauled!

Vmy cousin cindy and i both had the day off today and as we decided to get some fitness in, we decided to hike in frick park.  it was one of those truly glorious beautiful days in which we both felt that it was great to be alive.  \u000a\u000afor the uninitiated, frick park has an extensive trail system.  and these ain't no quarter mile long sidewalks either!  hiking in this park, it's easy to forget you're right in the middle of the city.  there are a few difficult trails and you can hike for several miles without ever leaving the park.  \u000a\u000ai met up with my cindy at the gatehouse at reynolds street--the sound of her approaching harley signalling her arrival.  we set off on an easy trail first and hit the tranquil trail, a little over a mile in length, down to the biddle trail.  from there we looped via the north loop, the clayton, and the south loop trails.  we picked up the tranquil trail again and decided to kick it up a notch by taking the more difficult trails, the falls ravine trail and the riverview trail which was more than a 2-mile long loop.  \u000a\u000awe rounded out our hike by taking the braddock trail, the homewood trail, and hawthorne trail back via the tennis courts and the bowling green.  i'd have to say all-in-all we hiked about 6.2 miles today!  not bad for the first hike of spring!

Vwhat could be more invigorating than a brisk hike on a crisp, cool october morning?  as much as i love summer, my favorite time of the year to go hiking or biking is in the fall.  you've got the colors, the smells, the snap to the morning air, etc.  my girlfriends lisa, maryann, marla, sherry, and i had a girls morning out in the park.  \u000a\u000ait was a cool 42f as we met at the reynolds street gatehouse located at the corner of reynolds street and homewood avenue.  the gatehouse has  something in common with the jefferson memorial.  they were both designed by the famed architect john russell.  we began our hike by taking the tranquil trail down approximately 3/4 mile to the north clayton loop.  this is a great way to begin as it's an easy trail.  we went past the frick environmental center, pausing to take a look at observation deck.  we then did a mini loop on the nature trail before rejoining our route.\u000a\u000awe then looped on the bench trail over towards the basketball courts, and then picking up iron gate trail.  here's where we kicked it in a notch.  the trails go from easy to moderate here.  we took the iron gate trail down to the nine mile run trail.  when completed, the nine mile run trail will go all the way down to the monongahela river, connecting to the bike trail there.  can't wait!\u000a\u000awe headed up the nine mile run trail past the soccer field and did a 1.2 mile loop on the babcock trail returning to nine mile run.  making a left on the falls ravine trail, we saved the best for nearly last.  we did a rigorous two-mile walk on the lower riverview trail and the riverview trail.  this is where the ol' blood gets circulating!  (i also had to take a snack break here--i'm a type-1 diabetic and i felt myself getting a bit low).  well we returned on the falls ravine trail back to the tranquil trail and headed up towards the gate house again. \u000a\u000ai'd say we did close to seven miles hiking in frick park.  it's an amazing place and it's hard to believe it's right in an urban area.  now what better way to top off an invigorating hike on a crisp fall morning than with a good bowl of soup?

Vfrick park!  is there anything else i can say differently from the four previous reviews i have written?  except to say that it's my favorite place to go hiking.  frick park is comprised of 561 acres, most of it woodland, and an additional  106 acres were annexed to the park as part of  the summerset at frick park housing development and restored the nine mile run stream valley. now frick park stretches from its northern borders in point breeze down to the monongahela river.  it's got possibly the most extensive trail system of any city park anywhere and it's trails run the gamut from wimpy to rugged.  \u000a\u000ai had originally intended to go hiking here with my girlfriends however i organized the hike as part of my employer's wellness program.  we ended up having a decent turnout.  as usual, we met at the gatehouse at reynolds street.  not only is this an easy landmark to find with ample street parking, but by beginning at the far north end of the park, we were able to get a lot in.  so we began on the homewood trail, past the bowling green.  frick park, incidentally, is one of the few parks left with lawn bowling.  now this is an easy trail which skirts the upper edge of a ravine.  \u000a\u000awe took that down to the junction with the tranquil trail, eventually ducking under forbes avenue which crosses the park on a high bridge.  we proceeded south until we linked up with the braddock trail.  here susan, your hike leader, decided to throw a changeup into the plans.  the braddock trail skirts the western perimeter of the park but to reach the edge, there's a climb up about 3-4 flights of stairs!  so we passed the clay tennis courts and again headed south.  we could see the tranquil trail in the ravine beneath us.  we took the stairs back down, again rejoining that trail at the falls ravine shelter.  we took a little break here before proceeding south.  \u000a\u000aat this point the nine mile run trail begins, so named for the watershed and the  creek it follows.  the nine mile run watershed has been undergoing a conservation effort http://www.yelp.com/biz/nine-mile-run-watershed-pittsburgh .  the trail passes some parking lots and a soccer field, eventually ending up at commercial street.  this was the southern boundary of frick park until a few years ago when 106 acres were annexed.  we crossed commercial street then went under i-376 (parkway east), which also crosses on a high bridge.  this is a spot where you really get to see pittsburgh's topography.  you can stand well beneath the highway, which just to the west passes through squirrel hill tunnel.  and if you look to the west, you'll see an apartment building well above the highway.\u000a\u000anine mile run trail picks up on the other side of commercial street, but it's not well marked.  we walked down it a little bit but really there isn't a lot to see.  google maps shows the trail going all the way down to the monongahela river and connecting with the duck hollow trail.  the official frick park map shows it dead-ending so we turned around and headed north on the firelane trail.  here some of the "less advanced" hikers decided to return back via the nine mile run and tranquil trails (the easy way).  heh, heh--not susan and the hardcore hikers.\u000a\u000ano, we picked up the firelane extension trail, which begins a very steep climb out of the falls ravine.  hiking the  firelane extension trail is like climbing a 1/4-mile long flight of stairs!  then we proceeded on the lower ravine trail which also has some steep ups and downs.  the trails in here are very rugged and very narrow.  heck, you could probably use a walking stick in thru here.  not only that, but this is a very isolated part of the park.  i don't recommend hiking alone in through here because if something was to happen to you, it's possible no one would find you.  so we came up to the junction of the lower riverview and thre falls ravine trails and we pressed on up to the frick environmental center.  now on a flat map it looks like it's a 1/4 mile walk, but there's still some serious ups and downs!  \u000a\u000aafter a serious rest and snack break at the enviromental center, we returned to the falls ravine trail and then back up the tranquil trail.  when we returned to the gatehouse, we knew those who stayed off the more challenging parts of frick park were long gone.  oh, but our heartrates were going and it felt good completing almost seven miles of hiking, much of it on hilly terrain.

Vdoesn't matter how many times i visit this place, it's never the same.\u000a\u000africk park is an amazing park and probably the best in the city to visit with how far it stretches.  most of my visits consist of me taking the little man to the off the leash area.  two great areas for a dog to interact with other dogs.  if you feel one area is too crowded for your four-legged friend, try the next area.\u000a\u000athe trails are quite extensive too.  i've walked through several different areas throughout the part and i for one know i have not seen all of the park yet.  i use to live in an apartment building in squirrel hill right off of one of the trails for frick park and found it convenient to be able to access just about anywhere in the park from my back door.  \u000a\u000ai'm sure i could live in this city my whole life and probably not be able to cover all there is to do in this park.  each neighborhood that connects to this park seems to have something you can with the park.  squirrel hill has got the baseball fields and playground at the entrance on beechwood.  regent square has got their own ball fields and playground as well as tennis courts to use at their entrance.  i'm sure there is more to do, i just haven't discovered it yet.

Vwanted a place where i could sit and get work done..\u000acaribou looked really cozy from outside and the ambiance was really nice.\u000ai wanted something new and different, and so asked for an 'apple blast'.. it was terrible.. i don't blame the place.. the people who order things like that on a regular basis probably do like this warm, sweetish drink.. next time i will stick to my hot chocolate.\u000aall the tables were filled with people who seemed to be studying or discussing work.\u000aoverall, this place looks like an awesome place to spend a couple of hours finishing assignments or studying for an exam.

Vi hate those little bits of candy bars that sink to the bottom of the cup! i have to throw half the cup away because the texture of the crumbs mixed with my latte makes me want to gag. i've attepted to order it without candy on top, but they put them on anyway.

Voh god how i hate the coffee here.  yet everyone insists on meeting up at caribou!  blerg. \u000athe service is usually friendly but not super knowledgeable, and the prices are on par with starbucks. their breakfast sandwiches are not half bad for being microwaved or whatever. this oakland location stays pretty busy during the school year with undergrads typing and chatting away.

Vi visit this place every time i'm in vegas! a lot of people frown at the idea of paying $10 just to look at a whole bunch of cars that they can't afford but, c'mon, most of us go to our local yearly car shows. same difference. make sure to go down to the bottom level of the dealership. there are a lot more cars down there. and you can get your picture taken in a ferrari.\u000a\u000aat least if you take your ticket into the ferrari store they will take $10 off a purchase of $100 or more so it's basically free if your going to buy something in the store.\u000a\u000ai saw some great deals when i was there. hooded jackets that retail for $200 on sale for $60. key chains that retail for $150 for $25. cologne gift sets with 3.4 oz bottles of cologne and model ferrari's for $65 . \u000a\u000aexotic cars are like beautiful women, i could look at them all day without getting bored. if you love cars as much as i do i highly recommend it!

Vi was on a grease roll and didn't pretend to be healthy yesterday.\u000a\u000ai ordered the 3 pieces (i should order 2 next time!) with the dirty rice and a side of warm mouth watering (and melting) biscuit. the biscuit is so much better than something out of kfc but i am sure they used so much more butter! the chicken was crispy and the meat was so moist! the skin was not a thick load of batter like some fried chicken can get and the spice was just right. \u000a\u000atill next time, bojangles!

Vif you did not know any better, you would think that point state park (name notwithstanding) is a city park that is pittsburgh's front yard.  well, it is a wonderful park.  besides, how many other cities have a state park right in the heart of downtown?\u000a\u000apoint state park has been closed for awhile now for re-construction.  the good news is that the city side of the park is now open! this includes the city-side lawn, portal bridge, overlook area and access to the pedestrian walkway to the north shore. they have done a lot of  upgrades including a new lawn, new irrigation, drainage and electrical systems; pathways, landscaping, benches and lighting; vendor hookups; a new stage pad; and renovations to the reflecting pool.\u000a\u000alocated between the three rivers and the fort pitt and fort duquesne bridges, point state park is an urban oasis.  the actual point has a 150' fountain.   did you know that there is actually a 4th river at the point?  that's right!  an underground river feeds the fountain, which is actually an aerator.  i love to come here on my lunch hour sometimes, even though it's a bit of a hike, and de-stress.  it's wonderful to read a book here, or sit and watch the highway, river, and rail traffic go by.  the only other city i know of with a "front yard" is chicago with its grant park.

Vthis is a great distraction from the hustle and bustle of city life.  also it is just enough of wilderness to indulge in, but close enough to get back to your life if you need to run back to it.\u000a\u000ait's awesome to be able to just sit along the waterfront and read a book, or even just to stare off into space as the hours run away from you.  there are a ton of things you can do when you are down here.  go to a museum, check out the block house, run the trails, ride a bike, eat at a cafe, lay on the lawn in the sun...the possibilities are endless here.  and with the fountain's renovation complete, who could resist being hit by that mist as you bask in the sun?\u000a\u000aevery time i am in the downtown area, i attempt to make it over here, even if it is to stand at the underpass and throw coins in the pond.  it's quite relaxing and this park has some of the best views of the city.\u000a\u000ahow appropriate is it that i start out my yelp challenge with one of pittsburgh's outdoor venue (zoo) and end it with another outdoor venue, and one as amazing as this place.

Vgood luck finding authentic mexican food in pittsburgh!\u000a\u000achipotle hits the spot with it's consistent taste and quality. the wait is never too long during rush hour lunch, barbacoa is yummy and i'll never complain about too much rice. it is hard to find parking near by which can add 20 mins to your lunch, easily. and i don't think this chipotle carries any beer.

Vsadly this is the best burrito you can get in pittsburgh (atleast in proximity to cmu).\u000astandard chipotle really.. everything gets tastier when its made in front of you.. thats what i think makes all chipotle's so awesome.

Vi'm giving this chipotle my elusive five-star rating today because time from the back of an out-the-door line to burrito counter was ~2 minutes.  mad props.\u000a\u000aveggie burrito bowl...always delicious.  they are not stingy with the guacamole at this joint.

Vever since bruester's over on beechwood boulevard closed, my husband rick and i have been looking for a good place to get cool treats on a summer's eve.  bruester's was great 'cos we could get a nice long walk in before and after eating yummy caloricious and carbalicious goodies.  besides, sometimes a gal needs a nice long evening stroll with her hubby.\u000a\u000awell unfortunately for us, we haven't found a new place to get that nice stroll in, but we did find a good spot right around the corner from us.  rita's has been here awhile now, but we just hadn't gotten around to coming here.  rita's is best known for their italian ice.  now i know that most italian ices are fruit flavored, so i decided to try something a little different.  their vanilla italian ice is s-o-o-o yummy!  but as anyone who knows me can tell you, i have unusual tastes.\u000a\u000athey also have "cream ice" here.  now what exactly differentiates "cream ice" from "ice cream", i don't know.  some of their other concoctions here include mistos (a blend of italian ice and frozen custard), gelati (italian ice and soft-serve custard), rittacino (a cappucino blend of coffe, italian ice and soft-serve custard), and more!  \u000a\u000ai'm definitely coming back here to try all of these.  which means of course i'm gonna have to hit curves and the bike trails more often too!  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!

Va group of my new classmates and i completely took up all the space in this little cafe, they seat maybe 15-20 people tops. i got a falafel, it was huge but the falafels were cold :( other than that it  was great, and you can't beat the price. with a bottle of soda, my total came up to something like $7.\u000a\u000ai also love their myspace website - they list the hours, menu with prices and etc. all extremely useful.

Vfalafels are very good, there's a lot of veggie in a thin style pita but that's how it should be. the only thing that surprised me were the spiced fries, which have standard curly fry seasoning on them, not za'atar or something like that. still pretty good.

Vthe beer is cheap.  the bartender is great.  the food is unique.  the music is stellar.  this is easily one of the best bars you'll find.\u000a\u000atuesday night had singer/songwriters cheering each other on, no cover, $2.20 bottles (including abita turbo dog), and $1 straub drafts.  had a red platter, which is kluski, halupki, kielbasa, and pierogie, golubki, all of which i've butchered the spelling of.  \u000a\u000awednesday night has the best drum 'n bass for any night of the week for maybe two hundred miles around.  gets busy around 10 pm.  $3ish cover, which used to include free wings, and may still include it.\u000a\u000athursday night, no idea what was going on musically, but tuesday's bottles were only $1.\u000a\u000athere's a heated outdoor smoking area; the indoor area of the bar is smoke free ish, and the outdoor area is about ten feet away.  everyone kind of wins.

Vreally excellent polish food.   everything is homemade and delicious.  the portions are generous.  there is a weekday special, 1/2 off pierogies from 5pm-7pm.  the decor is nothing fancy, but this place is certainly unique.  there are bands that perform later on weekends and an open mic night on tuesday, check the schedule. the outdoor seating is nice.

Vcame here at 9pm on a saturday night, ordered the tasting menu. we had a nut/seed allergy that we made them aware of and the first course and the bread both had seeds on them, but once we alerted them to the mistake they took the food back and gave us new food and gave us a different onion bread(which was refilled as fast as we ate it) and never made another mistake. the sommelier was knowledgeable and suggested a great wine, but never came by again to check on it. the food was expertly prepared, creative, and very filling - by the 5th course neither of us could finish the entire plate. the entire experience took just over 4 hours, so don't come here on a tight schedule. a special occasion, but worth it, at $300+tip with a bottle of wine

Vreally dug the atmosphere, the drinks were priced decently and the music was great. everyone was friendly and the sound was decent. it was not crowded with a small act and on night before the canadian thanksgiving, but everyone was very into the music, having the best per-capita audience participation for an opening act in any venue i've ever seen.

Vfun menu and good food, it was nice for a quick breakfast. i got a crepeomlete(eggs, spinach, and cheddar wrapped in a crepe and covered in hollandaise) and it tasted good. the service was prompt but the waitress seemed a bit reluctant to speak english to us. the presentation was very neat though, the towers of cut fruit looked incredible! for a local-seeming chain it is definitely a good choice

Vthe food here is substantial and delicious. this tied with au pied de cochon for favorite restaurant in montreal.\u000a\u000amekong was delicious, satay sauce and normal fillings.\u000a\u000athe lox spread is out of this world. amazing. exactly like real lox. magic from dulse and carrot pulp.\u000a\u000athe multi-spread appetizer is a great intro to the food here.\u000a\u000ablt is also amazing. the coconut is smoked/salted just right to swap for bacon. maybe too much lettuce and not enough mayo for me, but very good.\u000a\u000asouvlaki is good. burgers are amazing and meaty.

Vstreet parking seems very doable in this neighborhood, but pay close attention to the signs. \u000a\u000alundi is monday; mar is tuesday; jeudi is thursday; vendredi is friday. don't get a ticket. there is a parking lot available but we never needed it. the croissants aren't great, but the coffee is nice.\u000a\u000arooms all start with a 1. 13x is the 3rd floor. 11x is the 1st floor. there are no elevators, so try to get a 11x room if you're travelling with heavy or unwieldy luggage. try to get a 13x room if you want to have less noise\u000a\u000ai've stayed in budget hotels in almost every state in the us and this is easily the best hotel i've stayed in at this cost. the hotel is incredibly convenient to berri-uqam metro stop and less than 2 miles from most of the tourist attractions i went to. everyone on staff is friendly and accommodating. there is always someone at the desk, there is a separate key for front door and your bedroom. the toilets work powerfully, even after a diet of poutine and au pied de cochon.\u000a\u000amy room was spacious, well ventilated and the internet was fast and easy to access. everything was clean and tidy. there was more than enough storage for a week or two's worth of clothing. we had a minifridge. my mattress was very firm and not the most comfortable, but again, i chose where to spend my money. what else do you want at these prices?

Vthe opus was in an excellent location right in the heart of montreal. the decor was modern - looking like an urban loft with large simple pieces of furniture maximizing the openness of the room, although the painting in the room was a bit too colorful for the rest of the decor. the bathroom was excellent with a large shower and great lighting. the hotel staff was very nice, exchanging some currency for me every day(dollar-for-dollar, which was a better rate than the bank gave at the time). we were also able to catch some of the common-area wifi from our second floor room, which was great. koko and suco, the bars at the hotel, were busy every night, full of house and hip hop music and trashy dancing, if that is your thing. koko even gave me a smoking screwdriver which was a great touch. all you had to do was flash your hotel key to get into either. while neither were my scene, i do admit that the dj at suco was definitely putting in the work and gave an impressive mix all the way to the end of the night, with a heavy emphasis on reading the crowd. koko was definitely less inspired. musically, but it was less crowded and an easier crowd. the area can remain loud at night with many emergency vehicle sirens and car horns when it gets late, also you can pretty easily hear the music bumping in the hallways, but if you don't mind then it's a great stay. we got a great rate on jetsetter and if we can get it again we'd be excited to go again.

Vhad a good time. their air filtration makes some loud drone-y noises, and their dj lays down really simple relaxed beats. i really enjoyed them together. waitress let us play with the light system briefly.\u000a\u000aconfusing but welcome scotch pricing, lagavulin 16 was cheaper than the 12. they had no problem with us bringing in our own cigars. lots of comfortable seating. \u000a\u000athere's a slightly inconvenient bathroom near a bar, and at a certain point in the evening they check your coats for you but don't want them on tables or chairs.

Vi was a little disappointed in green onion.  i went in for the first time to try to get some lemon grass for a soup i was making, but when i got there i realized i didn't know what lemon grass looked like.  that would have been ok, except that all the produce was either unlabeled or not labeled in english, and also shrink wrapped (preventing me from smelling any of it to help me figure out what it was.)  i ended up guessing ("what looks the most like grass?") and when i got out to my car and ripped the shrink wrap off to smell my purchase immediately discerned that i had bok choi and not lemon grass.  i hate bok choi!!  \u000a\u000athey did have a better selection of rice wine (sake and korean varieties) than anywhere else in town, and about 20 kinds of mochi (i love mochi!)  i'm sure it's really hard to get actual asian produce to champaign, so i guess in retrospect i shouldn't be surprised that most of their inventory was varieties of asian noodles and dry grains.  \u000a\u000ai can see why, if i were an asian student, i would like to come to green onion to get my brand of noodle bowl that i can't get anywhere else.  however, as the gringo aspiring chef that i am, i am sad to report that this isn't the place for me to get the sauces and spices i need for my asian cooking as i hoped it would be. on the bright side, my trip did make me realize that schnuck's actually has an acceptable variety of the ingredients that i usually need (e.g., fish sauce, vegetable oil, chili sauce.)

Vthis is easily the most anticipated restaurant to open in pittsburgh that i can recall.  richard chen is the chef/owner of wing lei located at the fantastically over the top wynn in las vegas. wing lei is the only michelin star rated asian themed restaurant in all of north america and is clearly regarded as one of the best asian restaurant in this country.  this fact makes it all the more noteable that he's chosen to open his second venture in pittsurgh, and not only pittsburgh, but s'liberty (the economically challenged east liberty section of pittsburgh).  it opened a couple of weeks ago and clearly has benefited from the hype, having very long waits and difficult key reservation times.  a friend and i naively thought we'd take a shot at trying to get in  friday night.  we stopped in at 730 pm and were told that the earliest table for two wouldn't be until 900 pm.  this was not a big surprise, so we walked across the street to sample some wine in the newly renovated red room.  we stopped back a little before 900 pm and were told we still had a small wait, so we thought we would have another drink at the unusually small bar.  i really am surprised or i guess i should say disappointed that the bar area only has about 5 seats and the restaurant overall doesn't have much room for anyone waiting for a table, nevertheles we were able to get a seat.at the bar.  i'm a little embarrassed to admit, but i ordered an espressotini, which was really really good.  after a few minutes we were sat towards the back in a perfectly acceptable table.  the space itself is relatively small with seating for i'd guess about 80-100.  the tables are somewhat close together and the owner definitely prefers a minimilist approach to his restaurant.  the ceilings are extremely high with beautiful huge paper decorations.  i found the service to be quite good given the fact this place just opened.  we had multiple servers which were all attentive and friendly.  the menu is pretty large serving some of the more en vogue meat items such as kurobuta pork and kobe beef.  we started with pot stickers and some type of poached lobster appetizer.  i found the pot stickers to be average.  they were relatively small and underseasoned. i wasn't pleased either with the poached lobster, which was tasteless and served with a very bland sauce.  on my next visit i really want to try some of his soups or other dishes served in a pot.  others around us were sampling these and the fragrance was awesome.  we ordered some fried rice to go with our entrees.  the fried rice was great, seasoned well and very fresh tasting.  i tried the kurobuta pork, which is to pork what kobe is to beef.  it was amazing!  a vey nice pork chop perfectly seasoned well marbled and a sweet sauce.  one of the best pork chops if not the best i've ever had.  my friend ordered the kung pao chicken, which i think she said was the best she's ever tried.  i sampled and was really impressed with the flavor.  again, there is a freshness with these dishes and a crispness to the flavor that i am unfortunately unfamiliar with in many asian dishes.  we skipped the desserts, however he had some interesting options.  the executive chef, i think alex is his name came out to ask about our meal.  it was a really nice touch and the chef seemed genuinely interested in our feedback.  he's actually a british guy ( i think alex is his name), who for whatever reason chose verona/oakmont ( a small suburb where i'm from to settle in for his time in pittsburgh).  i thought it was cool to have an asian restaurant in pittsburgh being captained by a guy from the british empire.  i asked about chef chen who was there that night.  he said he'll split his time between vegas and pittsburgh.  i have no doubt this place will deserve four or five stars once they've had a chance to work out some of the kinks on the current menu or if i do a better job of picking my items.  i didn't think the prices were too outrageous, definitely much less than i payed at wing lei.  the food/menu currently isn't near as good or as interesting as wing lei, but with chef chen spending half his time here i'm sure this place will also start to receive some of the national acclaim its sister restaurant currently enjoys.  i really hope he expands the bar.  it is clearly not meant as a bar where people can eat and that's a shame for the single businessman who enjoys good food.

Vthe food here was good, and the service was good.  the atmosphere is also nice.  i don't know why i'm giving such low marks, given that if this had been anywhere else (meaning, less hyped up), it would have gotten 4 stars.  i think the part that brings this place down is the unwarranted association between chinese food and cheap food.  somehow, you think that chinese food is typically cheap, so you are aghast at the prices that richard chen's charge.\u000a\u000aallow me to say that this association is unwarranted here.  the quality of the ingredients used is as high or higher than the other expensive restaurants in pittsburgh.  for example, we had the sea bass clay pot, and the sea bass was legitimately chilean sea bass, which is quite expensive.  the beef for the mongolian beef dish was also very high quality.  so even though the dishes are not a radical departure from traditional chinese food, the ingredients most certainly are of higher quality.\u000a\u000athat being said, i don't think that simply putting more expensive ingredients into a chinese dish automatically raises the inventiveness of the dish.  and that is probably what disappoints me the most about this place.

Vdelicious! this was definitely up there with the best meals i've ever eaten - excellent in every way imaginable.  i especially enjoyed the scallops and the hazelnut ice cream.  even though this is an expensive restaurant, the quality measures up so it won't feel like a waste of money.

Vfor the best simple, cheap, and delicious meal you could get around the south side works, go to the pita pit. \u000a\u000ai know, i know, this is a bold statement for the area that's home to the cheesecake factory and other pretty decent restaurants. but, sometimes you find yourself around the south side works area walking around and shopping and all you want is to satisfy a hunger. you don't really want a fancy shmancy meal; you especially don't want to drop one or two jacksons on dinner. you also don't want to waste good shopping time on eating. you look around the area and your pickins are slim. \u000a\u000atrust me, head over to the pita pit. for those of you who don't know what it is - basically, it's subway on pitas. you choose your sandwich and then you go to the condiments area and choose your toppings galore. it's got a way better selection than subway! and, i actually really like their veggie options like hummus and falafel (beats the one selection of veggie delight)\u000a\u000aeven if you do stumble in here because of my "quick, easy, and cheap" recommendation, i assure you the next time you'll go into the pita pit just because it was so good the first time around.

Vi couldn't help giving pita pit 5 stars - it's amazing. fast & cheap, who knew you could fit so much into a pita? those guys really know how to roll 'em. i love the falafel pita with hummus, sprouts, cucumbers, olives, spinach, tomatoes and tzatziki. \u000a\u000athe best part is, you never come out smelling like bread and cold cuts (like other chains that shall remain nameless)

Vafter a summer full of delicious shawarma wraps every week, i felt like i needed to find a place in pittsburgh to help me with my cravings.\u000a\u000ai got a lamb shawarma wrap.  and i also devoured it in less than 5 minutes.  i like my shawarma wraps to be of the spicy variety, but it was definitely tasty at taza 21.\u000a\u000avegetarian wraps go for 6 bucks while non-vegetarian ones are 7.  they also have salads and what not, but i doubt i'd get a salad when their wraps are so tasty.\u000a\u000amy buddy said their kibbee wrap was pretty good too.  i'll have to try it out next time.  i also want to hit up their hummus.  good hummus is so hard to find.

Vafter walking up and down murray twice, in december cold nonetheless, i finally made up my mind and we went to taza. having always noticed it when driving by i was curious to see what kind of food they served or if they served food at all.\u000a\u000aturns out it's a tiny mediterranean cafe that serves a variety of wraps, salads and pita pizzas including a mouth-watering lamb shawarma wrap! it's definitely a great lunch spot for something quick and relatively healthy, the inside is a little dark but cozy and they also do catering.

Vthis review is a 3.5 being rounded up because of the delightful owner, she is the sweetest thing and so happy to describe taza's offerings for you. my falafel was tasty and packed with flavor, the patties were lightly fried so they were on the softer side which i liked very much. jb got a lamb shawarma and it undoubtedly got his seal of approval. our wraps cost 7 and 9 respectively, they were a bit on the small side which would make for a satisfying lunch but definately not enough to fill our bellies for dinner.

Vi was in the mood for something different today, something other than subway. taza 21 seemed to be an appropriate choice. i ordered the meat (beef and lamb) shawarma. it was warm, savory and i was sad after i had finished eating it because it was so delicious. the service wasn't bad and i didn't have to wait long for my food either. the prices at taza 21 are pretty cheap, so i will definetly be back to try other items on the menu.

Vi affectionately call this place "the white trash bar."  dive is quite accurate.\u000a\u000adrinks are super cheap.  depending on the crowd, service can take a while.  also if you don't mind having a sock wearing dancer dancing above you, you might be fine, just be sure to cover your drink...don't need anyting 'extra' dropping in there.  \u000a\u000adownstairs is just a simple dive bar with a jukebox.  good for relaxing.  upstairs is somewhat of a dance club setting.  the dance floor however seems like it is a springboard that could fall apart at any moment.  avoid the bathrooms downstairs, use the ones upstairs, a tad more room.  careful on the steps as well, i've seen a few people take a tumble down them (yes, i laughed at them).\u000a\u000anever paid a cover here.  cash only, atm located inside.  avoid the food sitting out.  go the right night you may get a glimpse of the owner and her dog (yes, her dog comes in every so often).

Vwe got some takeout from here last week, since it's just down the block.  we ordered from campusfood, and then put in the comments section "we have a 20% off coupon!" which was on pacific ring's website.  this was, in retrospect, kind of stupid of us - within 15 minutes we got a call from the restaurant saying that they can't honor coupons when you order from campusfood.  apparently campusfood charges pacific ring 10% of every order total - the price they pay for using the service, i suppose.  anyway, since they're already paying 10% to campusfood, they don't honor coupons on top of that.  if you want to use coupons - order direct from the restaurant.  that made sense, and i apologized - the lady said she'd still give us 10% off anyway though, which was nice of her!\u000a\u000athe food was ready when they said it would be, and we came back home with our chicken fried rice and singapore-style rice noodles.  i was immediately jealous of my boyfriend's chicken fried rice, and immediately asked "we're sharing, right??" before taking a huge heapful of it onto my plate.  i love chicken fried rice so darn much.  pacific ring does a nice job of it, and by that it means it is exactly what you'd expect - the same fried rice you can get anywhere.  which means it's really tasty.  because fried rice is awesome.  no new twist.  just yumminess.  i was somewhat underwhelmed by my noodle dish.  it wasn't very seasoned - just noodles with some chicken and shrimp with a vague hint of curry flavor.  there wasn't really a sauce to the dish - seemed more like they'd sprinkled curry powder on the noodles.  tasted fine, i guess, but not as good as i'd hoped.\u000a\u000awe'd order again - it's convenient and pretty standard stuff. just what you'd expect from chinese takeout.

Vthis was a pleasant surprise on an all too common sunday afternoon.  this was the third choice on the list of lunch spots for sunday.  we first thought we would try amalfi on 5th (old bruschettas at holiday inn), but they were closed...odd, for a hotel bar, then we drove by 17th st. grille and found them to be closed as well.  we are drawn into folino's initially by the outdoor seating and crowd.  i've been by this place multiple times and had planned to check it out for a while especially after i had heard that sienna miller (of sh*tsburgh fame) was denied entry.  so, we end up at folino's... too hot to sit outside annie and i walk in pass a big bar and friendly tatooed gal bartender to duck into the dining room on the right, get a good table in the back.  i'm not sure how to describe the atmosphere, but i really liked it.  there were real paintings on the walls.  the colors of the wall were very loud, plus there were a few plasmas and everyone seemed to have a smile on their face.  len joins us minutes later.  the menu is pretty big, i guess it should be mentioned that this family also owns tom's diner or vice versa and you have full access to the toms' diner menu as well as a few more upscale options.  the gal waiting on us is pretty good, your typical yinzer (in a good way).  she steers annie away from some dish and seems to have an opinion on most things we ask.  i never order liver and onions, so when i do i want to make sure they are up to par.  i ask the gal about these and from the expression on her face i can tell she's not a fan.  now, as an aside i think i actually will try them because i'm thinking this has more to do with her disdain for this delicacy than the relative goodness of this liver and onions compared to another.  i settle on a gyro... it's fine, just like any other gyro i've ever ordered for the most part.  len settles on the peach salad with some chicken.  he says it's good.  it sounds good if only i liked salads.  annie has the chicken romano.  i'm typically not a fan of this dish, however having sampled this one i may need to re-evaluate my feelings.  it's moist and lightly coated with the egg.  i'm a bit surprised at how much i like it and think i'll have to try again.  i intend to back to this joint if for nothing more than to enjoy the al fresco dining, people watching, live music and to try those darn liver and onions...

Vdavio--the cuisine of the sun!\u000a\u000ai met a friend here after work last night.  she was driving from washington, dc to chicago and decided to stay overnight in pittsburgh.  she loves italian food and another friend of mine recommended davio to me.\u000a\u000athis place is fantastic!  davio specializes actually in mediterranean cuisine.  we started our dinner with an appetizer of buffalo milk mozzarella with tomatoes, fresh basil, and  olive oil.  now i never tried buffalo milk cheese before, but it was delicious.  for my salad, i had the roma tomatoes,  olive oil, sea salt, and basil.  i might add that davio makes its own dressings.\u000a\u000adespite the high-carb count and that i live by my insulin, i love pasta and this place has some of the best  home-made stuff around.  i opted for the ravioli alla picchi-pacchi with tomatoes,  garlic, olive oil  basil leaves.  methinks i overloaded on the olive oil and basil!\u000a\u000amy friend and i walked out of there so satisfied with our meals that i was perfectly willing to schlep home two meals worth of leftovers on the bus and the "t".  i'm sure she will leave a review too, so i'll let her describe her dinner on her own.

Vm-m-m-m, davio!  \u000a\u000ai decided to do something sweet for my husband and, borrowing an idea from a friend of mine, take him out on a date.  i dolled myself up after work and had him meet me at the wood street "t" station.  i didn't tell him where we were going.\u000a\u000adavio is one of those hidden, hole-in-the-wall gems that are oh so worth checking out.  it's one of those places existing solely on word-of-mouth advertising.  but it's been a neighborhood fixture for over 20 years.  if you're passing by on the "t", blink and you miss it.  \u000a\u000awe got off the "t" at boustead street and rick wondered where the h-e-double-hockey-sticks i was taking him.  beechview is a very nice residential neighborhood but it's not exactly known for its fine dining and nightlife.  he was amazed at this little place.  even more amazed that it actually exists.  i told him to enjoy himself and order whatever he wanted, the evening was on me.  (yeah i know.  we have joint credit cards & bank accounts!  so sue me!).  \u000a\u000adavio gives you a choice of how you want to order.  you can have the prix-fixe complete dinner, or you can order ala- carte.  rick opted for the prix-fixe and you know, it ain't a bad deal.  for $32.00 you get your bread with fagiolini and gorgonzola spreads course, your chef's pasta of the day, your main course with chef's choice of vegetable, your biscotti, and coffee or tea.  rick opted for the filet mignon as his main course.\u000a\u000aas for me, i wanted pasta.  i'm a type-1 diabetic and i wanted to give my insulin a workout!   really though, their pasta here is just s-o-o-o wonderful.  my linguine al pescatore (linguine with  shellfish feast of lobster tail, shrimp, and scallops) was simply divine.  i thought about trying something different for my antipasta, but the buffalo milk mozzarella is just too good to pass up.\u000a\u000ai don't believe they serve alcohol here, but they might allow byob and they might have a corkage fee.  i'm a non-drinker so i don't pay attention to that sort of thing.  call them before you do the ol' byo thing.  \u000a\u000arick and i had a wonderful meal at davio.  he loved that i took him out on a date and planned the whole evening.  um, too bad we had to ride the "t' and the bus home!

Vbless this rite-aid for being so close to work!  that's why it gets five-stars today!  seems that susan yesterday ate her cheeseburgers and fries way too fast yesterday after being out all day in the warm weather.  susan's tummy didn't like it one bit.  susan's tummy was still not a happy girl this morning!  susan didn't want to eat her breakfast this morning (not good because susan is a diabetic)!\u000a\u000aso susan had to sneak out of work for a few minutes and stop in here to get alka-seltzer.  susan hates the taste, but her tummy was so much better! \u000a\u000amost of these chain pharmacies are all the same, but there are times when you really need one.

Vokay, let's try this again.  i wrote this review on october 25, 2010 but mistakenly put it under the rite aid in squirrel hill.  yeah i know, most pharmacies are pretty generic looking and any review can fit any one of them but read on...\u000a\u000ai'm glad this rite aid has stayed open.  it's pretty close to work so whenever i need to pick up anything, it's pretty convenient.  i had to pick up my prescription this morning.  i take lipitor on occasion and they do have some diabetes supplies.  \u000a\u000ai just remembered that when i was a teen, this used to be the old gimbel's department store.  it sat vacant for many years then was redeveloped with burlington coat factory, barnes & noble, and thrift drug.  i remember thrift drug was pretty upscale before they were taken over by rite aid.  \u000a\u000a(now you know why i had to put my review in the correct location).

Vus airways code shares with united airlines, and that's how i ended up on them even though i booked thru united.  i've gotta love the creative routings both carriers sent me.  traveling from pittsburgh to kansas city, i had to connect in newark.  coming back i had to connect in charlotte.  hey, who doesn't love the whole going-east-to-get-west thing?  \u000a\u000aand another thing....wait!  us airways still exists?  and they still fly their own planes into pittsburgh?  i didn't know that!

V5801 is the go-to place for my coworkers and i to go for happy hour.  i've been here in all kinds of circumstances....straight from work at 5 pm (when we were basically the only people there), and also at 2 am on the crowded dance floor.  the music is great, the patio is expansive and comfortable, and the bartenders are really friendly.   their happy hour actually doesn't start until 6, but i like that because that gives me time to actually get there - usually when bars have happy hours that start at 5 pm, i've already missed half of it by the time i arrive.  they have a creative martini list and the bartenders are willing to make you surprise creations if you aren't sure what to order.  i've only had a little bit of food here - spinach/artichoke dip, hummus, sweet potato fries, buffalo chicken dip - all were perfectly tasty, a step above regular bar food quality.\u000a\u000aeveryone is comfortable and welcome here.  my boyfriend and i had a fantastic time dancing here late one night, and we love how they play music videos!  sometimes we'd just stop talking, drift off, and watch the videos.  i'll give it 5 stars just because it's been consistently great, service is super friendly, clientele is awesome (this is the kind of place where you make new "best friends" in 5 minutes), and it's good for both a chill drink and a crazy dance-off depending on when you show up.

Vi'm a fan of this place, who can't be with three separate bars to go to?  even if it is packed most weekends.  with the three separate bars it's like three separate atmospheres. \u000a\u000adownstairs is the kind of cool, kind of hip bright bar where if you want to get up close and personal with someone, you can.  the jukebox has an ample selection of tunes to choose from to tickle just about anyone's fancy.  on the colder days you can stand by the fireplace to warm yourself.  on the warmer days you can still stand by the fireplace, but don't worry, it's not on to roast the patrons.  it serves as a place to lean against and carry on a conversation with someone and be able to set your drink down if you like.  several high tables dot the area if you feel the need to sit as well as stools around the bar.  big windows allow you to view the people walking on the street as well as it lets them view you.\u000a\u000aupstairs is kind of the dim lit, low-key lounge bar.  electronic dartboards for play, some saturdays the dance floor can be in use if a dj is on premise.  nice big, somewhat circular bar in the middle with stools (they are in the middle of a remodel by the looks of it, to make it look even roomier).  booths and high tables are available for sitting as well.  a coat rack is there for you convenience to place you coat, but be careful, especially if you're wearing a coat that looks similar to others.  the music played upstairs when a dj is not around is that of the videos mentioned in this place's name.  it's like a dj is there with the videos playing.  dance and remix is all you hear, huge plus.  \u000a\u000athe deck, recently added onto, is a nice place to be able to go and take in the air.  tables are at an appropriate level outside, enough to seat people, but also the right about for people to mingle.  the newer portion of the deck reminds you of sitting in a small garden with lighted seating.  the deck is also used in cooler weather as well with their drop-down curtains to keep the elements out and they heaters to keep the temperature comfortable.  stools also line this bar as well.\u000a\u000acash or credit and you can always start a tab.  i believe tuesdays they now have a bingo event available as well as a dart league.  bartenders are always friendly and if you frequent enough remember your libation of choice.  one of the best bars to go to in shadyside whether you are gay or straight.

Vwith a nicely done remodel comes an updated review.  honestly, the main reason i am writing this is to say that i have come to love this place on one of it's 'off' nights.  don't get me wrong, i love being there on a busy night when it's crowded and you can hardly move, but i've come to embrace the off nights where there is hardly anyone there.  it has come to be my place to go when i just want to get a drink and chat.  that is what most *insert my day of choice here* have become (i truly don't want to say what day it is for fear that it may become crowded on that night).  \u000a\u000aand the remodel, can we talk about the remodel for a minute?  it's wonderful!  i'm so happy that they finally got rid of the doorway that divided the upstairs room, talk about bottle necking in a bar, now no more.  it also feels brighter upstairs and bigger.  could be that they got rid of some walls, maybe that had something to do with it.\u000a\u000ai cannot wait for warmer weather.  not because everyone is going to be out in shorts and sleeveless shirts, but because of the amazing remodel of the deck.  where the bar now resides, it feels like a ski lodge.  you walk in and you can smell the wood.  this little addition also adds more seating for people during hours they are open for food.  during the summer months looks as if they have the garage door openings to open the bar to the deck...away from the door openings to the deck, best part about the remodel i think.\u000a\u000aand for those that complain about the cigarette smoke, with all the complaining you keep doing i'm sure you'll have this as a smoke free place.  smoking is now restrained to the lower bar, away from the door.  no smoking in any other part of the building.

Vi remember be confused as to all hell when people use to tell me about the saloon.  this was back in my younger days when i didn't know any better that nightlife extended further down liberty than just to pegasus.  now that i'm older, not necessarily wiser, i have found the end of liberty that is livelier.\u000a\u000ai've been to the saloon on multiple occasions and found that it really is hit or miss, just like any other bar in the burgh area.  i seem to always go to the regular bar when it's karaoke night (not my cup of tea).  drinks aren't bad.  decor theme goes with the name of the place with barrel like tables set up in strategic locations where you have to dodge the fifty people on each side of it to get to the back where the bathroom is.\u000a\u000afor all the aspiring strippers out there, try your luck on the lighted platform complete with a pole.\u000a\u000aone of the best attributes to the saloon is the after-hours club located upstairs called tilden.  membership is a yearly basis fee of around $15.  you'll have access to the upstairs which has a bigger, better dance floor.  last time i was up there they were still in the middle of a remodel which made it a better place to navigate with the bar up against the wall instead of in the middle of the room.  downside, they got rid of the back bar.  worst night to go is probably sundays, not much going on there.

Vi was here last night and was relatively impressed with the beautiful space.  i didn't get a chance to sit in the dining room, but the bar area itself was pretty nice with plenty of seating and a better than average tequila selection.  they also had plenty of draft beer options . the area itself has high ceilings,nice lighting, beautiful ceiling fans, really dark wood, a couple of plasmas and plenty of leather.  the wine selection is decent and has plenty of options by the glass.  we ordered a few of the "small plates" while we sat at the bar.  however, you have the option to order off of the full menu, small plates menu, and bar menu.  i think it's a bit silly to have three different menus for your options while you sit at the bar.  it seems that if you can order anything off of any menu then their is no need for three different menus.  anyways, we started with the beef carpaccio, which was a bit above average served with parmigiano-reggiano, olive oil and roasted peppers.  the flavors melded pretty well together and the roasted peppers were nice albeit a bit oversoaked in olive oil.  the tuna tartare was okay.  i guess the tuna was of decent quality, but it was served a bit above room temperature which is a mistake. i think tartare should be served room temperature or a bit below.  i really liked the cured meats selection, which was served with a nice selection of olives and three different meats.  the prosciutto (sp?) was delicious and served room temperature which is correct.  we also had a few slices of a delicious salami and sopressata.  this is a good option for under $7.  in fact overall i found the prices to be quite reasonable.  finally, we ended with a trio of delicious lamb burgers.  this was my favorite from last night.  it was three perfectly cooked medium flavorful lamb burgers served with perfectly caramalized onions on warm, buttery soft bread with a sheeps milk blue cheese.  i really appreciated this cheese because it was a milder blue cheese and did not overpower the meat.  we stopped in the cigar bar after dinner and i was quite pleased with the space.  we sat on the comfy large leather couches and were served our martinis quickly.  overall this is a good place and i'm glad to see we have a decent cigar bar in pittsburgh.  i'll sample the full dinner menu the next time i visit.

Vservice: knowledgeable,engaged, attentive, helpful and personable. \u000a\u000aappetizer: we chose the calamari, which was cooked perfectly. we were surprised and delighted by the inclusion of preserved lemon. beautifully presented! ample portion for 2 to share. for a salad course we had greens and goat salad and a greens and beans special. both were very good.  for entrees, we had the pork chop and the ny strip steak. both were cooked exactly as we ordered. mushroom risotto was wonderful. we split the creme brle trio for dessert, a very non-traditional take, but very delicious and satisfying. again, the portion size was great for two.  our final bill was only $99, quite reasonable for the amazing diner. the chef, greg, came out to visit tables, which was also nice.

Vupdating my review after another fabulous dining experience.  we had the short rib appetizer that was a special, really quite extraordinary.  the goats and greens salad was scrumptious.  we ordered the scallops and ny strip and they were expertly cooked and delicious.  our waiter, tom, was extremely helpful with the wine list and with ordering the food.  he was also extremely attentive  but also left us alone to talk.  the chef came out to talk with us at around 9:30 pm.  he was proud of his food, but rightly so.  cioppino has extraordinary consistency and great food.

Vspak brothers recently opened on penn ave and brought a shining beacon of hope to the garfield/east lib/friendship area, serving up sexy slices in the flavors of omnivore, vegetarian, and even *vegan* pizza, hoagies, and wings. hell, i even travel there all the way from lower lawrenceville. \u000a\u000afirst of all, the decor is sparse - i mean, wicked sparse, with a pinball machine, a tabletop arcade machine, and a couple of stools lining the walls. if you require more than that to pick up pizza, you might be in the wrong place. lacking a tip jar, i heard that the pinball machine is the tip jar. stock up on credits for the staff before you leave. really, though, you should eat on the sidewalk outside with the rest of the bike punx, or take the pizza & wings to a friend's house for a pizza party! the service is friendly and swift. every time i have been there, the counter staff have all smiled, cracked jokes, and proved to be remarkably efficient at handling my special orders and inane lines of questions. there's a pretty good chance of a spak brother taking your order himself. that's charming. \u000a\u000athe menu itself is an inspiration and a delight in pittsburgh's pizza scene. homemade delicious seitan can be served up in the form of wings or delicious hoagies, in something like 4 flavors (3 of which are vegan). you can order pizzas with a variety of veggie meats - ask what they have in stock to avoid getting your heart broken. oh and you can order pizza with vegan cheese! like all vegan cheeses, it falls short of the real deal, but honestly, if you are a hungry vegan in need of a giant cheap pizza to get you through band practice - well, i've heard that spak is your lord & saviour. note: vegan cheese pizza is best consumed hot. the vegan cheese turns to some kind of alien form after it gets cold. tastes the same, weird mouthfeel, no fault of the spaks. \u000a\u000abe prepared to wait a few minutes for your food - the wait is reasonable, but they are actually cooking your food in their gigantic ovens, not just re-heating some frozen pizza back there. watch a spak toss some pizza dough. play some pinball. it's good for your soul. \u000a\u000a412-362-spak (7725)

Vi ordered buffalo seitan wings and fries at the counter for take-out.  my husband and i wanted to eat at the restaurant, but it's little more than a take-out counter and a few barstools against the wall.  oh, and a vintage addams family pinball machine that the husband was quite enamored with.\u000a\u000athe seitan wings are amazing.  i kept wondering if i was eating real meat--no really--did they mess up my order?  are these really vegan? i'm not eating meat, right? the fries were fresh, hand-cut, salty and delicious--not soggy like so many places in the 'burgh.\u000a\u000ai can't speak for the pizza here, but i would definitely stop by again for some more vegan buffalo deliciousness.

Vthis little shop is one of the best secrets in the southside neighborhood of pittsburgh. the collection of specially crafted clothing and accessories at the front tells a well-edited story of crafty, flirty, fun existence. some of their stuff is modern & hip, but there are stand-out classics on the racks, too. \u000a\u000athe hair salon in the back is an even bigger secret. i honestly don't know if they ever accept new clients without a recommendation or two, but if you can get in, it is worth it. creative and inspired, the cuts and dyes i have seen come out of that back room are mind boggling! do you want to look like a gorgeous, pulled-together hockey mom? no problem. would you rather have bleached white hair with hot pink and teal peacock designs dyed in? no problem. it feels like an intimate slumber party with girls you wish were your friends, but afterwards, your hair is "better-then-bedhead"-licious.

Vtasty, healthy sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups. they also serve breakfast although i've never tried it. in general, when i'm in the mood for something on the healthier side, this is near the top of my list in the oakland area. there are plenty of options available for vegetarians, but also for meat lovers. the restaurant is caf style in that you order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. seating gets a bit cramped around lunch hour, but that's just a sign of the quality.

Vred oak is one of the few places in oakland where it's possible to get healthy food. the wraps and salads are great, the food is locally sourced and organic, and the atmosphere inside is rather cool. it can get busy during the school year, but they're actually rather quick.

Vgreat lunch and breakfast spot.  salads, sandwiches and blue plate specials.  all organic, prepared with care and good sized portions.  oatys are great breakfast on the run on a cold day.  the grilled cheese is yum-tastic. they also have pre-prepared foods that you an grab and carry out.

Vi am a fan of red oak as it is one of the few healthier options in oakland. also, they are very veggie-friendly and i appreciate that even if their seitan isn't the best ever.  i think that everything i have ever had here has been good, but i haven't ever had anything great.\u000a\u000aservice can be a little dodgy--the last time i ate here, my two lunch companions finished their salads before mine was delivered even though we all ordered at the same time.  that being said, there is never a long wait even if it's crazy busy--which it often is.\u000a\u000amy favorites here are the sleek (kale/quinoa salad side dish) and any fresh juice from the juice bar. yum!  i'll keep coming back.

Vi decided to hold off on writing a review until i returned my weekend rental car at the clt airport thrifty. my car wasn't up to the normal rental cars i get from thrifty. yes, thrifty is a middle to lower end rental car company and can't compare with the nicer vehicles from hertz or avis, but for your every day rentals i like them a lot. this time, even i was a little disappointed. i got a white dodge avenger with over 30k miles on it, which is high for a rental, but that's not a big deal. i was renting this car for a 4 hours drive so while i was on the road, getting to my normal 79mph, i switch on the cruise control. crap, the cruise control was busted. i was annoyed. so annoyed. oh well, i would have to live with it. the passenger side vent was also broken, to add to the list of gimpy qualities on this vehicle.\u000a\u000ai was ready to write a 2 star review when i decided to wait for my final encounter. i typically don't complain about things that are wrong on a rental car because usually i'm running to the airport. because i returned at 7am, i had to go to the counter to get my receipt and close out the bill. so, since i was there anyway, i decided to tell them what was wrong with the vehicle just to let them know so they can service them if they so choose.\u000a\u000ato my surprise, the lady at the counter (gerry) actually gave me a decent discount off my bill. i didn't expect anything or even ask for it. i was just trying to inform them for their own purposes. this alone is enough for me to up my rating.\u000a\u000aall is forgiven when i get a nice savings! thanks, thrifty. you will remain my rental car company of choice.

Vthis is not a good restaurant.  it's a very good restaurant!  and, maybe will be the next great restaurant in pittsburgh.  i had dinner here this past week on a wednesday and had been planning on stopping by for a while.  it is located on baum blvd., where baum vivant used to be.  and, i can tell you the guys who opened this place up did a stellar job.  i had a reservation for 630 pm, but certainly could have dined without one on a weekday, however they say they're booking a month in advance for weekends.  the space itself is gorgeous and intimate.  you enter the front door and there is a nice wine bar to your left and a few leather chairs and couches for lounging across from the bar.  they also have a few tables on this first floor, but the main dining area is upstairs which i didn't enter.  it is warmly lit and the bar is very nice with a great display of wine bottles.  one of the owners paul used to be the wine director for eleven and i think the chef is also a big burrito alum'.  we never made it from the bar to our tables because we were enjoying speaking with others seated and the bartender, aaron.  the crowd is a mix of a few elderly gentry most likely from the big old houses around squirrel hill and shadyside.  there are also some twentysomethings in jeans with a hipster look to them and of course the early thirtysomething yuppies (and i mean yuppy in the most unflattering sense) like me.  we started with an assortment of appetizers.  the most expensive apps' option were the beets, yes beets.  they were delicious, oh yeah did i mention he serves them with large shavings of $3,000 / lb black truffles, divine!  also, had a perfectly seared scallop on top of grits.  now, i thought i had grits before, but it is clear after tasting this i've never had real grits, just the cream of wheat type.  these were delicious, savory with a hint of cheese and brown butter.  it was really good.  also, tried the short rib with white beans.  the beans were a little undercooked for me, but that's just my preferance.  the dish was a hit overall and reminded me of a french cassoulet.  the serving sizes overall by pittsburgh standards would be considered a tad small, but i think they work well for the price.  i tried a mushroom puree, which had great flavor, a hint of nutmeg and creme fraiche.  the flavor was great, but i would have preferred that the soup be strained one more time before serving.  it was a little too grainy for me.  finally, i had the chicken for dinner.  this was amazing!  instead of just a flavorless breast of chicken, he served this with some of the dark meat parts and then made a chicken confitt with part of the serving, chopping the meat into small tender pieces, sauteeing in its own fat and then putting back and wrapping the skin around.  it was really good.  the garlic mashed potatoes were as good as i've ever had also.  my friend had the flounder which i tasted and it was also quite good.  the entree costs were only $16 each.  i also found the wine to be very reasonably priced with bottles only at a 2-3 multiple, not the 4-5 you usually see.  they serve each glass with a very healthy pour and each glass gets its own decanter.  they also bake a fresh rosemary bread in house, which is good served with perfectly delicious room temperature regular butter.  i'm kind of getting sick of the flavored butters at all these restaurants.  these guys get the details.  the silverware is unique and gorgeous (paul said it cost them $4,000 for the set).  the bathroom is nice and has real towels, which i like.  i didn't try the desserts, but i'm sure they're good.  check this place out, it's a winner.  they deserve your business and have reasonable prices, good staff, and great food.  one last thing.. starting on tuesday's they have a 4 course special for $35.

Vi'm really impressed with the chef's ambition, but not five-starred by the follow through.\u000a\u000afour people in my group, we all ordered the tasting menu, and all got four different four-course meals.  some of the details were slightly off; the rice, risotto, and black beans that were used as sides were either over or undercooked by a good ways.  each course was delicious, each wine pairing was great, and i'll head back again.\u000a\u000adessert wasn't included in the four courses; budget another $5 for that.\u000a\u000aservice was so-so; the waitress wasn't 100% on the wine list, and it took awhile to get to the food after we ordered.\u000a\u000athe entire room we were in had eight tables, of which ours was the largest.  call ahead for reservations.\u000a\u000asummary: will eat there again.

V3.5 stars.  i really wanted to absolutely fall in love with toast.  i really did, but something just didn't click with me; more on that later.\u000a\u000awe ended up going with a party of 6 on a wednesday night; we scoured yelp to find a place to eat and ended up calling in various restaurants to see if they could squeeze us in (toast had a time slot open at 8 pm).  they have a regular menu, but on tuesdays and wednesdays they have a chef's tasting menu for $30 w/ an optional $20 wine pairing, so most of us decided upon that option.\u000a\u000anow the chef's tasting menu at toast is a four course ordeal where it's a grab bag of what you're going to get as opposed to a standard set menu.  you'll be asked if you have any food allergies or restrictions, and then the chef cooks whatever he likes and it's luck of the draw for what you end up getting served since no two dishes were the same (i told my waiter i was allergic to everything but lobster).  i have a feeling the waiters were the final deciders of who would get what dish.  because of this, there's no real flow to the meal as the flavors of each course might not work well together.  the progression of courses starts with an appetizer followed by a seafood dish, then a salad of sorts and it ends with a meat dish.\u000a\u000athe food was cooked well, but i had issues with the use of "side dishes" by the chef.  also, none of the food was really memorable; nor did any of the dishes really strike me as particularly inspired.  my seafood dish consisted of a small fish fillet complemented with a few strips of roasted potatoes.  the fish was tender with a perfectly crisped skin; however, i'm not sure roasted potatoes were the best choice to be paired with this fish as it seemed more of an arbitrary "side dish" as opposed to being an actual part of the entree.  my meat dish was roast duck (medium rare) served with black eyed peas.  like with the fish, the black eyed peas seemed to not really fit in with the dish either.\u000a\u000ai guess my main gripe is that the dishes would've been better completely decomposed; the sum was less than that of all its parts.\u000a\u000afor the purposes of yelp, my review is rounded up to 4 stars b/c the atmosphere and decor were appropriate and they were extremely accommodating even though we lacked formal reservations.  also, even though i complained a lot about their dishes, $30 for a four course tasting menu is extremely wallet friendly and definitely a good "deal" for the price.

Vi had heard a lot about toast from a friend and was excited to try it. unfortunately, i was underwhelmed. i ordered fish over a bed of rice, and the rice was very dry - not basmati try but dry to the point of being hard and undercooked. the rest of my food was average, but i think there are better restaurants in pittsburgh at this price range.\u000a\u000awhere toast shines is as a wine bar. the wine list is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate. parties are seated close together, and if i were to give toast another try, it would likely be on a date.

Vmy boyfriend and i came here with a reservation on a friday night around 6:30.  we were seated right away in the dark downstairs dining room, where the walls are lined with wood, and the wood is lined with wine bottles.  our seating was comfortable, and not too close to the table next to us (relief).  the restaurant didn't seem incredibly busy - comfortably populated, but a few empty tables scattered around.  you might not even need a reservation.\u000a\u000aour server was very casual, in his dress and demeanor (jeans and black button downs seem to be the uniform).  his interactions with us were a little lax, a little moreso than i expected, given that it's a somewhat pricey joint, but he was knowledgeable and happy to give recommendations, which is always appreciated.\u000a\u000athe menu changes daily, so there are no specials.  everything is a special, in that sense.  the wine list, printed on the back, was absolutely delightful since almost every bottle can be ordered in a taster portion, a half glass, a full glass, or a bottle.  lovely!  i ordered three tasters throughout the evening, and it was such a fun experience.  we drank white with our appetizers, red for dinner, and sparkling for dessert.  i was never too drunk or too full of wine, the price was great, the taster portions were more generous than i expected, and i got to try five kinds of wine.  hard to beat.\u000a\u000awe had a montravel from spain, which my boyfriend loved, and their riesling, which i loved.  both wines were flavorful and unique, and it was a truly great experience to have excellent wine again, compared to our usual bottles purchased cheaply from the store.  our appetizers were the mac and cheese (goat cheese, local sausage, and a fried egg in the dish), and the stuffed poblano peppers.  the mac 'n' cheese was good, creamy but not too heavy, and the pasta was orzo which was fun.  but the peppers  - just to die for.  to.  die.  they had been roasted, it seems, or grilled, and were filled with the most flavorful housemade pork sausage.  we were both bowled over.  if this is on the menu, don't miss it.  their sausage is the real deal.\u000a\u000anext we got two tasters of red, the cotes-du-rhone and something else....also very uniquely flavored and rich wines.  our entrees were the suckling pig and the hanger steak.  the steak was my favorite - cooked to a delightful medium rare and served with roasted potatoes and rutabegas, it was simple and unpretentious.  great beef flavor, nothing too intrusive or unusual.  just high quality food.  the pig was good as well - the texture was divine, soft and reminiscent of pulled pork only better.  the sweet potato mash alongside was great.  my only complaint was the sauce was, in my opinion, too salty.  anything it touched became too salty, and the sweet potato mash was needed to cut through that sodium taste.  i think it bothered me more than it bothered my boyfriend.  we absolutely finished both plates, practically licking them clean, but i'd watch out for that sauce if you're sensitive to salt.\u000a\u000afor dessert i had a glass of moscato, sweet and lovely, and we split the "peanut butter ice cream sandwich" which seemed more like a peanut butter pie, but who's complaining?  it was very good and a great end to the meal.\u000a\u000aall this for about $75.  the way they price their wines makes all the difference, and a great meal instantly becomes much more affordable than you'd expect.  i'd recommend toast! to anyone, especially wine lovers.  it was such a treat, and didn't break the bank.

Vi've actually been a long fan of toast's, even though i never put in a formal review.  but i have to say that despite it having been one of my favorite places to go in town when it first opened, the last three times i've gone, it's been a let down.  don't get me wrong - it's not that it's bad.  it's just that, given some of the other options around pittsburgh nowadays, i no longer find this acceptable.\u000a\u000athe chef's tasting deal on tuesdays is a great way to introduce yourself to toast, if you haven't been.\u000a\u000alast night, we went, and the food was meh.  some of us ordered off the main menu, others went with the chef's tasting.  i got fried rice with escargots as my starter, and it was underwhelming.  i prefer escargot with tons of butter, and serving an asian person fried rice is just insulting (i'm actually kidding a bit here, but i'll admit that i'm snobby about the fried rice).  my next course was salmon on carrot puree, which was excellent, and the highlight of my meal.  next up was wild greens, which was a good salad, but nothing special.  last course was skirt steak on pureed celery and glazed carrots.  and that was seriously overcooked.  as my tablemate said, it tasted like beef jerky.\u000a\u000aso, i'll admit that i feel kind of bad, since i should have just sent it back.  but, i also don't think that the onus should ever be on the customer.  it's just a bad position to be in.\u000a\u000afrom now on, i'm taking my business elsewhere.  salt is in this same price point, and infinitely more exciting and consistent in terms of quality.

Vthe first time i went to "the other bbt" (as opposed to the much more established bloomfield bridge tavern) i liked it. they have a nice looking bar/restaurant. i ate a burger, which was pretty good. and, the bartender and owner did come over to us and chat it up a bit. the owner tooted his own horn about his wings (which i did not order). i love wings so i made a mental note to try it next time. all in all, a pleasant experience. in my mind, i decided that this could be a good after work/local bar, especially given the south side location, even if it is a couple blocks from the real action.\u000a\u000ai went back again this week, and i was sorely disappointed in my second experience. the bar is still nice - clean with a nice aura, not a dive. but, a few things went wrong: first, when we finally got to order, the bartender denied my request for wings because they were out. okay, if you have signs that say "best wings in pittsburgh," you don't run out of wings! second, they didn't adhere to the new no smoking law. it was like 8pm, not 1am; and there were a few tables of customers. if i had known, i would not have gone there because i just didn't plan on stinking when i left that night. \u000a\u000aso here it is, a 2-star rating. the food is not bad (still haven't tried the wings), but it's nowhere near great. if you have to go, order a burger or the veggie wrap - those are good. i really want to like this bar, but they're not giving me any good reason to like it that much. everything is just okay, even though the bar itself is nicely kept. \u000a\u000a[the other] bbt, you'll have to give me a better reason to keep you around!

Vmy new favorite bar in pittsburgh. who knew highlighters and booze can be so much fun? the drinks are simple and strong, bartenders are nice and breathe fire, the crowd is a very diverse mix including a guy in a hot dog costume and a bouncer wearing a santa claus outfit.

Vanother fine establishment that i have outgrown. i haven't been to this place in years but it was always a good time. the only way to describe the place is...different. you enter through meat curtains (go ahead, chuckle) into a land of tin foil and twigs decorating the bar. make sure you bring a highlighter so you can draw on your inebriated comrades. order a drink, get some toys.

Vsomething can be said about a bar off the beaten path in an area infamous for bars.  if it is your first time venturing here, you may get lost finding the place.\u000a\u000aon a tiny corner on 11th and bradish in the bar soaked area of the south side you'll find a magical place called bar 11.  don't be fooled by the bio-hazard curtain on the door, walk right in.  the room is slender but almost always packed.  don't even think about getting a beer here (not that it's not a good idea, you have more fun with the mixed drinks, more on that later).  upon getting your first drink you should receive the coveted candy necklace ice breaker.  adorn yourself with this necklace, let the alcohol do it's work and you could be hitting it off with someone new that you never met before, that or a vampire/zombie has latched onto your neck.  back to the mixed drinks, doesn't matter what type of mixed drinks you are up for, they can make 'em...and make 'em good they do.  the trick to it is that they give you these awesome party favor type gifts with your drinks, my favorite by far to date were my whistle lips.\u000a\u000anow, about the atmosphere, if you are not one of these people that like to be elbow to elbow with people, this place is not for you unless you go early in the night to avoid the people.  the decorations in this place has ranged from aluminum foil wallpaper to bikes hanging from the ceiling.  the only tv in the place for the most part only runs cartoons.  pick up a name tag from the bar and write your name or an eye catching phrase to draw attention to yourself.  after a few drinks, you'll forget about the name tags and start writing on each others skin, who really cares, it really only shows up under the black lights.  the music ranges, but who can argue with the selection in a bar such as bar 11, especially if say the backstreet boys' 'i want it that way' comes on and the whole bar is singing along to it?\u000a\u000athe bathrooms are a bit cramped, but who cares, i'm sure by the end of the night you won't be caring much about that part of the experience when you go to bar 11.\u000a\u000aonce you go, you'll be back.

Vbar 11 is a party house(dive bar) located a few blocks off of carson street. from the outside, it really looks like a nondescript building, save for a few drunk [birthdays,bachelorettes,frat-house-runoffs] entering and the muddy sound of lady-gaga-through-concrete on the sidewalk. entering for your first time can cause a bit of sensory overload - it's tiny, dirty, and dark, with blacklights, lasers, and red spotlights providing most of the lighting. \u000a\u000athe decor seems to be anything that could be found underneath something desirable in your least favorite thrift store - much of it hung from the ceiling. the walls and bar are plastered with "hi my name is" stickers, which are usually passed out at the door. early in the night you might be tempted to write your favorite fake name or movie character and wear it all night - later in the night a crude phallic outline will probably be a better fit. there are highlighters getting passed around - beware if you have an aversion to getting scribbled on. on the wall that holds the atm hangs a large printed mat in the style of exposed brick, and in the corner there is a dart machine - not that there is any space to play darts, and even if there was you would hit the atm before you stood far enough back to play. the bathrooms are dirty.\u000a\u000abehind the bar is a cooler of beer - there is a selection, but not an interesting one. i've seen a craft or two, but it's usually just an expanded selection of macros(think franziskaners, bass ale, etc). the bartenders can be hard to flag down, they're almost always making drinks, sometimes for customers, sometimes for themselves. when they aren't making drinks - or even while they are - they often perform antics. there is a drumset hanging from the ceiling, and a few electronic pads hooked up to the sound system, and a microphone. they'll get a few beats played on them every song, but thriller got a full drum overlay. randomly, the bar might get lit on fire, shortly followed by blowing flaming whiskey into the air.\u000a\u000ai don't particularly find this place to have the best drinks for a dirty dive bar. you're looking over $5 for most drinks, and while they are all served in pint glasses, i've usually found them to be weak. that being said, you do receive a handful of plastic trinkets or candy necklaces with each order. but let's be honest, if you're coming here, you should probably already be good on the alcohol and just have a drink to hold you over.\u000a\u000athe best part of bar 11 is the party - the playlist is eclectic, focusing mainly on the 90s with a splash of recent hits and songs from the 80s and earlier. most of the people not sitting at the bar are dancing wherever there is enough space - which around midnight might be at a premium. people sing along to their favorites - weezer's say it ain't so was a hit, jackson's billie jean had its chorus sung over the sound system, and bowie's rebel rebel was the high point of the night, if only in my mind. around midnight, today's hot techno flavor came on(in 2012, that's a remix of avicii's levels) - the bartender puts down his bottles in a hurry and rushes over to the lights. the bar goes black, a couple seconds later the lazers come on. soap(or some other cloudy substance) shoots out of a machine in the ceiling, glittering in the red and green lights. fog machines are in full effect, a detached police light(again, on the ceiling) starts spinning. over the next few songs, the house lights slowly return to normal, only to have it all happen again.\u000a\u000abar 11 is certainly worth a stop, especially if you happen to already have parking in the south side and a couple of drinks in you. they do take credit cards with a $10 minimum, and they do allow smoking, but i haven't found it to be overwhelming, even on my clothes when i leave - but it is definitely there, just not to say belvedere's level, and the cover on weekends is usually about $3.

Vthis place still gets four stars from me.  i still love it here even if i can't get here as often as i did in the past.  nothing in here has changed, which is a good thing.  might i also say that this place isn't so bad to visit during the day time either (st. patrick's day).\u000a\u000athe most recent visit was just as fun as the past.  lots of people bumping into one another, putting those candy necklace ice breakers to the test.  the music was blaring, people were loud, and hearing was at a minimum.  when i come in here, i usually stick to a margarita, which is what i ordered.  i had a bit of a wait, but it was for the good.  they needed more limes, so i had fresh limes for my margarita.  the bartenders were very friendly as well, making it about a hundred times better.\u000a\u000ai definitely need to stop in here more often, but only if i have the day after off...if you know what i mean.

Vpenn station isn't bad but not exactly a place i would try again. the subs were decent, probably better than subway but nowhere near as good as quizno's. quizno's simply uses better ingredients, has subs that seemed to be crafted by a chef, so all of the flavors compliment each other while penn stations subs seem  more haphazardly thrown together and then toasted. \u000a\u000atheir fries are fresh, blanched first and then finished the second time in oil and as another reviewer put are greasy but good. overall their food is adequate, with a slightly higher prices like quizno's but without the high quality and taste of a quizno's.

Vi really wanted to enjoy this place after reading reviews and hearing good things about it from friends...........(yes, there's a but, a big old butt).\u000a\u000abut...\u000a\u000awhen i ordered something went wrong, way wrong.  either they need to up their medical coverage benefits or hire new, competent staff.  i ordered a club sub cold (hearing check).  the slip showed what ordered (eye check).  what i got was a toasted sub...ugh, all i wanted was a cold sub.\u000a\u000ai didn't want a toasted bread, melted cheese or hot meat.  i wanted it nice and cold.  i hate having wilty type of lettuce, tomatoes don't taste the same to me, and when you add the sauce beforehand and heat it up, it doesn't taste the same.\u000a\u000ai may give this place a second chance, but only after the bad taste is out of my mouth.

Vthis place seems to be halfway through a name-change and was formerly yen's gourmet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/yens-gourmet-pittsburgh#hrid:jfhdfltrvz3f82lyfibzfq).   this is cheap, neighborhood takeout at its best.\u000a\u000alunches include an entree, rice, and soup or a soda, and most of them are under $5.  most entrees are under $9 (except seafood entrees - the most expensive of which is $10.95).  the food is good and the restaurant is clean.  there is a big dining room with a cool circular doorway and the kind of typical chinese knick-knacks you usually see, but it's fairly tastefully done. \u000a\u000aas far as food goes, their vegetable fried rice includes more veggies than usual, and the sesame tofu is deliciously crispy.  it has 2 pieces of broccoli on the side, so you can pretend it's good for you.  the vegetable spring rolls are really tiny, but you get 2 for $1.50 so you can't really complain.  the hot & sour soup appears to have no beef - good news for vegetarians.  they also have some cool combination dinners where you get soup, a spring roll, a chicken wing, rice, an entree and a cookie for $10.50.  how this place makes any money is beyond me.  the only thing i haven't liked so far was the vegetables in yu-shang garlic sauce, but everything else has been good.\u000a\u000aif you live in the neighborhood, definitely check out china star.  you get a lot of bang for your buck, it's fast and it's never crowded.

Vthis is delicious chinese take out! for meat eaters, they have this great dinner deal where you get a soup, an eggroll, some sort of entree like cashew chicken and a cookie for under $10! they also deliver, don't have a minimum on credit cards and are overall great.

Vi order from china star all the time, mostly because it is two minutes from my house.  their food is pretty good, and for $7.50 you get a dinner that includes soup, an egg roll, fried or steamed rice and a large (although they call it "small") portion of entree.  i make two or three meals out of a general tso's combo dinner.\u000a\u000amy favorites here are the crab rangoon and wonton soup.  deelish!

Voh, man, did i ever order from the wrong china star! i should have read meghan c's review first, for the correct location, but the food is also uninspired and mediocre at best. \u000a\u000ai call in a delivery order, and she tells me that it's an hour for delivery. could i pick up? yeah, sure, whatever. i place my order, and then she calls back to say they have no duck, and that i need to pick another entree. ok... after i drive to the wrong (an bustling) china star in squirrel hill, i make my way to the correct (and completely empty) china star in greenfield. boy, this food sure is disgusting. \u000a\u000ahot and sour soup: inedible; vegetable spring rolls: stone cold, pale, and inedible; double delight: chicken was stone cold, and the white sauce was a gloppy mess. the menu is already in the recycling, and maybe i'll try the other china star next time.

Vas others described this place, standard and reliable.\u000a\u000aordered with coworkers for dinner tonight and was satisfied and underwhelmed all in one, if that's possible.  \u000a\u000afor the satisfied part, i was surprised by the amount of food i received.  i order the general tso's (old reliable) combination plate.  unlike other places when you order and combo plate you get soup and an egg roll on top of the entree.  to me, soup from a chinese restaurant is nothing more than a tea with food in it.  the egg roll was surprisingly good.  i think they may have mistakenly gave me a shrimp egg roll instead of the run of the mill regular egg roll (not complaining there).  as for the entree, their "small portion" was that of any other place; read - not small.\u000a\u000aas for the underwhelming aspect of the food, the fried rice may have been fried a bit too much.  some of the chicken pieces were a bit dry.  for being general tso's, it wasn't nearly spicy enough for me.  \u000a\u000ain a pinch, this place sure can fill the void when you are in a rush.

Vif you're like me and think pizza never has enough cheese on it, then pizza pronto is going to be your new favorite pizza delivery place.  the dough style is american, and they have a fair selection of toppings.  i've only given them 3 stars because they did not deliver my complete order, but i'm looking forward to giving them another try to bump it up to 4 stars.  the pizza i got had feta and capicola, and it was really good.  the feta was plentiful and nice and salty, and the pizza has lasted me for days now!  they also serve hoagies, salads, pasta dinners, wings, burgers and calzones.  enjoy!

Vthe pizza has too much cheese, is too greasy, and is not great. the gyro is average to good. the burgers were surprisingly good for a pizza delivery place. better than a lot of delivery pizza in the area, but nothing special.

Vyou know a wise old lady once said that a milkshake could bring the boys to the yard, but i have to differ with her when she said hers was better.  the milk shake factory must of heard this and thought it was a challenge and not only excepted the challenge, but put her in her place.\u000a\u000ato choose a milkshake here is mind boggling.  i mean i felt like a kid in a candy store (i could have been with all the chocolaty goodness everywhere).  my mind started to race and i just couldn't decide which one i wanted more.  i felt like i was on a game show like 'who wants to be a milkshake' and when i decided it was my final answer.\u000a\u000aopting for the cookie dough fudge was definitely my millionaire decision.  once that concoction hit my tongue, euphoric is all i can say.  if you pass this place up, there are no life lines in the world that can save you.

Vis there such a thing as a good tourist trap?  seriously folks, this place is it!  i mean you feel like the stereotypical tourist rube when you pay your money and go in.  but it's so well done you can't help but have fun.\u000a\u000aand the place has been a tourist trap for over 150 years.  you can go up to the victorian rooftop chamber.  there you'll see live moving images of edinburgh projected onto a viewing table through a giant periscope. it's cool because you can pick people up with your hands and move them all around.  i found their technical information on their website http://www.camera-obscura.co.uk/camera_obscura/pdf/camera_technical_information.pdf\u000a\u000acamera obscura is on several levels.  you can see the magic gallery in which you can perform hands-on illusions and the light fantastic which is one of the largest hologram exhibits in europe.  my overall favorite has to be edinburgh vision.  here you can see new and old edinburgh using 3d photos, stereoscopes, and anaglyphs.  the best though were the live viewcams.  here you can watch the people of edinburgh go by.  you can get an extreme close up of the architectural details of the city and also a great view of the hills and countryside surrounding edinburgh. \u000a\u000acamera obscura is the sightseeing equivalent of eating a bowl of popcorn while watching your favorite bad movie.  it's extremely entertaining, but oh such a guilty pleasure!

Vi think the only reason i'm doing this review so early is because i'm desperately trying to stay awake.  it's 6:30pm here in edinburgh and my husband and i arrived from pittsburgh this morning.  international travel really takes a toll on my body and it normally takes me a day or so to recuperate.\u000a\u000abut anyways, the best way to describe this place?  well, it's a holiday inn!  it's a typical chain hotel with typical amenities.  the rooms are a little smaller than what most of us from the u.s. are accustomed to.  but ours is pleasant enough.  it seems clean, has typical amenities, a nice tv, seems reasonably quiet, and the bed seems reasonably comfortable.  i understand this place caters to a lot of tour groups, so we'll find out how quiet it is tonight.\u000a\u000aas i mentioned, it normally takes me a day to recover from an overnight flight.  this place does have a swimming pool and fitness center, so i'll check 'em out tomorrow.  it's also right down the block from the edinburgh zoo, so if i feel up to it, i'll wander over there.  rick's going to go find his model railroad store and probably do a little trainwatching (or trainspotting as they call it here).  good for him!  \u000a\u000aoh one other thing.  this hotel is a few miles from the city center (downtown), but it is on a major bus route.

Vthe national trust for scotland operates the historic georgian house in edinburgh.  the house is located on charlotte square, close to the center of edinburgh.   it's a fine example of georgian era homes, dating back to the late 1700s and early 1800s.  i've always enjoyed viewing historic homes, be they monticello, clayton, mt. vernon, and the hermitage.  i like learning how people lived through their furnishings, toys, games, costumes, and fashions.  here at the georgian house, i was fascinated by the period furniture, porcelain, silver and glass.  \u000a\u000alike a lot of historic homes, we got a chance to be transported back to the past.  the docents here are in full costume and they stay in character to answer questions about what life was like at the house and in new town circa 1800.  methinks they hired local actors because they played their parts so well.  they also have something great for the little ones here.  kids can try on period costumes, try their hands at everyday items like writing with quill pens and playing with period toys, and work on art and coloring projects.  makes me wish i was a kid again!  \u000a\u000athey appear to host a lot of events here and the drawing room can be rented out for private parties.  if you're one for historic houses, put this one on your list.

Vhad a really nice birthday dinner here after drinks next door at the bon vivant.  the interior is modern and casually elegant - you don't have to dress up to eat here but you certainly could!\u000a\u000awe started with some red wine, and the tiger cry - a salad of barbecued beef that was allegedly so spicy it would bring tears to a tiger's eyes!  that may have been pushing it a bit - there was certainly spice involved, but nothing we couldn't handle with ease.  lots of great sweet-salty thai flavor, however.  we got the bangkok duck, crispy and dripping with deliciously sweet sticky sauce.  it was a very large portion (for europe, anyway!) and along with the talay sam rod, we had a very large, beautiful meal!  the talay sam rod is a fish dish - char grilled monkfish, scallops, and prawns, in a beautiful sauce with tamarind, kaffir lime, and thai basil (which was a lovely, herbal accompaniment).  seafood was perfectly cooked - i can still taste taht scallop!  both were delicious with the fragrant coconut rice.  could not finish, though we gave it a valiant effort!\u000a\u000aquite busy on a saturday night at 7 pm, so i'd make a reservation at the weekend for sure.  this place is relaxed and inexpensive enough that you could justify going anytime, but it's also elegant enough to go there on a special night.  i'd say it's perfect for people like us, two poor kids with something to celebrate!

Vmexican food in the uk?  you can understand i was pretty skeptical - no offense, but this is not something that your country has down.  but my expat friend recommended it, and she did not lead us astray!\u000a\u000acame for lunch on a sunday, they opened up at noon.  interior is small, but bright, colorful, and cheery.  service was some of the friendliest i'd had in the uk.  they put a little plate of spicy popcorn on the table, which is a nice touch, and much less filling than the loads of chips/salsa you'd get at a mexican restaurant in the us - for better or for worse.  i got the veggie fajitas and my boyfriend got the carnitas burrito, which he'd been craving all day - and a side of chips, despite my protest that that was a strange accompaniment to mexican food.\u000a\u000amy fajitas were really nice and light - just squash, mango, and regular fajita veg flambeed with tequila (in front of me!) and lightly seasoned - delicious in a tortilla with salsa and guac.  definitely needed some hot sauce though!  didn't try  my boyfriend's burrito, which he really liked, but wow was it messy!  when he cut into it, sauce just poured out.  i munched on the hot, crispy chips, loving them as i thought to myself "why am i eating fries with mexican food?"\u000a\u000ait's a bit pricey, but it's competitive in terms of taste with mexican-american food, and that's all i'd hoped for!  oh - nothing is that spicy though.  they have a bunch of hot sauces displayed, they gave my boyfriend the mildest which he tried and immediately asked for two levels up.  he tried that one and asked for one more.  they had to check and see if they had any of the hottest one, finally bringing it -  more of a chile paste, really - in a bowl.  even that was spicy, but not so bad!  i had a dollop on a chip and it was spicy, but not what you'd expect from what is literally the spiciest sauce in the house!  that's the one thing i'd ask from tex mex ii - turn up the heat, guys!

Varrgh!  we got here only to discover half of it was closed for renovations.  it's a is a 46 million project to renovate museum into a top-notch attraction for people from around the world.  \u000a\u000awe did however see a fascinating exhibit on the lewis chessman, which is currently touring scotland.  these were chess pieces that were discovered in a shipwreck.  we also saw "scotland: a changing nation", which showed how much scottish society changed in the 20th century.  we discovered in "leaving scotalnd" why more scots left their homeland during the 20th century than in any other period, and how they made new lives overseas.  my husband rick particularly enjoyed the scottish sports hall of fame (even though he's 100% italian-american) and jackie stewart's racing car.  \u000a\u000abut i'd have to say my favorite was "one nation, five million voices", a  cross-section of people giving their personal views on what it means to be scottish.  \u000a\u000aso yeah, three stars for the museum while it's under renovation.  i'm sure the place'll be bumped up to five once it reopens in full.  and it is worth a morning's stop.

Vthis is yet another new good addition to east liberty.  this new little restaurant is located basically above richard chen next to borders.  there is ample parking and the space itself is very nice.  it's a small restaurant with about seating for 40 i'd guess and a small bar with about 6 stools.  the restaurant is surrounded by big floor to ceiling windows and makes you feel like you are sitting in a fish bowl (in a good way).  it has an open kitchen with a good looking pizza oven.  i'm not sure what to make of the furniture itself.  most of the tables and bar stools are metal and the chairs are orange.  it is bright and seemed a bit out of place on a dark, cold, wintery (sp?) east liberty fall night.  however, i'm sure it is better appreciated in the summer.  this is definitely a kid friendly restaurant and i saw many families enjoying their delicious pizza.  my friend liz and i sat at the bar and had very good service all evening long by sean who had about an average palate for wine.  the wine prices were quite good and i don't think there was anything over $10 per glass.  i enjoyed a nice italian syrah and i think liz stuck to sauvignon.  they keep the menu small choosing to focus on just doing a few things really really good.  we started with the salami platter.  it was very good quality proscioutto, salami, and some type of other italian ham.  it was served with caper berries which are really good if you have never tried them.  the meats were high quality.  next we shared the steamed mussels.  the broth was delicious.  the mussels were i'd estimate only of average quality.  you know when you get really good and fresh plump mussels and these were not those.  it also came with a slice of grilled ciabatta.  the bread was good, but since we were sharing i would have preferred another slice to soak up the great sauce.  then we split there pizza "for one" which was really good pizza.  if you try nothing else when you come here try the pizza.  the pizza had a great thin crust and high quality ingredients like fingerling potatoes, good onions and a fried egg on top.  lastly, we split a dessert which was really rich and reminded me of something i couldn't quite place from my youth.  it was the "pot de creme" which was like some kind of chocolate creme brulee'.  we had two espressos' before we left and the whole night was about $95 for everything.  the portions are smaller by pittsburgh standards, but i thought it was perfect.  this is a good date place i'd say.  at the end of the night we spoke with the chef/owner who was very nice and has an interesting background.  they try to do the whole eco friendly thing here which is a plus.  this is a good spot and hopefully soon i'll consider it a great spot.

Vdinette's menu consists mostly of pizzas with interesting and unusual toppings which are changed on a daily basis. i got to sample several of these which were all decent, but none of them were super exciting. the clam pizza, for example, only had five small (in shell!) clams on it and otherwise tasted like a cheese pizza. \u000a\u000aappetizers were fairly tasty, and they have a small selection of beer and wine to choose from as well as a few desserts. this is not a bad place, but it's also not nearly as exciting as i'd hoped from all the good things i've heard. for the price, i was a bit underwhelmed.

Vdinette is a bright cheerful restaurant in east liberty serving up delicious food right next to borders.  their main focus is on using local and sustainable ingredients.\u000a\u000ai ordered their prosciutto pizza which came topped with arugula, mozzarella, and beautiful strips of parmigiano reggiano.  my buddy ordered their salt-cured anchovies pizza which came with chilies, capers, tomatoes and mozzarella.  after we ordered, we saw another table get their appetizer which looked absolutely delicious, so i asked our waitress what it was called (it was the fritto misto) and if we could add an order of it.\u000a\u000athe fritto misto was basically battered onion rings, broccoli and portobello mushrooms topped with small chilies.  the batter was super light and well seasoned and everything was cooked to perfection.  the portion is just right for two people to share without it being overwhelming.\u000a\u000athe pizza is of the thin crust variety and they are big.  well, bigger than i expected.  i was sufficiently full 2/3's of the way through, but i did finish my pizza and get a dessert too (gluttonous what?).  so first of all i absolutely love thin crust pizza.  also, i like how the pizza isn't greasy.  it gives a clean feeling and lets the ingredients be the main focus of each pizza.  i tried a slice of the salt-cured anchovie pizza and i liked it more than my prosciutto pizza.  it's not that my pizza was bad, i think in the end i just prefer my prosciutto cold.  they have a good number of pizza choices so i'm sure i'll find one that suits me the best.\u000a\u000ai ended the night with the "chocolate pot de creme", which was super dense and rich.\u000a\u000awould i recommend it?  yes.  it's slightly pricier than i expected (30-ish per person), but then again i did add an appetizer to split and a a dessert at the end, which makes it perfectly reasonable.  it's more spendy than what i would want for a weekly trip so i won't be there too often, but i really like their fresh ingredients and the clean simple tastes have me feeling guilt free afterwards.

Vthis is an adorable little restaurant.  many of the walls are covered in large windows, and the room fills with sunlight in the evening.  also since the restaurant is up high, you get a nice view of east liberty.  parking was easy, in the lot just off highland.\u000a\u000athey don't take reservations, and its a very tiny place, but we didn't wait more than about 20 minutes and there were twelve of us, so that's pretty amazing.  everything at our table was just cute - the fun orange chairs, the simple flowers in glass vases - the decor was clean, with just a hint of quirk.  ikea chic?\u000a\u000athe menu is small, and the ingredients are fresh.  tomatoes and herbs are grown in a rooftop garden.  also, the chef is a very talented woman who is a james beard award semi-finalist, so i had some pretty high expectations!  i love supporting restaurants with female chefs.\u000a\u000aso the wine by the glass was a wee bit pricey (about 1/4 the cost of the bottle, around $8-10 per glass).  i wanted some wine, but since they had beers for much cheaper, i settled for a victory prima pils, which the server poured for me.  dinette also offers $1 cans of yuengling, which many of my dining companions enjoyed.  pop is $2.50 for just a small bottle, but they pour it into your glass and give you a *metal* straw to drink with.  i got a huge kick out of that - don't think i've ever seen a straw like that before....\u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i started with the grilled shishito peppers.  the dish comes with about 10 small grilled peppers, about the size of a jalapeno but less spicy.  they had nice grill marks, and were hanging out in a bath of luscious olive oil (really fruity, high quality stuff) accompanied by some creamy goat cheese and crunchy fried almonds.  all the components of the dish worked well together -the flavors were simple and well-matched.  i just hated to waste all that olive oil still pooling at the bottom of the bowl!\u000a\u000athen we had the grilled chicken wings.  i was excited about the "romesco sauce with ancho chile," but i have to say the overwhelming flavor of the wings was....chicken.  grilled, a little charred, chicken.  which was good, but i didn't get the spice, the pizazz.  less flavorful than i expected.  simple and high quality no doubt, but i like a little more zing to my food.\u000a\u000awe also split the prosciutto pizza, which was very good.  the crust was thin and crispy (occasionally a little char taste, but that's what you get with thin crust, oven-fired pizza).  sauce was light, and there was delicious bite from the arugula and the parmigiano-reggiano.  i really enjoyed it.\u000a\u000anext time i think we might skip the starters, maybe just some marinated olives or something, and get two pizzas.  the pizzas are definitely the star of the show, and i wish we'd gotten to try more.  i had a bite of the fingerling potato pizza and i wasn't wowed, but i prefer my pizzas with tomato.\u000a\u000aoh also, the service was lovely and the host guy was cute and funny.  i had to leave early and snuck behind the host stand to read a menu to add up my total cost, and then the host comes up to the stand and goes "table for two please!"  hilaaaaarious!\u000a\u000ai'd love to come back and get a few pizzas and maybe suck it up and get a bottle of wine.  very cute place.

Vthere is something to be said for doing something better than anyone else.  dinette has a limited menu, but the owner/chef keeps a perfectionist control on everything served in the restaurant.  right down to the bread sticks, which are awesome.  i love the wine list, it's one of the best and most imaginative in the city.  sometimes you should go for the bottle, because the price point often works out better.  i don't care for the chairs, i wish they had some funky old dinette chairs, but that's the only thing i can think to criticize. check the hours before you go, they are not open on sunday or monday, and not open for lunch.

Vmy husband and i consider dinette one of our go-to places for dinner. two appetizers and a pizza to share is perfect for our appetites. we have consistently enjoyed their creative salads and starters, and you really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas. the fact that they try to stay on top of what is in season is only another plus, in our book. the only downside, in terms of food, are their desserts. we haven't tried a single one that we've liked, and usually go across the street to spoon if we are in dire need of some sugar.\u000a\u000ait gets a bit loud, and it toes the line between being a nicer sit down place, and more casual eatery. highly recommended. if you are familiar with delfina pizza in the mission district of sf, this is pretty much a blow by blow copy? predecessor? to that. but with less hipsters.

Vi can finally check dinette off my list of places to try and add to my list of places to frequent.\u000a\u000ait took only a split second to decide to come here after attempting to go elsewhere, the best split second decision i've ever made.  when i pulled up and parked, seeing that the inside was jam packed was a good indication i was in for some awesome food.  i waited for a friend to show up before i ventured inside, giving me time to scope out the place as i chatted on my phone.  the dining area itself isn't very big, but it is set up in just a way that they make the best out of what they got.  tables enough to make it comfortable, and there is seating at the bar.  there are bar seats that are situation in front of the prep area as well, so you can watch them construct the pizzas as the orders come in.  a little thing i liked about this place is that you get to see the kitchen area as well from outside.  you can see them preparing the ingredients used in the pizzas being made up front.\u000a\u000awhen i finally did walk in, i was greeted instantly, was told there would be a wait (expected), and that we could mingle at the bar and the host would come get us when a table was ready.  the bar area is kind of fun, kind of intimate.  it's a small area towards the back, dimly lit, and fun.  only four stools to sit on and the rest is standing.  but no need to fret, even if you stand you have a place to put your drink of choice.  if you do stand, you get to look out at the east liberty skyline, or watch the people pass by on the street.  the handrail doubles as a place to stash your drink.  the drink selection is limited.  if you are expecting a place where you can choose from a huge list with only beers on it, this place isn't for you.  yes, it's true they have $1 yuengling cans here, but set your sights higher.  a few bottle beers, one from church brew works, and a long list of wines.\u000a\u000athe bartender was nice, and fast.  after asking if eating at the bar was permitted and being informed it was.  i didn't move for the rest of the night.  i finally ordered my pizza and was quite delighted by it.  who knew that hazelnuts would taste amazing on a pizza?  i didn't, but i do now.  mix it with some red onion, gorgonzola, and, chevre, might as well call that a masterpiece.  my friend had the pizza with a fried egg in the middle, i was jealous for just a second that i didn't order that one, but that jealousy faded fast when i went back to my pizza.  i like how on the menu it tells you that it's a pizza for one, but then they bring you what would be considered a medium at one of those national chains.  even though the crust is thin, no reason to try and devour this whole pizza, take those few slices home and enjoy them for breakfast the next morning.\u000a\u000adinette, you are a hidden gem in east liberty.  one that is not lost to me anymore.

Vanybody who knows me can tell you how much i love shopping for cool vintage wear. http://www.yelp.com/list/wpvhbh0j1ibqsbmupuh5ya  there's just something about stylish vintage wear that just really turns me on.  maybe it's the fact that vintage clothes are just better made and fit me better.  maybe it's because most vintage wear wasn't made by some 11 year old sweatshop worker in china.  or maybe it's just 'cos vintage wear is just way more fun!  as i once asked an illinois yelp friend of mine, would you rather have a faux vintage yes concert t-shirt purchased at some big box retailer like target or walmart?  or would you rather have a real vintage yes t?\u000a\u000ai decided to do a little shopping and catch up with my husband rick later on.  i was so thrilled to find this gem of a store.  i understand it is part of a chain in the u.k.  for myself i found a gorgeous art deco  silver & onyx tassle pendant .  for my cousin cindy, i found a lovely set of ancient britian beaten earrings.  and for my husband rick, i got him a vintage union jack watch.\u000a\u000abut oh my!  was i ever the proverbial kid in the candy store here!  they have such wonderful vintage clothes, books, toys, etc.  i could have easily blown our entire vacation budget here!

Vc'mon!  it's marks & spencer!  if you're visiting the u.k., you've gotta stop at marks & spencer.  i remember visiting one in london when i was on a high school field trip many years ago.  as another reviewer says, they're changing their old image in order to lure younger customers.  i remember the one i visited back in '94 was oh-so conservative.  i was shedding my grunge image back then.\u000a\u000ait reminds me of the old kaufmann's in my native pittsburgh before macy's got its hands on that venerable institution.  this place has a foodhall.  kaufmann's had a foodhall.  this place has a bakery, wine shop, and floral shop.  kaufmann's had them too.  this place has electronics and, well you get the idea.\u000a\u000athe women's department reigns supreme here.  although i didn't intend on buying anything, i did manage a couple of fair trade t-shirts.

Vgood chinese delivery.  nothing to die for, but solid food at good prices.  i've had the cold sesame noodles, which were good, though not spicy at all.  the hot and sour soup has nice tofu in it, but could be hotter and sourer.  pork fried rice is good, though the rice is kind of a strange yellow-orange color.  this will probably be my go-to chinese delivery in squirrel hill.

Vnote: this is a divey bar that serves mediterranean food.  this isn't a fancy restaurant where you would bring a date.\u000a\u000aeasy 4 stars.  we dropped by crystal at 8 pm last friday b/c we were on the search for mediterranean food and i remember seeing crystal on diners drive-ins & dives.\u000a\u000athe menu is scattered with basic bar food: burgers, chicken tenders, etc.  the star of the menu though is the bottom corner called "family favorites".  i ordered the "lamb on the rod"; it was the dish featured on triple d and i knew i had to try it out.  the lamb was tender with just a small amount of char on the outside.  it came with wilted onions and peppers, banana peppers, 8 wedges of a pita bread and a dash of sauce that tasted like sour cream.  i would have liked a bit more char for some added smokiness, but the fact that it was grilled perfectly and not dried out was good enough for me.\u000a\u000ai also munched on a lot of my friend's fries; they were greasy and super addicting.  the greasiness was in a good way; the fries were crispy rather than wilted and soggy.\u000a\u000aother pluses:\u000athe kitchen is open until 10 pm nightly and midnight on fridays.\u000aeverything on the menu is below 9 bucks.

Vi can't believe i'm about to say this, but i had quite possibly one of the best burgers of my life here on wednesday night.  it ranks definitely in the top 5 right up there with "in n out" on the left coast and of course tessaros.  it was definitely better than the last burger i had at tessaros or the city grill in the southside.  it's possible i'm being a bit "hyperbolic", (love it when i get a chance to use words like this!!) in that i was really hungry and i had no expectations whatsoever of this place.  annie and i had just left kinkos in the nh (wild and crazy wednesday night!) and i was hungry.  she mentioned this joint in the northside because she knows i love guiness and since it's an irish pub they would be sure to have this nectar of the gods.  it's located right along all of the rowhouses in the mexican war streets in the north side and if it wasn't for the irish flag hanging out front you'd most likely be sure to miss it.  the space itself is perfect.  you enter off the street and you end up directly in the long bar with dark wood.  there are also plenty of two person booths right behind the stools at the bar.  cozy is probably the perfect term to describe this place.  they have an additional dining room in the back, but i'm pretty sure i'll never use it.  the booths are perfect for two people and provide just the right amount of privacy.  if you look closely there is a lot to admire with respect to the space itself (mohogany boothes, crown molding, plenty of brass)  the crowd seems mostly regulars, young physicians in their scrubs,,, older grinders at the bar, plenty of 20 and 30 somethings in everything from jeans to suits.  we luck out because it's $6 burger night and that's exactly what i plan on ordering.  i start with a perfectly poured guinness stout and annie has a relatively stiff vodka/tonic.  we started with a very good cup of french onion soup with plenty of cheese and seasoned perfectly with caramalized onions and a rich broth.  i ordered the "british isles burger" which was a healthy portion (guessing 8 oz.) of fresh (most likely ground that morning) perfectly seasoned (tons of flavor) medium (cooked perfectly) ground beef.  it was served on a warm toasted buttered fresh roll overflowing with gloucester cheese and for additional flavor sprinkled with chives and onions.  they also included some type of sauce on the side, but this burger was perfect no need for any additions.  annie had just a regular cheeseburger with ketchup which looked good, but a little plain compared to the beauty i was enjoying.  the fries were also perfect, thick cut steak fries double dipped in oil and fried for the perfect crunch.  parking can be a little tough and it's not exactly the best neighborhood, but i promise it's worth the effort.  they have other traditional pub fare which i may try on my next visit.

Vthe monterey is just ok.  the food is typical to slightly-better-than-average pub food.  they have specials every day, tuesdays are 35 cent wing night...so it's crowded on tuesdays.  veggie options are light, but they do exist--and the wraps here are pretty good!\u000a\u000amy complaint is that the draft list is always the same five beers, and it's on the pricy side for the area.  you can find better selection at park house on the other side of the 'hood, or modern cafe on the other other side of the 'hood.\u000a\u000ait's in a cute old house, if you're into that, but it's dark, and usually very loud.\u000a\u000awe end up coming here every few weeks because the husband loves the wings, and they are cheap on tuesdays...but other than that, i wouldn't give it any special recommendation.

Vmarvelously charming irish pub with great food and wonderful atmosphere.  i love the tiny booths and the neighborhood charm.  everyone here is so friendly and the staff is attentive and professional.  the wings are delicious, and tuesday night is wing night with 35 wings.  my burger was delicious and perfectly cooked to order. i love the selection of beers on tap.  you really can't miss with the monterey pub!

Vthey're really good about vegetarians, had suggested modifications of on-menu items and a handful of acceptable menu items as well. i went hoping for horse, they were out of horse, i was sad but got over it. steak was very well made, simple seasoning. salads were beautiful and tasty. the space is intimate and relaxed, they have a nice wine list. the chef gave me a bunch of local recommendations, i had a great time.

Vwelcome to the neighborhood, chipotle! \u000a\u000amy co-workers and i have been eagerly awaiting the grand opening for this chipotle, just three blocks away from our office. we have a qdoba nearby already, but we all agree that chipotle is much better. for the past few months, we've seen the old building get torn down, a new building go up, and one day after we all wondered what was going to be there, a sign went up that said "chipotle, coming soon". giddy, giddy, giddy. you can imagine our excitement since all of us are fans. but that sign was mean, because it was up for over a month without any indication as to when "soon" was. come on! that is just way too long to be teased, wouldn't you say?\u000a\u000awell, the time has finally come. november 21st is the grand opening, as the sign outside now says. \u000a\u000ai did pass by today, the day before the grand opening and the inside was curiously crowded. turns out they were having a "training day" for the employees, so thanks to an invitation by the greeter outside, i strolled in for a sneak preview of my - soon to be regular lunch - steak burrito bowl, tortilla on the side, with corn, tomatoes, hot salsa, sour cream, and cheese. optional is the guac, cuz sometimes i feel like a guac, and sometimes i don't. or rather, sometimes i feel like spending an extra $1.80, and sometimes i just don't.\u000a\u000ayay, for chipotle! (that rhymes even tho the spelling is completely different)\u000a\u000a(note: i will refrain from reminding myself and everyone else that you typically run yourself about 800-900 calories on a chipotle burrito.)

Vyes, i know it's a huge chain.  yes, they only serve burritos.  but i had a friend in from out of town who'd never eaten at a chipotle, because friends told him it was mediocre.\u000a\u000athis is the best fast food restaurant i know.  five stars.  i have never had food this fast/cheap/tasty in any form that was repeatable.\u000a\u000aif you're not eating the vegetarian options, the carnitas pork + pinto beans is hands down the best combination.

Vit's probably dumb to review a chain fast-food restaurant, but i will do it anyway.  such is my devotion to yelp.\u000a\u000ai like that this chipotle has a parking lot; it makes it much easier to satisfy our cravings for burrito deliciousness.  every time i've been here, the staff has been very friendly.  it looked to me like their scoops of rice, meat, and salsa, were a bit meager, but i didn't say anything about it.  largely because chipotle can be pretty high calorie as it is - i don't usually count these things, but i did today for kicks and my burrito was 810 calories, and i didn't even get sour cream!  but on the bright side, they claim to use organic produce, cows without hormones, sustainably raised ingredients, and you don't hear that often from a fast-food joint.  the food always tastes fresh.\u000a\u000amy burrito was a little colder than i'd like it - maybe they're all that way and i'm just picky - but i had to put it in the oven to bring it to a good temperature.  nonetheless, it was very tasty as always - "it" being a chicken burrito with corn salsa and cheese.  omnomnom.  it's a lot of food and the price is right.

Vthis chipotle is no different than any other chipotle in the country. i also find it no different than qdoba. the food these two competitive chain restaurants sell are too similar to each other. i find this mind-boggling.\u000a\u000aanyway, i tend to go to this particular chipotle because it's closer to where i live. there is a parking lot, but it is very small. good luck finding a parking space. it tends to get extremely busy during the usual times, lunch and dinner. the lines can get pretty long. the staff works as quickly as they can to serve the customers. however, if the line isn't moving, then i'll go next door to qdoba.\u000a\u000a i've switched from steak bowels to steak salads because i do not need the extra carbs from the rice. the guacamole is delicious, but i don't get it that often because it's too expensive. other than that, this is one of my favorite places to go to when i don't feel like cooking!

Vwell, it's another chipotle like any other, except this one has a small parking lot behind it as well as on street parking which is usually available. my favorite thing about chipotle is the fact that they keep the menu extremely simple and use high-quality ingredients such as hormone/antibiotic free meats. try getting the soft tacos with corn tortillas which are available on request; they're much better that way. also, the bottled chipotle hot sauce is excellent on said tacos.

Vafter passing the billboard above this location countless times my family and i finally gave in and gave chipotle a try. after going over the menu for a few minutes we knew what we wanted. the menu is simple. \u000a\u000ayou choose from one of the following, either a burrito, burrito bowl, three crispy tacos, three soft tacos or a salad. for ingredients you can choose from the following:\u000a\u000agrilled chicken or grilled steak (both marinated in smoky chipotle chili adobo.), \u000a\u000abarbacoa (spicy, shredded beef, braised with chipotle chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, \u000aand cloves.) \u000a\u000acarnitas (pork braised with thyme, bay, juniper berries and cracked black pepper.) \u000a\u000afajita vegetables(bell peppers and sweet red onion sauted with fresh oregano.) \u000a\u000afour different salsas:\u000a\u000afresh tomato salsa (mild) (diced tomatoes with sweet red onions, jalapeos, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.\u000a\u000aroasted chili-corn salsa (medium) (sweet white corn, roasted poblano peppers, sweet red onions, jalapeo, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.)\u000a\u000atomatillo green chili salsa (medium) (fire-roasted tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapeo peppers, sweet red onion, cilantro, garlic, cumin and oregano.)\u000a\u000atomatillo-red chili salsa (hot) (chile de arbol, tomatillo, garlic, cumin and tabasco sauce.\u000a\u000apinto beans, black beans, cilantro lime rice, white cheddar and jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, sour cream . they also offer chips & guacamole and a kid's menu as well.\u000a\u000ai went with a steak burrito with black beans, fajita veges, roasted chili corn salsa, lettuce, cilantro lime rice and cheese. it was spectacular. my wife went with a barbacoa burrito and our daughter went with the steak tacos. they both loved their food as well.\u000a\u000ayes the line can be long at times but, it goes fast. there is also a small patio outside to enjoy the warm summer weather while it lasts.

Vi had dinner here for valentine's day which is perhaps not the best occasion to review a restaurant, so i'll be lenient. the dining room is very "cozy," and the table i was sitting at experienced an icy cold draft from outside which forced me to wear my coat  through dinner. the servers were not very attentive, but i'll assume that was because of the holiday rush.\u000a\u000aon the plus side, the menu had many interesting choices, and the quality of the food seemed decent. i think i was expecting the best thai food ever due to all the positive reviews, but i came away thinking it was no better than the other thai food i've had in pittsburgh. on the other hand, it wasn't really any worse either.\u000a\u000ato sum it up, since the north side is a bit of a drive for me, i probably won't be back, but if i lived in the neighborhood i would certainly give it another try.

Vi've been eating at nicky's thai kitchen for several years, and every time i go back they seem to have improved and they seem a whole lot busier.  it's getting to be a very popular place, and for good reason.  they serve excellent food at reasonable prices.  also, i absolutely love the patio garden in the back.  the decor and plants are beautiful.  i asked the staff who waters the plants, and they said they do the work and that it takes an hour to water everything.  regardless, i love the spring rolls, plus just about any dish on the menu is good.  i ordered a "7" on the 1 - 10 spice scale and my dish was definitely spicy enough.  the wait staff is attentive and helpful, and our food came quickly.  i had the chile mango scallops, and they were delicious.  i highly recommend nicky's.

Vhands down the best thai food we've had in pittsburgh. come during the summer, and sit outside in their back patio, which is like a little slice of thailand tucked away into a quiet pocket of pittsburgh. the service is very nice, and the food is wonderful. our favorites so far have been the mango tilapia (tilapia is usually just meh, but this is legitimately good!) and the pad see eu. the sticky mango rice is divine for dessert.\u000a\u000ai'm not sure how this place makes money during winter, because it doesn't seat a lot of people. so, i bet the line for this place can get long. but, come anyway! it's truly a great little gem.\u000a\u000anote - the thai ice tea is a bit on the watery side for us. but in no way did it deter us.

Vthis is another place i can't believe i haven't reviewed yet!!  this is kind of "our" thai place.  what really stands out about it is the decor--they have lots of authentic things hanging on the walls and around the restaurant, and an amazing patio.  it's really great.\u000a\u000aeverything i've ever had here is fantastic, but i usually order the pumpkin curry because it's just soooo good.  their soups are the best too, they come out in "hot pots" that are lit from below so they stay warm.\u000a\u000aalso, byob with no corkage fee--awesome.  this place is one of the best in the 'burgh!

Vi know it's christmas season, and i know that all stores are starting with their christmas tracks. some people love it, some people loathe it. i'm in the middle. i can appreciate good christmas music, but most of it is just too cheery and too cheesy. but, i brace myself every year after the huge turkey dinner digests for the holiday music season. i patiently wait through the month of december opting to play songs like the counting crows' long december - the best december song ever - and avoiding the radio. \u000a\u000awith all that, i complain about red hot & blue because yesterday, not only did they play the worst christmas music, they played the worst music tracks i could possibly imagine in a restaurant. they played this awful mix of bad bluesy/jazzy christmas music, jackson 5, alvin & the chipmunks, a bad remake of "my favorite things", and some other ear-bleeding music i didn't recognize. not only was the selection awful, they played it so loudly that i couldn't just tune it out. the waiter came over and asked "is everything okay?" to which i smart-assily said, "the food is good, but the music is definitely questionable." he chuckled and agreed, then walked away. i hoped that it would mean he would end the torture, but he didn't. \u000a\u000ai think the food was okay, not the best red hot & blue i've eaten, but it was acceptable. i don't love their bbq sauces, which is probably the most important part of bbq. the beef brisket had a little bit of fat on it, which i welcomed.  the fried okra side was my favorite part of the meal. other pros: our waiter was friendly and attentive (except the part where he doesn't turn off the music) and the water comes in this small pitcher, per person, which is the amount of water i typically need with dinner. \u000a\u000aperhaps i would have liked the food more if i wasn't trying to inhale it so quickly. who could blame me though, the music was an alternate form of torture. \u000a\u000anote to restaurants, the music you play does count for something. choose wisely.

Vi had lunch here today, it's located at the waterfront and is easily the 4th restaurant that has occupied the space.  it's right across the street from loews theater on the waterfront.  the place was relatively empty even though it was a friday during the holiday season.  i was the only one seated at the bar.  the bar is nice enough with a couple plasmas and appropriate amount of black and gold on the walls.  however, the bar itself was a bit sticky.  i was greeted quickly by a nice enough chap who brought me a paper and asked me for my drink order.  i had there iced tea, which was ackwardly served in a small pitcher instead of a glass.  i guess i could see the appeal for some, but i don't drink out of straws and this made it very difficult to drink without spilling.  the iced tea was pretty sickingly sweet.  i only had a few sips.  i ordered a cup of the chicken dumpling soup, which i thought was a bit overpriced.  the soup arrived quickly and had a decent flavor although it was served kind of room temperature and underseasoned. soup should be served steaming hot.  i also tried the pulled pork sandwich and collard greens.  the pork itself was okay, tender and all that.  however, it was also served relatively cold and underseasoned.  the collard greens looked good with big chunks of hamhocks, however not surprisingly they were served cold and also underseasoned.  the service overall was prompt and the hostess was very nice.  she asked how my food was and i didn't have the heart to tell her the truth.  i might give this place another shot.  i've been told the ribs were good, but i'll have to specify i prefer my meals served hot.  i'm guessing if i go again i should go quickly because i'm thinking this place may not be here much longer due to the lack of customers i saw today.

Vi'm a vegetarian, and the vegetarian hibachi/sushi combo just fails to impress.  largish portions, at least.  for hibachi, i don't know where else to go.  for sushi, both chaya and umi come immediately to mind.\u000a\u000afor a large group, it's hard to beat yokoso, though, as they have tables that will seat groups of 12-24.

Vgrody!\u000a\u000ai walked in and was overwhelmed by a really unpleasant smell, but i soldiered on.  then, while at the sushi bar, i see the sushi chef putting fake crab on my plate.  i immediately stopped him, confirmed the crab was fake, and got the hell out of there as fast as i could. no, no, no, no, no!

Va co-worker and i took a few clients out for lunch at yokoso. we were the first ones there, our server was sweet and the hibachi chef had a good sense of humor but i was expecting more pizzaz. the charm of a hibachi grill (at least to me) is the show put on for the guests. he showed off his knife skills and and made the little onion volcano but that was about it. i was expecting some real flare, but the food made up for it. we only ordered from the hibachi menu so i can't attest to the sushi, i ordered the veggies of course, which were all fresh and grilled perfectly and others ordered shrimp and chicken dishes. everyone was satisfied and had a great time.\u000a\u000ayou could ask, if everything was fresh and tasty then why only giive 3 stars. the answer would be because i've been to other hibachi grills where they put on a great, amazing show and give you more bang for buck.

Vchain hamburger joint.  wide selection of burgers done well, accompanied by a basket of "endless" fries, and any burger can be replaced with a boca patty for a vegetarian option.\u000a\u000aactually, really really good burgers.  on the minus side, service seems to be hit or miss, and you're looking at an $8 hamburger, plus drinks.

Vnot so much yummm.\u000a\u000abeen there twice, both times i was disappointed, actually the second time i was forced to go because i was outnumbered in a vote, but anyway. service is so-so, fries are disgusting,  jb said his burger was 'alright', my quesdilla was ok. i really wasn't expecting much from red robin but...\u000a\u000ai don't even feel like finishing this review because i have nothing good to say.

Vi'm a fan of this place, but something is lacking here.  like they left something decline here.  the service is so-so, and the food is sub par.  to me, it seems like they haven't cleaned off the grill or something.  evey thing seems to be filled with tons of grease now.\u000a\u000ai use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  that says something coming from a potato lover.  \u000a\u000ait's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change.\u000a\u000ai do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  but my burger was kind of blah.  i ordered the royal red robin and thought it'll be great.  i've had it before, and this time i was so underwhelmed i could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  the egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  i'm sure if i were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  the bacon was undercooked and so chewy that i pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag.\u000a\u000ai remember when the place first opened and i was one of their first customers.  it was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now i feel like this place has turned into chuck e cheese for adults...it's lost its luster.

Vthis is one of those places i can't believe i haven't been to in awhile.  to say nothing of writing a review on.  so last weekend aunt susan and uncle rick decided to take our niece and nephew here for an afternoon of history and culture.  they're at that age now when they can appreciate this sort of thing.\u000a\u000abut anyway this has to be one of the best museums i've ever been to.  it's a branch of the smithsonian and it's located in what was an old ice warehouse.  we were impressed by the main entrance, including the pittsburgh streetcar, which i remember used to run on the drake line (and my railfan husband really enjoyed).\u000a\u000abeing that we had the kids with us, we tried to keep it to just a couple of hours and to see the exhibits they would enjoy most.  so we went up to the "pittsburgh: a tradition of innovation" exhibit.  they really enjoyed the "america's first superhighway," in which you can take a virtual ride down the pennsylvania turnpike in an old jeep.  i personally liked the "crawford grill, which features influential jazz by george benson, billy strayhorn, stanley turrentine, and mary lou williams.\u000a\u000awe also liked the sports museum part, which celebrates luminaries like bill mazeroski, roberto clemente, and the greatest hockey player ever, mario lemiuex (with all due respects to wayne gretzky).  we also enjoyed "behind the scenes with the pittsburgh steelers", which explores their legendary teams (but if you want to see that, better hurry 'cos it'll be here only until february 10, 2010).  \u000a\u000aso pittsburgh has a great history of sports and innovations.   you can see them all here.  i have to return here with my girlfriends and spend the entire day here.

Vi learned so many things while i was here.  things such as: pittsburgh is so much more than meets the eye; who knew that all this happened here?; and that no matter what time you show up at this place, you will never have enough time to go through all the exhibits.\u000a\u000awe showed up with mixed expectations, not knowing what we would be in store for.  what we were in store for was a whole day of learning, that was fun.  depending on what you are really into history wise here kind of determines where you should start.  we went against the grain however and did whatever we wanted here and went to whatever exhibit with thought looked interesting to us at the time (what i should really say there is that we didn't follow the arrows posted throughout).\u000a\u000amy favorite part of this place is the section that takes you through pittsburgh in eras.  it was quite interesting.  you start from way back when up and past today.  it was awesome to see how pittsburgh looked throughout the years.  i was intrigued by the poptastic exhibit too, such vibrant colors, i loved it.\u000a\u000awe also stopped by the sports part of the museum.  who knew that bocce ball was such a big thing in pittsburgh?  i do now.  there are a lot of hands on things to do in this part of the museum as well, such as making your own medal, throwing footballs, computer touchscreens with information on it, and photo op spots.\u000a\u000athe gift shop here isn't too bad either.  lots of pittsburgh centric items to browse through.  they also have a pretty awesome book section.\u000a\u000adiscounts are available for certain groups upon admissions.  parking varies as there are many lots around here; however, don't go by their website prices.  we parked in the lot right next door and the price was actually more than what was listed online.  the hours are typical museum hours.\u000a\u000anot bad for my 500th review.

Vif you haven't been to the heinz history center, i urge you to go now! there is truly something for every sort of art, history, or sports lover. \u000ai could absolutely lose myself in the special collections which is filed with thousands of items that are so intriguing that you have stop, read about, and admire each and every single one.\u000a\u000athere is ample room to move throughout most of the museum though it is confusing to navigate at times. also, there are a lot of child friendly activities along the way so the kiddos don't get bored!\u000a\u000alarge parking lot across the street and walking distance to the strip!\u000a\u000abe sure to stop in the gift shop for all your pittsburgh centric needs. they've got andy, willie, rosie, and lincoln. you'll also find pickles and ketchup, pirates, pens and stillers.\u000a\u000aif you've got friends or family visiting from out of town or need a place to go on your next family night, or date night...whatever the reason, put heinz on your go-to list!!

Vi am writing about the history center as a venue for special events.  i have been to many performances, parties and special events here and the staff is really excellent and helpful.  they have lots of options in terms of space, and they bend over backwards to accommodate your needs.  the kinds of events hosted run the gamut from birthday parties, to weddings to concerts, and all of them are fun with the utmost professionalism.

Vomg! \u000a\u000athis place is delicious! ihop who?! the buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! the homemade syrup is as well. a short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. a short stack is more than enough for the average person.\u000a\u000athey give you a huge portion of corn beef harsh. it's pretty good but, not as good as pamela's.\u000a\u000atheir fresh squeezed orange juice is something special as well but at $4 a glass is pretty steep. i can buy a whole bottle of simply orange for that!\u000a\u000amy wife had a reuben and a cup of wedding soup. the wedding soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles. huh?\u000a\u000aa must try place! get there early as they close at 3 pm.

Vexcellent food you can write home about.  everything is savory and delicious.  it's a different experience than a breakfast place like pamela's, the food is very sophisticated and not too sweet.  i do like that i can go right to the counter and order my food, it seems to come a lot faster that way.  their pan potatoes are the best in the city.

Vthis is a great, no a grand location on grandview ave.  the view is amazing and it has one of the best decks in mt. washington and plenty of outdoor seating.  it is a must visit in the summer when you can view the beautiful pittsburgh vista in all its wonder.  i've been coming here for almost a decade and while i give the place much deserved kudos for a fantastic location and wonderful deck the food is another story.  i guess it's best to start with a little background the current incarnation is the "coal hill steakhouse" at the grandview saloon.  most regulars still refer to the place as the grandview for obvious reasons.  in all the years i've been a patron i don't think i've ever had dinner in one of the dining rooms.  the entrance has two sets of stairs, one leading downstairs to the bar and wonderful deck and the other two leading to two dining rooms upstairs.  the carpeting and general decor of the dining rooms is dated and the food used to be, well in a word... awful.  it's a little better now, but not close to what i would consider good food.  the owner is a surgeon who clearly uses this venue for tax purposes probably without a lot of consideration given necessarily to the quality of the product.  again, the view is great from all areas of the restaurant and this place does most of its business in the summer when folks appreciate the outdoor seating more.  the food has improved lately in its most recent incarnation as a "steakhouse".  let me back up,,, besides kudos for the view the staff is very corteous and friendly.  i had lunch here today and was the only visitor to the bar for the couple hours i was there and had a good conversation with rose who was working a very tame sunday shift.  charlie and dana are also excellent bartenders.  the bar seats about 15 with plenty of hightops and again lots of outdoor deck seating for the summer.  it has three huge plasmas with plenty of sporting options.  they maintain a decent wine menu and have plenty of beer options, including guiness on tap.  charlie and dana also make a reasonably good dirty martini.  if you are looking for a place that is not crowded on a sunday to watch football you could do a lot worse.  okay, now to the food.  i've ate here multiple times and never really had a good meal.  the steak prices are unreasonable i believe for the quality of the product and it's not possible to get a steak less than 14 oz. and $40 plus dollars unless you orderr a filet.  they offer the filet in a 6 oz. and 10 oz. option.  i still think the $30 plus pricetag is a bit much for the 6 oz. filet.  i think they say it's prime, but in my experience the steaks don't stack up to those of mortons or ruths.  today i ordered a cup of french onion soup, which was probably the highlight of the meal with a nice crouton, tasty broth, and plenty of melted guyerre (sp?) cheese.  i then ordered a cheesesteak sandwich and asparagus instead of fries.  the cheesesteak was a huge serving, but of relatively flavorless meat underseasoned on a stale non toasted bun.  the asparagus were tiny and had way too much salt.  if this place puts itself out as a prime steakhouse the asparagus should be much better and the steak should have some flavor.  they also charge an additional $3 for veggies instead of fries on top of the cost of the sandwich platter.  the view is 5 stars, service 4 stars and food 2 stars.

Vif you like desserts and baked goods, squirrel hill is easily pittsburgh's destination neighborhood.\u000a\u000athe decor of this place is really top notch, but that wasn't close to the best part, just the first thing i noticed walking in the door.  lots of space to sit down, and friendly staff.\u000a\u000ai tried the cupcakes, and i'd argue, hands down, that they had the best cake i've had in a bakery.  the icing is light and creamy, and mixes well with the awesome cake.  i'll be back soon.

Vas a part of mission cupcake crawl tasting, i've ventured outside of just dozen to satisfy my sweet tooth craving.\u000a\u000athis is the prettiest bakery i've ever been to with a small sitting area in the front. they have a wrap-around bakery display filled with delicious-looking cupcakes, cookies, and other sweets and you can also custom order cakes here. 5 stars for decor and presentation, we got 2 cupcakes after lunch and they were placed in individual little boxes with a see-through top and the box had a holder, so the cupcake wouldn't hit the walls.\u000a\u000athat said, the cupcakes were bad. we got a vanilla and red velvet. vanilla cupcake was stale, the icing a little too buttery for me and it had an odd thin hard crust around it. the red velvet cupcake was a complete disaster, the white frosting that looked so appealing in the window tasted almost identical to crisco lard :( the cake itself was ok but after having a bite of that frosting, i wanted nothing to do with that cupcake.

Vnot the best indian food i've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  a chicken tikka masala, an aloo mutter, and two orders of samosas came to a little more than $25.  the samosas were decent in size and flavor, as were the dipping sauces.  the aloo mutter was a little spicier and saucier than usual, and i thought they skimped on the rice a bit, but for $7 my expectations weren't too high.  the entree size was also big enough that i had tons of leftovers for the next day.\u000a\u000adelivery is available through campusfood.  i want to try the other indian delivery places as well, but i certainly wouldn't mind ordering from here again.

Vgreat place to store items for any amount of time.  i did my research first before deciding on this place.  i looked at rates, proximity, access and facilities.\u000a\u000arates here aren't bad, they all depend on the size of the unit you are looking for.  when looking for a spot, check online first, there are deals to be found if you reserve online.  after you reserve you should receive a phone call shortly after from the facility you booked with.  good thing here is they automatically bill you so you don't have to worry about another monthly bill.  \u000a\u000aproximity was good because it's right on one of the main drags in the city.  several different entrances so you can access it from almost anywhere.  \u000a\u000aaccess is a bit limited,  only during business hours.  so therefore if you can't make it before 6 p.m. on most nights, then you basically don't get in.  closed on all major holidays.  access keypad for when there is no one at the main desk so you can gain access to the building.\u000a\u000afacilities: this particular location is all indoors.  all units are located in an old warehouse building (or at least i think it is).  elevators for access to the higher floors with carts to help load your stuff for one trip up or down.  loading dock out back, the loading dock also has a ramp for easier access with items you just need to roll up there.  being indoors means this place is temperature controlled, no need to worry about moisture either.  they also have indoor loading docks in case the weather isn't cooperating.  pull in and unload without worrying about getting soaked or ruining your stuff.\u000a\u000a**other things to note about this place:  boxes, bags, locks, etc. are available for purchase in case you are in need of them.  the staff are super friendly and swift at what they do.  just like a lease on an apartment, give notice before you move everything out (at least two weeks notice).

Vthis place is incredible, i have to say. the pierogis(4 for $4) are stunningly good, the dough is so soft that it melts like butter in your mouth(or maybe that's just all of the butter, they give plenty!), and the insides are flavorful. these aren't your standard freezer pierogis, full of bland potato mush - whoever is making these has perfected their craft, and cares about every one.\u000a\u000ai've also tried a few other items, like the borscht... it wasn't my favorite, pretty lightly flavored, but that's ok, it wasn't bad, just not as hearty as i would like. the store is filled with funny polish novelty convenience store items, including chocolate bars and other knick-knacks. the back seating area takes up about half of the store.\u000a\u000ai do have one complaint about this place, and that's the wait. they have a poster that says you can get any pierogi filling with a 10 minute wait - or cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, or kraut+mushroom immediately, which to me implies that your wait when there is nobody else in the place would be less than 10 minutes. every time i'm in here, though, i'm waiting well over 10 minutes to get an order, so they should really try and cut down on the wait time.\u000a\u000aalso, like every other place in the strip, s&d is plagued by not being open long enough, so my only chance to enjoy is to try and make a bus trip on my lunch break or fight parking on the weekends - neither appealing, but i have taken both options to sink my teeth into these delicious pierogis

Vdid i eat here with mr. jones?  and did he strike up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer?  did we tell each other fairy tales?\u000a\u000amost importantly, did i eat here just so i could reference a counting crows song in my review?\u000a\u000anah!  \u000a\u000atruth is, i'd never even heard of this place before.  rick went to the movies with a buddy last night, so i came here with my friend elizabeth.  elizabeth's a lawrenceville babe and she recommended this place (don't look at me like that, melanie s. and mike o.).  no, really!  \u000a\u000athe food here is typical bar fare.  they've got a couple of items that caught my attention.  for appetizers, they've got caulifower nuggets.  isn't that just like an american bar to spoil perfectly good deep fried cheese by adding something healthy like cauliflower?  they've also got the "double yoi!!", which is grilled jumbo with egg-n-cheese on italian bread.  me, i went for the classic rueben on marble rye. elizabeth went for the guinness burger which looked decent.  i'm a non-drinker so i can't comment on the booze nor on the nightclub.\u000a\u000ai felt so symbolic yesterday eating here.

Vfertile hipster breeding ground saturday late-night! yeah, i had never heard any of the song snippets the multiple djs spun until the wee morning hours, but i had fun anyway. most hipster places have a surly feel, but i didn't get that from new amsterdam. the waitstaff was friendly, the door guys were really nice, and the bathroom is clean. the booze could be a bit cheaper, but what you gonna do? oh, plus, as i'm writing this review, i'm retrieving a hazy whiskey memory of a couple getting engaged while we were there. sweet!

Vfirst, you don't go here for the food.\u000a\u000athe waffle shop is strictly for intoxicated (or curious) individuals wandering out of the local bars. it doesn't open until late, the coffee is nothing to write home about, and the waffles are unexceptional.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, the atmosphere more than makes up for the mediocre food. the waffle shop is a media project run by cmu students, and you can volunteer to be interviewed up on stage, or you can watch others as they're picked apart.\u000a\u000agreat fun & inexpensive, to boot.

Vbefore i begin my review, i must ask the good people at murray avenue apothecary a good question. why are you not open on saturdays? the only day i can come here is on friday, either because i'm off work or i get done at 4pm instead of 5pm! so you lose a star for your hours. \u000a\u000ahaving said this, i've been coming to the murray avenue apothecary since my 20s for some of my diabetes medications, except for my insulin. murray avenue apothecary is a "compounding pharmacy". what is a "compounding pharmacy"? per the website, "a growing number of people have unique health needs that off-the-shelf prescription medicines cannot meet. for them, customized, compounded medications prescribed or ordered by licensed physicians or veterinarians and mixed safely by trained, licensed compounding pharmacists are the only way to better health." \u000a\u000abeing a type-1 diabetic, my medical needs sometimes differ from those of non-diabetics. generally, whenever i need medication that everyone else uses, like lipitor or cold or flu medications, i just go to rite-aid, cvs, or giant eagle. but when i need specialized medications, i come here. for example, recently my dentist prescribed chlorhexidine 0.2% oral rinse because he was concerned about plaque build-up. that rinse is a very effective one for diabetics to use. \u000a\u000ai have found that the staff here is very friendly and knowledgeable. they can answer any questions or concerns that you might have about your medication. they also sell a lot of non-prescription medications that you can't find at the chain pharmacies. \u000a\u000aif you are a pet owner, murray avenue apothecary has a lot of veterinary medications and veterinary care products that you cannot find anywhere else. you might want to check their website for the products and services they offer.

Vo' murray avenue apothecary!  you've been here all these years and yet you're still only open until 5pm on weekdays.  that 5th star would be all yours if only you kept later and/or saturday hours!  \u000a\u000aso being that on thursday i'll be traveling to washington, dc, i'll have to take an hour of annual leave tomorrow.  i have to pick up my prescription and take advantage of that anniversary on line coupon you're running until may 31.  \u000a\u000ayou also have wonderful skin care products from vital therapy, such as raspberry scrub (my favorite), vitamin c serum, and vital therapy apple delight cleanser.  \u000a\u000aon the other hand, your new on line prescription service makes ordering a breeze.

Vwhether you're a tourist or a resident, the absolute must-see is the edinburgh castle. the castle sits high atop a hill overlooking the city of edinburgh at the end of the royal mile. according to their website, there has been human settlement on the site since 900bc. but it's more than just an old castle. there are several museums within the grounds. \u000a\u000aonce you pass through the entrance, the first thing you'll notice is, besides the ticket machines, the gift shop. i guess they want to get you coming and going, but it is the largest one on site. besides the usual t-shirts, you can get clan histories and whiskey collections. once past this commercialism, you pass through portcullus gate. \u000a\u000abeing a castle, war plays an important part in its history. there are not one, but two war museums here. the national war museum looks at four centuries of scots at war. the scottish national war memorial is dedicated to the scots who died in both world wars. the prisoners of war exhibit shows how the castle was used for pows imprisoned and executed there. \u000a\u000ai think my favorite exhibits were the royal palace, the great hall, and the crown room. the royal palace was is where scotland's royalty lived when they were in edinburgh. believe me, it wasn't quite as "palatial" as the name implies. they preferred staying at holyrood abbey. the great hall dates from the 1500s and was used for state functions. when oliver cromwell invaded scotland, he had the hall converted into a barracks. it wasn't restored until the 1880s. \u000a\u000amy favorite though was the crown room. here you see scotland's crown jewels. i fell into a hush marvelling at the quiet beauty of it all. americans tend to think of anything made before 1990 as old. here we have the crown, sceptre and sword date from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. they had to be buried a few times. twice to hide them from oliver cromwell and once to hide them from the nazis. they remain in ceremonial use today with the crown being present at the opening of scottish parliament. \u000a\u000ayou can easily spend almost an entire day here. a few tips. it's steep here--wear your walking shoes. and i mean good, sturdy, ugly, comfortable walking shoes. be sure to watch the 1pm firing of the guns. also it's a good idea to buy your tickets on line like rick and i did. finally, take the guided tour. the guides here are very knowledgeable and the tour is included with your admission.

Vi guess i'm going to title my reviews "from pittsburgh to edinburgh".  i'm doing this review in our hotel's business center after a heavy morning of touring edinburgh.  i visited this zoo on july 2nd.  i was recuperating after an overnight flight from pittsburgh.  international flying takes a toll on my body, so while my husband was out sightseeing on his own, i took a day of rest & relaxation.  i felt better by the afternoon and strolled over to the zoo.  it's just down the block from our hotel.\u000a\u000ai'd rate this zoo somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars.  the thing to remember about this zoo is it's built on several levels.  if you use a wheelchair or a rascal (motorized scooter) or you're not a good walker, you may have trouble navigating around here.  the map http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/export/sites/default/common/documents/maps-and-guides/w_chair_zoo_map.pdf shows the many steep slopes and stairs here.  \u000a\u000aso since i've visited many zoos before (the national zoo in washington, dc; chicago's brookfield zoo and lincoln park zoo, pittsburgh's zoo, etc), what makes this one so different?  well for one thing, this zoo has a lot of educational talks and presentations.  i arrived in time for the penguin parade and talk and i also went to the indian rhinos talk.  yeah, i know it's a cliche, but penguins are funny little birds and it was hilarious watching them parade down the sidewalk.  \u000a\u000asome of the other attractions include the budongo trail, an interactive chimpanzee enclosure, and the only koalas in the united kingdom.  i think my two favorites however are the animal antics show and the rainbow landings where i got the chance interact with the rainbow lorikeet birds.\u000a\u000athe zoo was a perfect low key way to recuperate from jetlag. based on what sam c. says, i'm glad i ate lunch at the hotel.  just be sure to wear your walking shoes (you really don't want to be in flip-flops here!) and comfortable clothes.  and be prepared to do a lot of hill and stair climbing!

Vrick and i were looking for a unique tour of edinburgh.  boy did we find the right one.  he's a history teacher and he enjoys a good pint.  i'm a non-drinker because of my diabetes, but i am a true book lover.  \u000a\u000athe tour begins at the beehive inn, which is in the grassmarket, a favorite drinking venue for so many of scotland's favorite authors.  the two hosts are two fictional characters, clart and mcbrain.  the tour takes the form of an impassioned debate between them at the various taverns and 'howffs' in edinburgh's new and old towns.  they'll discuss three hundred years of scottish authors.  \u000a\u000ayou'll also visit the jolly judge (outside of which some of the most boisterous discussions of the tour take place), ensign ewart, and cafe royal.  along the way you'll meet sir walter scott, robert louis stevenson, robert burns, and robert ferguson.  the tour eventually makes its way to prince's street and the statue of sir walter scott.  \u000a\u000ai have to tell you this was one of the most fun and engaging tours i've ever taken.  i didn't catch the actors' names playing clart and mcbrain but i wouldn't be a bit surprised to see them on stage or screen.

Vi fell in love with penzey's in columbus and was pleased to find the pittsburgh location is well-stocked, fairly large, and has very friendly employees.\u000a\u000apenzey's is a national spice company with 40 stores and an excellent website.  every spice you could possibly want is here, reasonably priced, and available in a variety of sizes.  i started going here to get spices for indian dishes and just keep coming back.  they make their own spice blends, and a number of them are salt-free for anyone who is concerned about their blood pressure.  they have all their spices in little jars so you can smell them before buying, and as a result the whole store smells delicious.  they also sell a lot of different gift boxes - a perfect wedding or housewarming gift for a foodie friend.\u000a\u000atoday we got a huge jar of their hot chocolate mix, whole black peppercorns, a big bag of bay leaves, turmeric, cumin seeds, and coriander - total $20.26.  a lot of their spices come in bags so you can just refill the jars you already have - and their jars are very sturdy.\u000a\u000aif you like cooking or baking, definitely get yourself to penzey's.

Vyes, it's a chain.  but since there's virtually no competition on "spice shop", it's awesome all around.\u000a\u000athey have the freshest, best quality spices i've ever seen sold.  their mixed spices and marinades are great.  everything has a sample jar available so you can smell it.  \u000a\u000aonly gripe is that for some things - cumin, for example - the local ethnic food shops have it just as fresh, at 1/5th the cost.

Vi.  love.  penzeys.\u000a\u000apeople - once you shop here, you will never buy spices at a giant eagle again.  penzeys spices are:\u000a\u000a1. fresher.\u000a2. cheaper.\u000a3. unique-r.\u000a\u000atheir spices haven't been chilling out in a storeroom for weeks before you buy them.  the prices are waaaaay more fair - you easily pay twice or three times as much at another grocery store, for more poor quality.\u000a\u000aalso - their selection is unparalleled.  got a recipe with some bizarro spices in it?  where (you ask) will i find annatto seed?  herbes de provence?  fenugreek?  you will find it at penzeys.\u000a\u000athey also have great spice blends - just used their original taco seasoning last night to make enchiladas, and they had such a beautiful, authentic flavor.\u000a\u000ait's a don't-miss on the strip.  you can order online too, if you aren't able to make it in person!

Vkat and aaron did such a good job describing this place i don't know that i have too much to add.  i had lunch here today and even dealt with the craziness of the strip on a saturday because i wanted to try a new sushi place.  the atmosphere is very "yelpy",,, new word let's all start using it.  i'll defer to aaron's review for good detail on the space itself.  i walk up to the counter and order the sashimi lunch and also a couple fish tacos.  i placed my order and took a seat.  i'm guessing this place would be okay if you byob for a saturday lunch beer, but i didn't try it.  the fish tacos come out first and they have a great slaw with them and a delicious spicy sour cream type dip to put on the tacos.  the fish is grilled and not fried.  i actually prefer the fish to be lightly fried a la san diego style.  the taco is piled high with cabbage, cilantro and salsa.  it looks great.  i bite into the taco and sadly the fish is meh'.  it's a mix of overcooked less than fresh tasting salmon and tuna i'd guess.  i'm a bit surprised and a little disappointed.  then the sashimi arrives.  it's a big lunch portion with a really good variety of beautiful fish.  there are three nice sized pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, yellowtail and i think something else.  it's cut perfectly and is melt in your mouth delicious.  the wasabi and ginger are also spot on.  this is the best quality sushi i've had outside of umi in pittsburgh and it's a hell of a lot less.  it was only $9.50 for this large portion of beautiful fish.  just as a point of comparison i was at umi the other day and got maybe a tablespoon serving worth of fatty tuna for almost $20.  i will frequent here often for this good deal.  i'll chalk up the fish tacos to my fault for coming after the lunch rush when the fish had time to overheat.  the only other thing is that i'm not sure about the tip situation.  i mean the girl brought me my food, but that was about it.  i placed order at the counter and grabbed my own drink etc,,.  i noticed most didn't leave anything i left about 10 - 15%.  go for a cheap great quality sashimi lunch you won't be disappointed.

Vdecent sushi is so hard to come by in pittsburgh.  i guess that's what makes penn ave fish company just that much better!\u000a\u000abefore we ordered, we headed to the back of the restaurant to check out their fresh fish for sale.  they had a good assortment of fresh fishes, and shellfish as well as the most beautiful scallops i've seen in a while (but ran around $23 a pound... =/)\u000a\u000ai ended up ordering sashimi lunch platter and a scallop pizza to split.  the sashimi platter came with three pieces of salmon, four pieces of tuna, five pieces of fluke, three pieces of octopus and two pieces of crab.  the fish was some of the freshest fish i've had in pittsburgh.  the crab was forgettable, but all the other pieces were absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\u000a\u000aoriginally i was going to just get the sashimi platter and my companion was going to just have a maki combination, but we saw that lots of people were eating the scallop pizza so we decided to get one too!  the pizza was like a "white pizza" and came topped with sliced scallops, cheese, tomatoes as well as some rosemary.  the scallops were super tasty and brought an otherwise mediocre pizza to a whole new level.\u000a\u000ai really like how the staff is really cheerful as well as the incredible prices!  my sashimi platter with 15 pieces of sashimi (and two pieces of crab) was just under $10, my friend's maki combination was under $7, and the scallop pizza was also just under $10.  it was definitely more than enough to fill me up.

Vif you want the freshest and best sushi in the city, penn ave fish is the place to go.  the atmosphere is very casual, and you are very likely to see someone behind the counter in a shiny smock cutting up fish.  the hours are limited, but their new downtown location may help with that problem.  i have been to 2 special dinners there at the penn ave location, and both were over the top.  this place has the best sushi in town, hands down.

Vfive stars because i wanted to order literally everything on the menu.  there wasn't one thing i wouldn't have eaten.\u000a\u000asince it was lunch, i stuck with a p.a.f.c. salad topped with salmon, and, because i just couldn't resist it--a cup of boston clam chowder.  \u000a\u000adelicious, and so cool--they have all kinds of nautical art on the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  the menu is written/decorated on a chalk board, and you pay at the register when you're done eating.\u000a\u000ai can't wait to go back and try everything.  i'm looking forward to sushi here...but seriously, i will try everything. muahaha.

Vthis is probably jb's favorite place in the strip. every time he walks in, he gets a sample of something new and walks out with a pound or two of what he sampled. these guys definitely know what they're doing and they are passionate about their products. you'll find nothing but the best in quality and service here.\u000a\u000athe line to get in the front door often wraps around the block during the holiday season so be prepared for a long wait in cold weather.

Vit was my first time staying at a bed and breakfast, so i'm not sure how it compares to other ones but everything was great! the house was built in 1870's and has been kept in pristine condition - it definitely sets the atmosphere and mood for the place. each room has its' own "theme", i stayed in chenille with a huge tub and an antique sink, the shower was alright - very low water pressure and took forever to warm up.\u000a\u000aed runs parador along with two friendly dogs (that don't go past the kitchen, so no biggie if you're allergic). he's very hospitable and told me a few bits about the city and it's history in the morning. breakfast was good - coffee, oj, banana bread and yogurt parfait, and a whole-wheat veggie egg wrap served with bacon, sour cream and bean/salsa thing. i'd highly recommend this b&b to anyone visiting.

Vthis is a good local chain with about 7 locations.  i believe this is the first one and i used to stop here more often when i kept an office in the area.  i was there last week with some guys i used to work with and since we were getting the "band back together" we decided to hit up this south hills institution because we were an institution of sorts years ago.  we got there at about 930 pm last tuesday.  this is an immediate plus because many non major chain restaurants don't serve food past 9 or 10 pm during the weekdays in the burbs'.  the kitchen is open here until 11 pm.  the space itself is pretty cool.  it very much has a local watering hole feel to it.  they have valets that work during the dinner rush to park your car promptly with a smile.  in the summer they have a patio area that is perfect for al fresco dining.  the interior itself is homely with dark wood, moderate lighting and the decorations on the walls are authentic and not the mass produced types at tj mcfunsters.  there is seating in both upstairs and downstairs and it is cozy while still providing privace from the table next to you.  on tuesday we all sat at the bar and there was a pretty packed bar (surprising on a winter tuesday for most places, but i'd guess not this place), but all 5 of us were able to eventually get a seat.  the patrons were young and old, suits and jeans and for the most part friendly even though it was clear initially we weren't part of the usual clique'.  the food is nothing spectacular, but it is solid 3 star dining a step above olive garden and casual chain and not quite fine dining.   they had guiness on tap with always warms my heart.  the wine selection was decent and reasonably priced.  i was able to get a couple pours of a decent red malbec for under $10 per glass.  my buddies were able to find a few okay scotches to choose from and i think they had glenlivet and glenfiddich i think up to 24 yr. old.  the bartender, sarah i believe was very good, attentive and friendly.  this is the kind of bartender that makes it easy to grab a burger and a beer by yourself at a bar.  i started with a cup of the sherry crab bisque, which was a lot better than the last i had here.  it was thick and creamy without being too thick.  it also had noticeable chunks of crab.  i then had the chedder burger which was a big burger on a warm perfectly toasted bun oozing with cheese, however i wasn't asked how i would like it prepared so it was a little overcooked for my tastes.   i substituted asparagus for fries for $.50 more.  the asparagus were tiny and not that good, but i guess it's not the season.  mike had the seared ahi tuna which was pretty good and better quality than i would have expected.  i think trevor, lloyd and rob literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu.  i tried one of the caribbean shrimp which was a pretty good not overcooked large shrimp with tasty coconut breading.  they also had the mini burgers, pot roast nachos (pretty good i'd suggest trying), fromage dip (forgettable) and a few other things.  all in all a good neighborhood place that is a local franchise and worth your time if you are looking for an alternative to the mega chains.

Vthe food was really good... in my opinion, better than the fox  chapel location.\u000a\u000athe decor is a little hokey, but i guess local sports paraphernalia is better then random rummage sale finds (a la crapplebee's and tgifridays).\u000a\u000abonus points for seasonal specials and free valet... free does not mean that tips are not accepted, please remember those fellas are doing you a huge favor by not making you go insane from attempting to find a parking spot yourself... reward them.\u000a\u000aservice was friendly and attentive but not overly so.

Vvery little selection on the lunch buffet, and $10 is twice the price of sree's on smithfield, which has about the same amount of variety.  just was disappointed, as friends claimed this was the place to go.\u000a\u000ataste of india in bloomfield or india garden in oakland still win the buffet war.

Vi often eat at indian spices before a play or the symphony.  they have reliably quick service and deliciously authentic indian food.  i particularly like their coconut soup, which i think is quite unique.  their breads are wonderful, and so are the entrees.  the wait staff is quite friendly and helpful.  i really enjoy eating at indian spices and i never hesitate recommending it to others.

Vthe food here is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable, especially for downtown.  if you haven't tried their coconut soup, it's rather unique and delicious.  this is one of my go-to spots for dining downtown.  their service is fast and you can't beat their location.  it's a family business and the wait staff are very friendly, funny, and incredibly nice.  their naan is excellent and authentic.

Vthe greek gourmet is the go-to place for hummus.  forget trader joe's, forget whole foods, definitely forget giant eagle.  all their hummus is made in-house (yes apparently there's a difference between something made in-house and something that's housemade; housemade can be made in someone else's house).  they have their hummus out for you to try before you buy it.  apparently they also are one of the sources of hummus for whole food's, as they were out of their smoked white bean hummus the last time i went (its absolutely delicious and the smokiness reminds me of a summertime cookout).\u000a\u000amost of their pastries are made in-house; their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are shipped in though.\u000a\u000athey also have other things like pastas and olive oils and what not, but i'm always drooling over their prepared foods to notice anything else.

Vsatiates all of my mediterranean cravings from hummus and olives to pastries. as previous reviews have mentioned, it is a bit more expensive but you know how the saying goes, "you get what you pay for". \u000a\u000apaying more is definitely worth it when the quality of the product is superlative.

Vnote: i've only been a patron for lunch; i'll update my review after i visit for dinner.\u000a\u000awe ended up heading over to sausalido for lunch since it's always been on my list of restaurants to try and i was in the mood to enjoy a full meal instead of the quick drop-in for takeout or a sandwich.\u000a\u000aupon arriving, we noticed we were the only patrons of the restaurant at the time (around 12:45 pm).  yes it was a bit unexpected, but it meant we got the full attention of the waitress and we could be seated anywhere we liked.  while we looked over the menu, she brought out a bread plate with a white bean dip drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and topped with red peppers.  the dip was delicious and we had no problem finishing everything.  later she brought out three freshly made bowls of seafood chowder, compliments of the chef.  she noted with a laugh, "one the perks of being the only customers right now."  the seafood chowder was chock-full of fish, scallops, mussels, and shrimp.  the base of the soup itself was flavorful and light, not like traditional chowders bogged down with heavy cream.  my two companions decided to start out with two more cups of the seafood chowder while i opted for their capon and ditalini soup, a chicken noodle soup offered every day.  my soup is freshly prepared with their house chicken stock with wilted spinach and topped with cheese.  i preferred the seafood chowder, but i have to note that the chicken stock had multiple layers and many subtle flavors.\u000a\u000afor our entrees i ordered their gnocci, and my companions ordered their crab cakes and their flank steak.  my gnocci is advertised as "house made", but realistically it was brought in from elsewhere.  it was served with braised lamb in a tomato ragout and topped fish fresh basil and freshly grated cheese.  the flavors were all there, but i like my gnocci with a bit more of a bite to it.  the braised lamb was a bit tough and ended up detracting from the dish as opposed to improving it.  the crab cakes were pretty good, but would've been slightly more epic if the lump meat was a bit larger.  it's a pretty small portion, so do make sure you order a soup to go along with it.  the flank steak was served medium rare topped with a horseradish creme fraiche with smashed potatoes.  the steak was excellent; cooked well and flavorful from being marinated and seasoned properly.  the smashed potatoes were a bit too cheesy for my liking, but i like how smashed potatoes have lots of textures going on with mild lumps of potato and potato skin in the mix.\u000a\u000asausalido is byob, so you can bring your own bottle and you definitely should ($2 corkage fee per person).  lots of entrees from the lunch menu have encore presentations on the dinner menu; however, there are new dishes as well such as a duck breast, scallops, and a pork chop.\u000a\u000athere aren't too many seats in the restaurant, so for dinner i'd recommend calling ahead for reservations just to be on the safe side.

Vnice little coffee shop on penn in friendship. free wifi, wide variety of indoor seating options & some outdoor as well. my soy cappuccino was good - on a par with those from other leading shops in the burgh. carrot cake muffin was tasty & still hot although somewhat raw in the middle.

Vcute, quiet coffee house on penn ave. the atmosphere is pretty relaxed, and there's good indie music playing over a small set of speakers to keep some ambient noise without being distracting. the coffee selection is nicely edited, and the coffee is delicious. these hipster hippies know their coffee ;) i'm not sure that they have different sizes of most of their drinks, which is fine with me because i think it's weird to get 16oz of some coffee concoction. my cappuccino was a reasonable size, was carefully made, and tasted fantastic!

Vcame here as the end point for the east end brewery's yearly beer biking event. can't comment on the food or beer here since i only had east end beer, but the bar seemed clean and friendly. it also appeared to be smoke free, but the night i was there was slightly unusual. interesting dcor with bikes hanging from the ceiling; i'll definitely come back here on a more normal night.

Vwe came here last night to spend our groupon.  we found a table right away at 7pm on a friday.  you could definitely tell the bar was truly a place for the biking community.  they go beyond just having "bike decor," this is a place for enthusiasts to meet.  there were perhaps 8-10 bikes parked outside on a freezing january day, if that says anything!\u000a\u000awe started with beer - i asked for anything like a wheat beer, which the server said they did not have on tap.  then i asked for whatever their lightest brew might be, which she reported was oskar blues dale pale ale (i think beer changes seasonally).  when i got the beer, i was disappointed that it was their lightest selection out of at least six drafts.  it was certainly brown in color, not the golden yellow that signifies the beers i prefer.  my boyfriend got the same beer and really enjoyed it - i thought it was okay, but too hoppy for my taste.  seems like it might be nice if they had a little more variety in their draft selections - anything light for people like me?\u000a\u000aour table was right next to the jukebox, but we were still able to hear each other over the music.  there was a steady flow of individuals choosing rock songs throughout the night, and tvs situated around the room.  the lights were very dim and i did strain a bit to read the menu (apparently i'm old now), but i ended up settling on the dirt rag delight, while my boyfriend got the thick chix.  it didn't take long for our food to arrive.  my burger was cooked to a medium-rare as a requested, and the bun was sturdy and held its shape - not the little soggy things you sometimes get.  my burger came with cheese, peanut butter and pickles, which sounded so bizarre i couldn't resist.  amazingly, the combination really worked for me.  it's a hilarious sensation, getting peanut butter stuck to the roof of your mouth when you eat a burger.  out of the two burgers i've had in pittsburgh, it was my favorite, but i'd say it was just "pretty good" as opposed to "great."  and i had asked for bacon which did not come on the burger, sadly.  the server reported she had put the order in with bacon and the kitchen just messed up.  i believe her, but it was still a bummer - but the burger was fine without it so i asked her not to bother getting some.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend, on the other hand, was less wowed by his chicken sandwich.  it sounded incredibly flavorful - chicken with barbecue sauce, onion rings, bacon - how could that not be a major party in your mouth?  when he and i traded sandwiches, i was really floored...with disappointment.  i kid not, somehow it was bland.  bland!  i can't figure it out!  i think they might've just needed more of everything - there wasn't a whole lot of "stuff" between the buns.  it was supremely underwhelming.  fortunately the fries were hot, thick, and crispy (but in need of salt).  i had to take some of my burger home, but my boyfriend begrudgingly ate his sandwich, too hungry not to do so.\u000a\u000atwo beers and the two sandwiches came to about $24.  reasonable prices on everything - especially the beer - but it seems like the food, in our case, was hit or miss.\u000a\u000aboyfriend wants to give them another chance, since he liked the atmosphere and he thought it'd be fun to ride our bikes down here sometime.  in spring, presumably.  i'd be okay with that, and i bet if i have been biking a few miles, i'll be so hungry that i won't care if some of the food is good, some is okay, and some is not-so-good.  i'll just need fuel.  and otb can definitely provide that.

Vif you are craving real food, real old school burgers, i recommend the otb cafe.  i have found the wait staff to be very good and the food quite delicious and satisfying.  there's nothing at otb that feels like a chain.  personally, there are way too many tv screens, and i find that distracting.  the decor is quirky and fun and i like the bicycle theme.  i also like that i can visit this place while biking and not feel awkward about my helmet and other gear.  this is a fun place to meet other outdoor enthuisiasts.

Votb is a bar that i really want to like, their menu has interesting items on it(seitan parm? burgers with peanut butter?), the atmosphere is cool, and the specials are great(burgers, tacos, beer, etc)... why can't this place just keep its stuff together to really make it shine?\u000a\u000ai'll start with the positives: the food is good and well priced. on a monday we went and grabbed two veggie burgers($5/ea): the bicycle advocate and the pedal pittsburgher. they don't come with fries on a monday but no big, we split a side since they were only $2. the burgers came dripping in their respective sauces making them hard to eat, but giving us plenty to dip our fries in. the buffalo mozzarella, sauteed spinach, and sriracha ranch all went perfectly with each other. my girlfriend also loved her burger, and while we originally intended on going halfsies, we both agreed we liked the ones we got and stuck with them.\u000a\u000athe beer was cheap too, they have $2 pbr pounders all day, and usually another bottle that is either $2(like monday's yuengling) or a few dollars off($3 off east end, $2 off oskar blues)\u000a\u000ai wish i could stop there on my review, but i have to reiterate what other people on here have said: the service leaves to be desired, as it was quite slow. i understand that this is a dive bar, the kitchen is sure to be small, and the place was by no means slow, but does it really take an hour and a half to make pre-cooked(boca) burgers? beyond that, in the 2 and a halfish hours we were there, we got checked on(including getting our check and getting our food) about 5 times. \u000a\u000aanother point, good and bad, is that monday is also trivia night at 9pm(burgers and trivia on the same night? awesome!) so we also came out for that. however, in the back portion of the bar, it is almost impossible to hear, so us(and a few other tables) wound up running up to the bar to hear ever question. the trivia is pretty well run, though - they have you take your answers up each time and keep a running total as opposed to taking a half hour or more to tally everyone's up(brillobox...). the questions were ok, though the music between questions was not.\u000a\u000aotb has a lot of specials that are definitely going to keep me coming back.. to me, slow service at a dive bar is to be expected and nobody was rude, so i can't hold it against them - but it does prevent them from being a pittsburgh destination(unless you're a bike-fanatic). i will update the review if i have to, to reflect any changes(maybe on $.25 seitan wing wednesdays!) in service to hopefully give them a higher rating. in my opinion if you cross this place off your list due to warnings of bad service then you're going to miss out, just come with some good friends and time to kill.\u000a\u000aalso - obviously, biking here is optimal to avoid parking, but depending on the time of day you can avoid the meters that run until 10pm by going a block off carson to sarah street or another side street.

Vcyclist or not, veggie or not, this is a great place to meet some friends, have a brew, and munch on some scrumptious apps.  the servers have been inviting and friendly the couple of times that i've been to otb. i've sampled the fried pickles which were pretty standard and i've ordered the beer cheese soup and seitan wings with "lickers" sauce. haven't had a bad thing yet...unless you want to include my mini sized bloody mary that had no vodka in it or garnish. hey, sometimes beggars can not be choosers so im willing to overlook that. they have rotating microbrews on tap that make up for it.

Vmore like 3.5 stars, and we will discuss why that is.  showed up here for a trivia night with friends.  the atmosphere in here is great.  everything feels so alive and vibrant.  everyone laughing, having a good time.  not a good thing when you come to battle royale in trivia.  makes it hard to hear the questions being asked.  i think to make it more interesting, they should make you were earmuffs, just to up the difficulty.\u000a\u000aservice wise they are amazing.  we sat down at the table to meet our friends and we didn't even have to get comfortable before a waitress was in front of us with menus and asking what we would like to drink.  when our drinks came back to the table i had a question about the menu and she was on point with the answer.  my decision was made.\u000a\u000abeing that i just ate before coming here, i only opted for an appetizer.  i selected the fried pickles with a peanut butter dipping sauce.  it took a few minutes for it to be prepared.  which was truly surprising to me.  why?  well let me tell you why.  when my pickles showed up, they looked..."normal."  i tried the peanut butter dipping sauce first to see how i would like it, it wasn't for me, so i asked for ranch instead.  i then proceeded to pick up my pickles with extra care, you know, they looked fresh out of the grease.  i didn't want to burn myself.  but that was a lie.  they were freezing cold in the middle...and crispy on the outside.  i mean how do you even do that?  deep fry something and it still comes out partially frozen.  i thought i was imagining things until my friends confirmed it for me that they were indeed still cold.  when the waitress came back i informed her of this and said that i wasn't going to eat these.  within moments the cook had another set of pickles in the fryer and this time they came out perfect.  so perfect i burnt the roof of my mouth because the anticipation was killing me.\u000a\u000ai will give this place another chance, but probably during the early evening to try other items on the menu.  and maybe when it's not so crowded just yet.

Vtoo bad this is the only location in pittsburgh and is kind of inconvenient to get to. it's also not a fully fledged store, but they seemed to have most of what i'd expect. strangely, they use paper cups here instead of styrofoam ones.

Vexcellent location, especially if you are headed to a hockey game.  the food is okay.  not a favorite place of mine, but it can sometimes come in handy.  the restaurant is owned by duquesne university and it is managed by foodservice giant aramark, so it's no wonder this place often reminds me of a college cafeteria.

Vsurly order takers that seem pissed that you are there; give a loud audible sigh when you ask is there a substitute for chips on my sandwich. while a manager with a scowl on her face oversees the whole process. yeah that's an inviting experience.\u000a\u000athen you buzzer goes off and food that is haphazardly put together is slung into the window so your sandwich is flies apart. once you reassemble the mess it tastes pretty good and they have good ice tea but its north worth the hassle and nasty attitudes of the employees there.\u000a\u000abtw, the internet was out that day and when i asked about it the response was "it's working fine, you are probably not doing something right." yup me and everyone else in the joint, back at our table i made a comment about the help and the person next to us agreed they also told me they have a constant problem with the internet in that store.\u000a\u000askip this location - 1 star for the most atrocious and unfriendly attitudes i have had in a food service establishment in a long, long time.

Vsuper swanky and very chill.\u000a\u000agreat for date night or a gathering of friends.\u000a\u000aservice was slow, but to be fair, there was only 1 bartender and we had such a great time it really didn't matter.\u000a\u000aall cocktails $10 and $15 for absinthe.\u000a\u000ai went with a party of 6 and we had a little tasting party. everything was delish (except for the old fashioned, but that's just not my glass of whiskey) and my absinthe didn't win anyone over, but i enjoyed it.

Vdude how could i not be a fan when my first experience with this place is that they hand me a gigantic, free chicken burrito??  i hope that they get some spillover traffic from the subway next door, because i can tell the locals that own the franchise are workin' hard and i don't want them to get eaten by economy like so many other local businesses (i.e., papa george, sweet indulgence, pages for all ages)

Vlou's has all the elements (and more) of your local, dive bar:\u000a- it looks sketchy from the outside; you're not sure whether to go in or run away when you first approach the building\u000a- it smells like smoke\u000a- the bartender knows many of the patrons by their first names and vice versa.\u000a- cheap beers that get refilled regularly, for cheap.\u000a- entertainment: a dart board and pool table. (of course you gotta pay)\u000a- scary bathrooms\u000a- a mixed crowd, most of whom are extremely comfortable being there.\u000a- a bat behind the bar that the bartender uses to chase off people as he sees fit.\u000a\u000abasically, it's filled with the good and bad, and if the good outweighs the bad, you keep going and become one of the guys (or gals).\u000a\u000ai can't say i recommend or don't recommend it. you know what you can handle and what you're looking for. i just laid it out there.

Va neat little sandwich shop in downtown.  blink and ya miss it.  they specialize in 8" subs.  they're a little too much for me to eat at one sitting, so i'll either split one or save half of it for later.  most of the sandwiches have some pretty cool names:  the old geezer, the cajun cow, or the dirty bird.  my favorite is the greek bird:  chicken and cucumber sauce.\u000a\u000afadz offers typical salads here too like the greek salad, the house salad or the steak salad.  they have sides here too inluding fries and onion rings, but really these sandwiches are big enough on their own.

Vy'know, fadz is a solid three-star performer when it comes to a good sandwich.  it's not the pinnacle of fine dining but you'll certainly leave satisfied.  they pretty much do one thing and do it well--sandwiches.  i went here with a co-worker of mine and as these sandwiches are big, we split a phoenix which is chicken and provolone and an order of onion rings.  \u000a\u000ai was almost bold enough to try the ragin' cajun chicken sandwich, but my friend wanted something a little more mild.  it's just as well--eat of the ragin cajuns too fast and you'll be able to see through time!

Vfadz, i love you for how you now have fadz gear available on your website http://www.cafepress.com/fadz !  hats, mens' and womens' t-shirts, novelties, and office stuff!  you mean now i can pay you for the privilige of advertising your business?  whoo hoo!  \u000a\u000aokay fadz, my little joke aside (and rest assured i meant it with love--some of your gear looks pretty good), your subs are still pretty good and well worth a 3 1/2 star rating.  i came here for lunch yesterday and got the triple play--pastrami, turkey, and swiss cheese.  mmmmm!

Vit's a pub, but it's faux-irish.  they had english vinegar on the tables, jameson sitting next to bushmills, and turned off the rugby game to watch a hockey interview show.\u000a\u000athe fish and chips had half the fish being awful chewy, the beef stew was authentic enough to be incredibly bland, and the darker beers we ordered tasted awful watery.\u000a\u000aif you want strip-mall-irish, it might be the best pittsburgh has to offer; we're thin on chains around here.  fado does it better, if you've been to one of those.  \u000a\u000atry mullaney's in the strip if you want more authentic irish.  hell, go down to piper's british pub and try the boxty.

Vi typically try not to review chains, but we had such a silly experience here on sunday.  we stopped by prior to seeing a movie.  i'm sure most of their business is due to the convenience of the location.  i've probably been here a dozen times and it's what you'd expect from a chain "faux" irish pub.  the restaurant itself is actually quite attractive.  there are high ceilings, plenty of seating (tables, hi-tops and booths) and a good looking dark wood bar with plenty of brass scattered about.  the food is again what you'd expect...think whatever tg mcfunsters comes to mind and then add a cabbage dish or too.  so, why the reason for me to review this chain?  we grab a seat at the bar and are greeted by a very nice young bartender.  i think her name is mckenzie.  i order a guinness, since the place literally is like one big commercial for this storied brew.  i mean literally there is no where you can look including the ceiling without seeing some type of guinness paraphernalia.  she sheepishly tells me they are out of guinness.  it's clear she's embarrassed, however as shocking as this is i most likely wouldn't have taken the time to document this if for just that problem.  they are also out of bass and harp??  okay, fine let's just order something to eat.  i get the fish sandwich (which was pretty good actually, especially the fries). annie orders the "loaded" fries, but with only cheese and bacon on it.  she specifically asks for no tomatoes.  the first order comes up and mckenzie notices the tomatoes and doesn't even bring it to us.  then they make the same mistake again and put tomatoes on the darn thing, this time mckenzie brings it over and basically says they can't seem to do this difficult task, so we skip the fries.  finally, we are about to leave and i'm paying the bill when i notice they put someone else's' drinks' on my tab.  okay, let's recap.  irish pub out of guinness, harp and bass.  they mess up a food order not once, but twice.  finally, they overcharge me for someone else's drinks.  i still tipped the bartender 20%+, because clearly she was embarrassed and most of these mistakes were not her fault.  however, i think this place must be severely mismanaged.  almost every experience that the back of the house was in charge of was poorly executed.  hopefully, they'll get their act together.

Vnot very veggie friendly but their beer selection is pretty decent and you can mix 'n match ales (woodchuck amber + hoegarrden = deliciousness). i haven't been here for a couple months but i just reviewed the menu online and it looks like they have some new additions that are vegetarian (the chilled summer pasta and cornucopia sliders sounds pretty awesome). \u000a\u000athe bf is irish and german so give the man some meat and potatoes and he's a happy lad. needless to say, he's never had a complaint. \u000a\u000acladdagh never really seems to be busy, then again we stay far far away from the south side on weekends. service has always been good, so yeah - no complaints here. give it a try if you're at the s.s.works

Vwe had some gift cards to claddagh, and since they don't have this chain in chi-city, we thought we'd better use it up before we skip town.\u000a\u000awe rolled in on a friday night at 6 pm and were seated right away.  some live music began around 7 pm - you can check the website, they tell you who's playing.  it can get loud, so definitely check the schedule if noise bothers you (or alternately, if you love live music and what to know what to expect).  our server was incredibly (possibly overly attentive), checking on us approximately every 5-10 minutes during our hourlong stay.  taking drink orders, checking on how we liked our drinks, taking food orders, seeing how we liked our food, boxing up my food, checking on my boyfriend's food progress (i eat much more slowly than him), boxing up his food, etc.  she checked in a lot.  it actually got moderately annoying, but at least she didn't ignore us!  it's a hard balance to strike.\u000a\u000aanyhoo, we got beer/hard cider (strongbow on tap ftw) and then i got the chicken pot pie with a side of green beans, and my boyfriend got the shepherd's pie with a side of mac 'n' cheese.  it should be noted that they do have a "pie night" during the week - i forget which night - where pie dinners are buy one get one free (or maybe not free, but only for $2 or something).  one of the many times our server stopped by was exclusively to tell us about this pie night.  so it's fixed in my memory.  if you like dinner pie - that is your night.\u000a\u000athe food was pretty "okay" across the board.  generic/average versions of pub favorites.  it's always a bit of a letdown because the menu items sound so delish and then it's like "this food is just pretty okay."  the pot pie was savory and hot with big pieces of chicken and veg, but it didn't have a crust - it had like...a crumbly topping.  like a dessert.  only it was a bread crumb/cheese topping.  which was not my fave - i prefer a true crust on my pot pie.  is it really a pie without a crust?  deep thoughts.  side of green beans was well cooked, but of course served in butter.  definitely not worth $3, but all restaurant sides are overpriced.  \u000a\u000amy boyfriend's shepherd's pie was okay as well - it seemed to have ground beef in it instead of big beefy chunks, but it was savory, served very hot, and had the appropriate mashed potato top.  both portions were a good amount of food for the price.  the mac 'n' cheese side came in a little cup.  the texture was rockin' (sooo creamy) but it was missing something in the flava department.  like - they need to pick better cheese, or add salt, or paprika, or onion/garlic....or anything?  it was lacking.\u000a\u000aahhhhh i feel so bad giving this 2 stars but i am becoming more cruel on yelp these days!  what can i say?  i give something three stars when it's fine and i'd be happy to pop in again if i needed a meal.  2 stars is for places where i don't really feel the need to go back again...and claddagh really is one of them.   the food is fine for a chain, but it's really subpar versions of amazing irish dishes that should be slammin'.  i'm so mean.  or am i just so honest?  hitting you up with the truth, that's how i roll.  meet me in chicago and we'll go to a better irish pub.\u000a\u000abut for what it's worth, my boyfriend said he'd give it three stars instead of two, and i think it'd be a fun place to have drinks at the bar and listen to music.  and maybe have an appetizer if you're drunk.  but i'd skip it for dinner!

Vsorry, but this place isn't all that.  yes, proceeds do go to something nice, but it's still a thrift store.\u000a\u000ait's kind of dirty when you walk in, and has the smell of old (should be expected, just like goodwill).  i have yet to find anything that could be of use to me in here.  with the awesome sign out front you would think the inside would be more well put together.\u000a\u000ago to a goodwill, salvation army or red white & blue before here.  honestly, it's like all the free t-shirts you get from attending an event ended up here.

Vsimpatico espresso may be a little out of my way, but i'd been wanting to try it for the longest.  it's a little hard to find , located in the old alcoa building, but it's worth checking out.  \u000a\u000ai must say i'm normally a "brewed coffee of the day"--black-- kind of girl.  see that way the caffeine gets into my system quicker.  but since i was in the area i thought i'd try something just a little out of the norm for me.  i went for their cafe au lait--i know, i know:  i live in the fast lane--which was just out of this world.  great pick me up for the blah day i was having.\u000a\u000asimpatico also has bulk coffee available and if i'm down this way again, i'm gonna try some.  \u000a\u000aplease patronize this gem folks.

Vi've been consistently impressed with the fresh healthy salads, panini, pizza, and soup. fresh ingredients, nice flavors, and they also have beer and wine. as an added perk, special bins for recycling and composting. this is one of the best places to get a salad in oakland.

Vmom and i hadn't had a girls' day out in awhile so we thought we'd hit the phipps conservatory and then head over to the carnegie library for a free jazz program.  \u000a\u000acafe phipps is a neat little dining area near the front of the conservatory.  they specialize in locally grown and organic foods.  their menu is a bit limited, but that's okay.  makes for an easier decision!  forgoing my usual wrap or 1/2 pannini and soup, i went for the lemon shrimp nicoise which was basically grilled lemon shrimp, bacon, and a whole bunch of salady greens in there.  it's gotta be healthy!  \u000a\u000acoffee here is excellent too.  oh and they have desserts from prantl's bakery!  mmmmm!  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!

Vwith the menfolk out for a day at the pennsylvania trolley museum, my mom, my sister-in-law, my niece and i decided to have a girls' day out at phipps conservatory.   cafe phipps has a seasonal sunday brunch that runs until the first weekend in january.  \u000a\u000acafe phipps has a lot of your standard buffet brunch items on the menu.  you've got your omelets, crepes, carved meats, desserts, etc.  the thing about cafe phipps is they use as many locally sourced ingredients as possible.  so their food is always very fresh.  i'm not one for omelets, but their crepes are to die for and the bread pudding was out of this world.  yep, you know the drill by now.  pump that insulin, susan!  pump!  \u000a\u000aso while the boys were off drooling over things with rails, the girls and i had a wonderful brunch.

Vmaybe it's the jet lag, maybe it's because neither mom nor i liked what we ordered. but i've gotta dock cafe phipps a star. \u000a\u000amy husband rick and i had been away for a week in hong kong and my mom wanted to take me out to lunch when i returned.   shame mom and i normally love cafe phipps, and since mom has a membership at the phipps conservatory, she comes here a lot.\u000a\u000aanyway, mom ordered the turkey meatball sub with a side of citrus coleslaw and she didn't like it one bit.  i think my mom forgot that she just doesn't like turkey meatballs, turkey sausages, turkey bacon, etc.  as for me, i went for the grilled vegetable wrap which was decent but wildly unspectacular.  and i should have ordered a side of that citrus coleslaw.  but nope, i went for the lentil salad.  i like lentil soup but i'd never had lentil salad before.\u000a\u000aand i discovered one thing...........\u000a\u000ai hate cold lentils!  \u000a\u000ayuck!  \u000a\u000ai tried forcing them down, 'cos i don't believe in wasting food, but to no avail!\u000a\u000aso ya, mom and i will come back, but now we know what to avoid here!

Vwhen the phipps made great strides on becoming more green and sustainable, they also made a commitment to making the cafe more healthy and environmentally friendly.  the foods are locally sourced, the menu items are organic and thoughtfully prepared.   for example, it's hard to find healthy options for children, however the phipps has gotten rid of their high sugar drinks in favor of healthier options.  \u000a\u000athe soups are quite wonderful, and so are the salads. \u000a\u000athe cafe is careful about recycling, too, which i find to be a thoughtful touch. \u000a\u000athe sunshine streams into the glass walls, this cafe is a good place to change your mood to positive.

Vnot quite sure what i did wrong by going in here.  i was loving the vibe of the place and really enjoy that they spin their own music.  the set up was nice.  airy even.  didn't feel too confined in there and was easy to browse their inventory.\u000a\u000ai went into the store because i've been wanting one of their 412 shirts.  can't for the life of me figure out why they only had xs and xxl sizes in both styles.  i searched all size piles they had out.  i was getting a complex and had to leave, either i'm too fat or too skinny for their stuff. \u000a\u000ai can guarantee that i would have bought a shirt upon stopping in, but my size was unavailable.  i suppose i'll have to look up their website.

Vafter a little more than a week in ireland with my husband, it was good to get out on a friday night with the girl posse.  we decided on dinner and a movie and we wanted to try some place we hadn't been to before.  hofbrauhaus tries to replicate the 400 year old hofbrauhaus in munich.  now since i'm 1/2 german, i thought this place would really appeal to me.\u000a\u000afor an appetizer, we started on the pretzels with beer cheese.  i think that they are freshly baked, but they certainly are so delicious.  my main course was the wursteller, which was mettwurst, bierwurst, and bratwurst.  piled high with sauerkraut (i love 'kraut.  why-oh-why do i love stinky foods?), and mashed potatoes, it was so good.  they reportedly have great burgers here too.\u000a\u000ano visit to a good german joint would be complete without dessert.  so we split two orders of appel strudel with vanilla and raspberry sauce.  i shared one with my friend marla.  sherry and maryann split the other.  like i always say, "pump that insulin, susan, pump!"\u000a\u000aone thing, this place can get very busy, so it's best to go early like we did.

Vi dug it, but definitely only the part outside where the polka band and college kids shaking their asses on tables weren't.  i was kind of disappointed by the soft pretzels:  they seemed like they came from a microwave and the cheese wasn't as flavorful as i excitedly thought it would be.  maybe i expected too much?  my hefewiezen was goooooooodddddddddddd to the point where i drank about 2.5 times as much as i should have.  the guy waiting on us was a complete angel-- i'd go insane if i had to wait on that many plastered barely legals on a regular basis, but he seemed genuinely unbothered.

Vhuge portions, delicious beer! \u000a\u000abecause i'm a veghead, my boyfriend and i usually opt for an appetizer platter to share (i really wish the sauerkraut balls didn't have sausage in them!!) then he gets an entree and i eventually start picking off of his plate, the mashed potatoes are velvety smooth, the sauerkraut used to have a creamy texture but at our most recent trip it was more like what i'm used to - firm an stringy - both ways worked for me. i'm not sure if this was a fluke or if they changed the way its prepared. the potato pancakes are as big as my head, very tasty, and filling. the beer cheese schnitzel reminds me of grandmas home made dumplings and cheese, actually i think everything kind of has that homemade quality to it. i can't really think of anything that has disappointed us.

Vi like the hofbrauhaus a lot.  there aren't that many of them in the world, so we're lucky to have one!  that being said, we only visit once or twice a year, usually in the fall as we're fans of their oktoberfest brew.\u000a\u000athe pretzels are great, and my husband had the jagerschnitzel which he said was amazing.  i honestly don't know how these people expect you to eat a meal after a half liter of beer and two soft pretzels, so i ordered a side of beer cheese spaetzle for dinner.  it's so good!  \u000a\u000ai definitely recommend sitting in the biergarden if it's nice out--you don't have to wait, it's self seating, the service is fast and they have a full bar down there as well.  there are twinkly lights strung up between the trees, plenty of bench seating, and you get a view of the river.\u000a\u000anot to mention you don't have to do the chicken dance down there. :)

Vfun breakfast place with good food and decently accommodating. the server was nice and the prices were good. the eggs florentine was good but the hollandaise seemed a bit thin and i'm not a fan of sesame seeds - which the bagel had ample of. the chocolate-hazelnut spread covered french toast, however, tasted delicious. the atmosphere was fun and quirky, a nice, crammed little neighborhood diner. the orange juice was expensive, but fresh

Vi only come here when i have those moments when  i think i need a haircut right then and there. i don't know why i have tortured myself and returned. 3 times i've been there. 3 times i've asked for short in back, long in front with a severe angle. 3 times i walked out with a plain jane bob. the employees *try* to make small talk but just end up talking to each other about how much they hate working there. \u000a\u000aat the end of the day you get what you pay for- a cheap generic haircut.

Vyou get what you pay for.  no one should really complain about a haircut from a place that is a chain. \u000a\u000astaff is friendly, not saying that they remember who you are, but they do store your previous haircut in the computer. so don't be surprised if they remember the number they used on the clippers.  most staff are easy to talk to, but avoid the one that talks about anger management when he has a pair of scissors in his hands.\u000a\u000athey do have an app for smart phones that allows you to schedule yourself for an appointment so you don't have to wait as long. also, i give you kudos for using 'clippers' as your dividers between stations. although i don't always feel like i'm sailing when i'm here.

Vi can't believe that i've never been to this place before! especially when it's so close to home. \u000a\u000ai had a long work week and so i decided that i wanted to take my husband out to dinner. we walked over to this place and not only was i very satisfied, i'm glad i walked down that meal. \u000a\u000awe started off with something i never tried before--italian egg rolls! they were a mixture of italian veggies, rolled up in dough and fried to perfection, just like the egg rolls at the best chinese places. they had something that looked interesting, the pesto burger, but i was there to chow on beef! so i went for the small cut of fillet mignon, which comes with a salad, bread, and side. rick ordered the full 16oz new york strip. \u000a\u000ai told him it was okay to order what he wanted. i was in the mood for an evening out with my guy and everything was on me! we both love our beef done medium well, and these were done so perfectly. the service here was also impeccable.   as the other poster says, it's located under a bowling alley, but once inside you'd never know it.\u000a\u000ait's also right next door to the squirrel hill theatre.  rick asked me if i wanted to go see a movie right afterwards.  i said "no" 'cos i wanted to walk down my meal.  besides, i was in the mood for something else after that dinner!

Vdespite the proliferation of such places as ben & jerry's and coldstone creamery, there's still a place for the good old basics.  and to me, there's nothing as yummy as good old fashioned chocolate ice cream.  and as a diabetic who loves ice cream, i've become alarmed at the gigantic portions places like this are now offering up.  even a cone adds unwanted carbs, so i'm glad i can still get a single scoop of chocolatey goodness in a cup.

Vlike most italian restaurants in pittsburgh it's meh, not bad, edible but nothing i would go back for. the calzone was very greasy and the mozzarella they used was very stringy making eating it hard. the veal cappella was edible with way too much peppercorns on it and it didn't make much sense to me, most places crush the peppercorns, even if to only split them in half, they simply dumped whole peppercorns all over the veal.\u000a\u000aprices were reasonable, food was edible 2.4 stars.

Vconvenient to the waterworks cinema, la cappella is one of those places you eat at before or after going to a movie.  know what i mean?  you go there 'cos the food's reasonably good. the service is quick, and the theatre's right down the street.  \u000a\u000arick and i went with some friends of ours to see "j. edgar" (highly recommended) and so we stopped in here before the show.  we began our dinners with the pepperoni rolls and i've gotta admit they were quite good.  we all opted for the pasta-bilities for our dinners.  the way this works is you select your own pasta, then select your sauce.  yeah, it starts at $11.99 but then they start charging $1.00 extra for wheat, rainbow, or tortellini pastas.  then if you want to upgrade your sauces to meat sauce, bolognese, alla vodka, or alfredo, it'll run you a couple of extra $$ on top of that.  \u000a\u000awhat, are you guys united airlines or something and you gotta charge me extra for more leg room?\u000a\u000arick had the wheat pasta and i had the penne.  can't remember what our friends had, though.  so the food here isn't what you'd get in a fine trattoria.  but it's a good neighborhood/ strip mall italian joint and i'd say it's worth about 3.5 stars.

Vthis review is for the brand new fox chapel location conveniently located across the river from my home.  i was happy to find this location.  interestingly enough i would check the website occassionally and they would say and still do "fox chapel location coming soon",,, well let me be the one to break the news its been there for months and is a great new addition.  i am a self confessed sushi addict and am constantly looking for good places to feed my addiction.  so, i've been here three times over the past two weekends.  i feel i've been there enough times to give a worthwhile review.  the location is "old freeport rd", which is the back road located between freeport rd. and the apartments/club by the river.  there is a very large parking lot and unfortunately is relatively empty.  the building is beautiful, you enter the main area and above the entrance are hand blown glass chandelier type thing.  it's kind of like the one in the bellagio, vegas entrance but on a much smaller level.  directly in front is a big marble bar and sushi bar to the side.  if you keep walking too the right there is comfy seating in an open air space because the windows have been open every time i've visited.  the bathrooms are very nice with marble and one door leading to the rr and then seperate entryways for the different sections.  the dining room is pretty large and they may even have a private dining room.  i've never sat in the dining room, so i can't comment that much on dining room service or comfort.  however, the bar has been my home on my last three visits and haven't been disappointed either time.  the first time the gals behind the bar were sue (she's also the marketing person for penn ave. fish) and another gal forget her name.  there was one other regular at the bar.  the sushi chef didn't speak much english so i didn't get his name, but he was a true professional.  i started with my standard white tuna and salmon sashimi, cut perfectly,,,wonderfully fresh and presented beautifully.  i also tried the seafood salad which is a delicious healthy serving of various seafood prepared in a very spicy sauce with delicious scallops as well.  they also have a great sake menu, with plenty of text on the medicinal qualities of good sake and how it doesn't give you a hangover (kind of have to disagree with that fact).  i tried their best sake which was $18/glass, but also sampled another at $10/glass that was just as good ask the bartender jess or the other gals, they'll let you know which to choose.  they also do samplers with the sake.  i'd suggest staying away from the samplers because they tend to mix sweet, with dry, and clear with cloudy,,, chances are you're not gonnal like all of them.  on another visit jason was the sushi chef who jimmy wan recruited from nyc.  he's a true pro and made me this incredible spicy scallop warm salad served in 1/2 of a baby avocado.  it was unreal.  he also made these cucumber thin slices stuffed with some type of crab that were really good.  he suggested i take my raw white tuna and fry it for a second, totally different texture and taste (however, sashimi white tuna is stil my fav).  a couple last points one of the reasons jimmy wan has such good chefs is that he was the president of the chinese restaurant association nationally and was able to recruit from all around.  and, don't get this place confused with tai pei fox chapel which also is referred to as tai pei and is located on freeport not old freeport rd.  jimmy and the owners of the other place are rivals and i was told he moved back so close to put them out of busines.. the food is just as good here as cranberry in a much better space.

Vplease note that the address i've shown is approximate.  the eliza furnace was built on an old railroad line into downtown pittsburgh.  \u000a\u000auntil the 1980s, i believe, the port authority transit (pat) ran commuter trains down this line.  it sat for several years until it was decided to make it into a bike path.  it is often referred to as "the jail trail" because it goes right past the allegheny county jail.  \u000a\u000ait's really only a connecting path right now because it only goes as far as oakland, to the south end of schenley park and panther hollow.  you won't see much green space along here, but rather new office buildings and traces of pittsburgh's once industrial past.  indeed, for a stretch, it's right-of-way is between the east and westbound lanes of the parkway east (i-376)!  still, it's an interesting ride.  \u000a\u000ait will eventually be part of the great allegheny passage, which will eventually link pittsburgh with cumberland, md.  from there, one would be able to connect with the c&o towpath all the way to washington, dc.  so a pittsburgh-washington, dc bike ride could become a reality soon.  what's missing is the 9-mile segment between pittsburgh and mckeesport.  see here http://www.atatrail.org/maps/map1.cfm and here http://www.atatrail.org/maps/map.cfm for maps.\u000a\u000amy husband and i used this for a warm-up ride today.  it was our first ride of the season.  so what we did was a round-trip from our home in squirrel hill to downtown via schenley park and the eliza furnace trail.  it was a good way to begin the season, but eventually we'll do longer rides.

Vfinally!  my husband rick and i were able to get out and do our warm up ride.  the weather was cloudy but at least it was dry out.  geez louise, it's been a wet and cold april  so far and rick and i were just itching to get out and do that first ride of the season.  we'd just gotten our road bikes and our mountain bikes tuned up too.  \u000a\u000awe started at our home in squirrel hill, then went through schenley park down to the eliza furnace trail.  from there we took the trail downtown and headed over to station square.  from there we took the great allegheny passage trail to the hot metal bridge and return.\u000a\u000athe eliza furnace trail still isn't much to look at.  eventually it'll be part of the great allegheny passage connecting pittsburgh and mckeesport with ohiopyle and cumberland.  but for now it's good for a connecting trail or if you're doing a warm up or short ride.  \u000a\u000aoh and rick and i are building up towards a mckeesport-cumberland ride later this year.

Vi'm tired of chipotle now. it's time for something new. . .like istanbul grille. the man who waited on me - who i assume was the owner- was very warm friendly. he made me feel very welcomed and that was a big plus for me. for my meal, i chose a chicken salad along with three sides. the owner was very generous and gave me extra sides for no additional costs. i  had so much food that i couldn't even eat it all. i loved all the different vegetables and flavors. i wish istanbul grille was located in my neighborhood as i would go there to eat every week if i could. the food and service was great and i will definitely come here more frequently!

Vi typically drive a little further to the big store on n highland for my boozy needs, but swing by this place occasionally.  like october said, it's small but has pretty much everything you'll need. having a liquor store across the street from the geagle comes in handy when you're throwing together an italian meal, and you've realized there's no more chianti in the house.

Vit's not entirely the fault of the wine and spirits store that it sucks - it's pennsylvania's fault.  when we moved here, it boggled my mind that this state (excuse me, "commonwealth") forces you to buy wine and liquor in state stores, and beer somewhere else entirely.  it is completely and utterly ridiculous.\u000a\u000athat being said, how can you rate a state store?  they all inherently suck given that they exist, so what are the criteria?  well, at any wine/spirits shop in other states, i'd expect knowledgeable, helpful employees who are passionate about the product.  this store lacks that.  i expect a good selection of unique and interesting offerings.  this store also lacks that.  an atmosphere that's pleasant to shop in?  forget it.  what this store does have is wine and booze around the block from my apartment, which is convenient.  sometimes the cashiers are friendly and funny.  but that's about it.  i miss the pleasure of shopping in a real wine shop.  the state stores, this one included, pretty much suck the fun out of drinking.\u000a\u000athey have all the basics, but you won't find many specialty items here, excepting a few local wines.

V1. free wifi\u000a2. good chinese buns at chinese bun prices.\u000a3. good french pastries at chinese bun prices.\u000a\u000ai came for the baked goods, bubble tea was secondary, but the pearls were soft all the way through and the tea was mild if anything. i liked all of the baked goods except for one, but hot curry shortcake is probably an acquired taste.

Vi've been waiting for this place to open since i first heard about it a couple of months ago. as someone who grew up on the west coast, pittsburgh has a bizarre lack of dedicated frozen yogurt and smoothie places so i was excited to finally see a yogurt place.\u000a\u000akarmic yogurt is definitely inspired by the popular pinkberry, and similarly has regular and green tea flavored yogurt (no pomegranate) and fresh-cut fruit toppings. i tried the green tea which is apparently made with real matcha tea powder and had strawberries, mango, and kiwi on top. the fruit was fresh, and the yogurt was good although i agree with the other reviewer that it may not have been quite as tart and was a bit softer.\u000a\u000aprices are fairly high, but are on a par with pinkberry. i'd like to see raspberries as a topping, and perhaps a frequent customer card (buy ten, get one free) or something like that. unfortunately, there's not anywhere to sit yet, but i'm sure that will come in time. the location is fairly good for shadyside, so as long as enough people discover it, it will probably do fairly well. also, what's up with the holes in the middle of the servings?

Vthe last couple of times i tried this place, the yogurt wasn't very good, they still haven't added any decent seating, and the prices are still too high. karmic waited too long - there is now a better yogurt shop in squirrel hill. probably won't bother going back to karmic again.

Vwe were staying in the grassmarket area, and after a night of drinking all i wanted was a green juice.  low and behold, hula appeared like a beacon and gave me what i needed.  \u000a\u000ai told them what i was looking for, and they recommended a juice not on the menu - all i can recall was mango and spinach (i think apple too?  ginger?) but once i heard those things i was like - sold.  we got a wheatgrass "booster" too which didn't affect the taste like i thought it would, fortunately.  i think it was about 5 for a large with the booster.  worth it!  my fianc and i shared it, though i drank most of it because it was so addictively good.  so fruity and yummy, you'd never know how many vegetables you were consuming!  i watched them make it, which was really fun, they have these crazy industrial blenders and just jam whole apples in there.  service was really friendly, took a while to get the juice but the cafe was so cozy and cute that i didn't mind waiting.  we didn't eat there, but their menu looks so wonderful and healthy that i hope to grab a bite there another day.

Vthis could possibly be the worst location for a primanti.  from the moment we walked in, until the moment that the food we ordered arrived, i was totally at a loss of words.\u000a\u000agranted it was busy when we arrived, but the serviced lacked so horribly that i thought about leaving without retrieving our food.  i ended up getting the usual and my friend just wanted an order of fries.  as the minutes grew on and the shoves became more and more obvious because people were trying to get closer to the bar my temper started to rise.\u000a\u000awhen the food finally was ready i asked for it to go at this point.  i was happiest when i was finally walking out the door, away from this crowded spot.

Vmy husband and i ate here since everywhere else was closed on easter and we needed a place to watch the first baseball game of the season. (which reminds me, i should probably write an angry review about how slow comcast is to hook people's cable up around here...)\u000a\u000ait's a chain steakhouse with a texas vibe, forgettable overall.  the husband got a steak and fries which he deemed "good."  (there's a reason he's not on yelp...)  i had a salmon caesar salad with way too much dressing, but the salmon was perfectly cooked.  everything was quite expensive, with meals starting around $15.\u000a\u000ai don't think that we would come back.  i would rate this place around 2.5--rounded up for the excellent service (even though we sat at the bar and didn't drink) and being open on a major holiday.

Vi really wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.\u000a\u000asupposedly this was their first night in delivering on their on and not using a delivery service.  when i placed my order i gave my name and number so that when they arrived i would be made aware.  after a hour of waiting i called back to see what the hold up was since we were told a 30 minute wait.  when i called, i was informed that i didn't leave a number.  hmm, wander what number they wrote down then?\u000a\u000athe food was less than stellar as well.  as a whole we ordered a wide variety of items to see what the food would totally be like.  collectively we decided the food was meh.  i personally ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings.  i got a hamburger and a few store bought onion rings.  my colleagues picked items from gyros to hot dogs to stromboli.  all said they had better.  maximum flavor might be false advertising.\u000a\u000aone thing that was good about it was that after such a long wait we got our order for free.\u000a\u000a$3 delivery fee.

Vthere are better places out there.\u000a\u000a it doesn't offer half of the toppings that other places do and i think its somewhat over priced ( mainly because of the limited fixin's). \u000a\u000athe staff have always been friendly towards me and its never crowded (good for me, bad for business) so i can get in & out quickly.

Vsome of the girls and i decided to go out after work today.  since it was my turn to decide, i thought we'd get some coffee instead.  we came here 'cos the one in liberty center, across the street from where i work, is only open until 6pm or so.  this one, in the cultural distract, is open a little later.\u000a\u000ai can't believe i never reviewed the downtown crazy mochas before.  they have fabulous coffee here!  it's a really nice place to unwind after a day at the office, or if you're going to the theater, or if you need  a quick caffeine fix at the office.

Vthis crazy mocha is very handy 'cos it's right across the street from work.  they have wonderful coffee here.  too bad they're not open later than 6pm.  worth it if you need a quick cup after work, but if you want to hang out awhile, go to the one down the street in the cultural district.

Vif you're a coffee fanatic like me, you know the drill.  arrive at work, coffee in hand.  remove the lid to let it cool a little.  take a whiff of it, soaking in just a wee bit of that coffee aroma and preparing your palate for that caffeiney goodness.  begin imbibing a sip at a time.  slowly resume form of human being.\u000a\u000ai'm so glad i have both crazy mocha and cool beans right across the street from work.  i usually like to alternate and some mornings i think i make it from the bus to here on autopilot!

Veat 'n park is pittsburgh's version of ihop.\u000a\u000agreat food at cheap prices. really good salads, sandwiches and burgers. like dave p. said, this is one of the better locations probably because it's right next to the headquarters.\u000a\u000aservice has always been go at this location.

Vbeing next door to corporate you would have higher expectations. \u000a\u000athe breakfast bar is lame. back home (fayette county) there seems to be a lot more variety such as corn fritters, apple cinnamon "thingies", and little potato cakes to name a few. the salad bar is just as bad, the side dishes they offer are usually ruined with meat which makes no sense to me because the tiny ham cubes and bacon bits are already on the bar so if anyone wanted to add them into their linguini salad or whatever, they could.\u000a\u000athe late night patrons are a bit unsavory, speaking of which, my ex roommate used to work here and i could tell you some stories but i don't want to freak you out.

Vfun little organic greek place in touristy old montreal, we sat on the patio and were fairly undisturbed in moderately cold weather. fun people watching(i saw a drive-by photoshoot that had me laughing for the rest of the day) and a great bistro atmosphere for drinks. i wasn't inside much but the bathroom was nice, and i don't see a problem in the $5 charge of the restroom -- it's a nice way of saying that the restroom is for customers only. the food was decent greek fare. the grilled cheese was nothing special but the veggie burger with tzatziki was good, if not a little expensive for having no sides.

Vcafe milano is another gem in downtown pittsburgh.  they've got a fairly extensive menu here--calzones, hoagies, signature sandwiches, salads, gyros, and of course a very comprehensive pizza menu.  \u000a\u000amilano's really good for a quick lunch.  they have pizza by the slice here and individual mini-pizzas too.  i ordered two slices, each with pepperoni and mushrooms.  i figured if i couldn't finish both, i could have one tomorrow.  and as we all know, pizza's great the 2nd day.  good pizza here, and if you can tear yourself away from work for a proper lunch hour, do like i did and get a couple of slices or a sandwich to go and take it over to a nearby plaza for a little al fresco dining.

Vi expected this pizza to taste a lot better than it did for how much i paid for it.  i really think papa john's would have been better (and cheaper!)  two factors elevate it from 2 stars to 3:\u000a\u000a1) i love any pizza place that lets me put feta on my pizza and\u000a2) the delivery was ridiculously fast for a friday night.

Vit seems this restaurants it serves both thai and vietnamese food. the deco reflects such as well. towards the front of the restaurant or some well lit tables with some large windows. towards the back is more dimly lit tables for the more romantic atmosphere. \u000a\u000athere is a very large selection of foods from appetizer to entres to desserts and even drinks. i had ordered the steam chinking dumplings. they were 6 of the biggest dumplings stuffed with a lot of meat. the grilled pork chops and lemongrass was very juicy and tender. one of the better ones i've had. i'm going to have to try the pho and thai curry next time.

V3.5 stars.  i'm typically a pretty harsh reviewer when it comes to buffets since to me buffet quality food is synonymous to takeout quality, and why would someone dine out to just have takeout?  also, for the same cost and time spent at a buffet one can go to a much better restaurant with better tasting and quality food.  with that in mind, i have to say hokkaido isn't as bad as i thought it was going to be.\u000a\u000aso here's what i have to recommend:\u000a\u000a1.  go for lunch.  only go for lunch.  at $8.99, it's probably one of the cheapest if not the cheapest buffet out there.  if you're shelling out over $20 for dinner including drinks, why not just go to a chinese restaurant w/ a nicer ambiance and better quality food like china palace?\u000a\u000a2.  go early.  i've been there once around 12:30 and once around 2:30 pm and there's a giant difference in the quality of the food.  get there either before or during the lunch rush.  they have adequate seating and it's not like you'll be waiting... it is a buffet.  food will be coming out a lot faster and everything will be fresher.\u000a\u000a3.  stick w/ salmon nigiri.  if you're here for the sushi, their rolls just don't cut it, and their salmon nigiri is probably the only thing worth eating.  their other options aren't really passable.\u000a\u000a4.  get their dim sum.  if you're going when they're busy, fresh handmade dim sum is being made all the time.  and where in pittsburgh can you get non-frozen sui mei?  i also like their pork buns (only if they're freshly made of course).\u000a\u000a5.  avoid the usual suspects.  you know what fried rice tastes like.  you know what lo mein tastes like.  you know what chicken teriyaki and general tso's tastes like.  you know it's all loaded with excessive msg and you'll have cotton mouth while feeling like crap later.\u000a\u000a6.  do try their mongolian bbq / teppanyaki.  the chef actually knows what he's doing and cooks kinda okay.  if you're new to mongolian bbq, it might be daunting, but after a while you should be able to figure out what sauce combinations taste good.  the chef can make a sauce for you, but i don't like my dishes as salty as your average patron.\u000a\u000ai find myself eating their salmon nigiri, their dim sum, their beef brisket soup, and their "szechuan-style" pork.  i also get some veggies, be it baby bok choi, green beans, or broccoli for the sole reason of pretending to be healthy.  i stay clear of all their other sushi, their, pizza, sausage, pork loin, and random americanized chinese.\u000a\u000aa quick nigiri fix with some handmade dim sum in pittsburgh for 11 bucks seems pretty good for me.

Vi am a hokkaido fan!  even at its most expensive price ($18), it's a bargain for all-you-can-eat sushi, crab legs, whole crabs, shrimp cocktail...\u000a\u000athey also have standard chinese buffet fare (the sweet and sour chicken is great!) and even some american favorites like pizza, etc.\u000a\u000aalthough the sushi isn't quite as good as tokyo sushi buffet, it is pretty good especially considering the variety this place offers.\u000a\u000ai will definitely be back!

Vfayette county girls know a thing or two about buffets and this place has got it all. i'm a vegetarian so i have more options at lunch time, plus its cheaper. my boyfriend and i walk out of there like stuffed pigs for $20 + tip.\u000a\u000ai don't want to be redundant so i'm going to skip talking about specific items as you can read about them in the other reviews.

Vyummyyyyy.  (imagine that spoken in a cookie monster type voice, and you can imagine the scope of the deliciousness to be found at hokkaido).\u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i drove past a sign that said "japanese seafood buffet" on the way to the waterfront, and we both immediately stopped conversing to note "that sounds delicious....i want to go to there."  coincidentally, our insurance agent mentioned hokkaido as one of the best meals of his life, and we knew that it was our destiny.  our delicious destiny.\u000a\u000awe arrived at hokkaido around 545 pm on a saturday - super early and lame, i know, but we didn't want to have to wait for a table.  plan worked - we were seated immediately and were in the buffet line in mere moments.  the buffet is arranged around two walls of the restaurant - it's very accessible, and easy to duck in and out to grab a quick nom of something without waiting in the whole line.  the first area is fruit/salad bar, which we mostly bypassed, except we grabbed some seaweed salad and calamari - also noted they had kimchi there as well.\u000a\u000amoving on, you hit some more standard asian buffet classics, various chinese entrees, and some more unique offerings.  i grabbed some sauteed scallops, szechuan short rib, and then my eyes fell on the whole steamed crabs and the crab legs.  not being in possession of the proper crab cracking tools, i went for the legs instead of the whole crab.  these are very popular, but they are constantly refilling the tray with fresh hot legs of nomminess, so don't worry - you'll get some.\u000a\u000anext is a mongolian barbecue-esque area, where you pick your raw protein and vegetables and a dude stir fries it for you on a hot grill.  we skipped that, and the carving station next to him (couldn't see what type of meat it was).  next is a baked/fried area filled with super-delicious looking things like egg rolls, seafood pancakes, shumai, and all kinds of awesome japanese buns and sweets like red bean filled buns, taro buns, and sesame roll things. after that is a good-size sushi area, where sushi chefs work throughout the night to refill the platters as they empty.  there is also a small "american section" with boring looking pizza and corn and other lame things, and there's a dessert area too.\u000a\u000amost of what we had was deeeeeelicious!  especially noteworthy are the crab legs, the red bean buns (which i became obsessed with after one bite), the shumai, and the ngiri sushi.  the rolls were all decent, some were falling apart a little bit, but the sashimi and ngiri were undoubtedly fresh.  gorgeous cuts, fish was silky and fresh in the mouth - what more can you ask for from a sushi buffet?  i never expected sushi of this quality here - not saying it's the best i've ever had, but for $16.99 all you can eat sushi and crab legs and a million other things?  a steal, people.\u000a\u000awe had a plate of hot food each, a plate of sushi each, then a pathetic attempt at dessert (small cheesecake piece, small other cake piece, another red bean bun) and then rolled ourselves home.  we had to eat everything on our plates because they will charge you $8 for uneaten food on your plate!  not a risk we felt like taking, so load up your plates wisely!\u000a\u000aand don't hurt anyone over those crab legs - they will bring more, i promise!

Vthe last two times i went for lunch they didn't have the tofu with eggplant which disappointed me greatly. i was psyched when i seen miso soup...too bad it was disgusting. it lacked flavor and there was a lot of silken tofu in it which was so tasteless it broke my heart. i wish they would add extra firm tofu to the hibachi bar, maybe some day but i don't know how many more chances i will give hokkaido. service is still uber efficient but they really need to step up their sushi game, once i was there and there were out of sushi??? this was at lunch time and there were some pretty large parties that probably wiped them out but they should have been on top of that.

Vi'm a huge fan of a buffet.  it's the one type of restaurant that you can walk into and not feel pressured to have to make the perfect selection off a menu.  especially if it's a place you've never been to before.\u000a\u000athe waiters/waitresses are swift, even if they are only delivering a drink to you or taking away a plate you just finished.  i think they might be ninjas.  one second you are sitting there and the next the appear out of nowhere...it's mind boggling.\u000a\u000athe buffet itself has everything from hot to cold.  i feel as if i'm browsing the shelves at a market somewhere deciding if i really need that item or not.  doesn't matter, i put it on my plate, if i don't like it, no worries.  of course being a chinese style buffet they have my favorite (a probably a lot of other people's favorite), general tso's.  i always end up getting way to much at a buffet and end up leaving as if i just ate thanksgiving dinner.  you know, unbutton the pants, and then sit back for a nap type of feeling.\u000a\u000aseafood salad, general tso's, garlic sting beans, honeydew, sushi, won ton soup, and to finish it off, some ice cream.  happy as a clam sums it up.\u000a\u000ahowever, i'm still weirded out by the chicken feet...o.o

Vi'm a moe's fan, i'll admit. i don't think the flavor is that good(i think all of these types of restaurants taste like a mexican subway, and by that i mean any form of imagery you can imagine). but moe's wins out among the big 3(moe's, qdoba, and chipotle) in a pinch for a single reason: moe's offers free chips, which means for less than $3 i can get chips, salsa, and a unanimous decision(veggie taco with guac and sour cream). seriously, how can you beat that?\u000a\u000ahonestly, it's just a chain fast food burrito place. you know what you're getting when you walk through the door.

Vparis 66.  right when you walk in you'll hear the chefs shouting out for ingredients in strong french accents.  it's amazing.\u000a\u000aon my first trip to paris 66 i tried their beef bourguignon and it was pretty good.  i also tried their quiche lorraine and their french pizza.  the quiche makes me happy.  like so happy.  finding a quiche place in pittsburgh.  om nom nom nom.  the pizza was eh; i'd never order it again.\u000a\u000aon my second trip i decided to get their savory paris 66 crepe (mushrooms, tomatoes, ham, and an over easy egg.  for a choice of soup or salad, i got their soup which was a cream base with cauliflower puree and a dash of paprika.  it was surprisingly hearty and i barely finished my crepe (my eating companion helped me out).  the crepes are definitely worth getting, but don't set your expectations too high b/c it's not like the ultimate crepe that exists.\u000a\u000ai absolutely love the decor.  when you're sitting inside you would never imagine that you're in pittsburgh.  the outdoor seating is peaceful but there's not much to look \u000a\u000athe last time i was there, we saw some prepped salads about to be sent to tables and they looked gorgeous.  i definitely want to try one next time.

Vthis is a great new addition to the blossoming food scene of e. liberty.  i was a bit tentative at first after having been very excited to try this place out, based on a couple mixed reviews on this site as well as some other input from family.  i can only speak to my experience and it was close to perfect.  annie and i had lunch here today on a cool summer/fall day.  this place is very "yelpy" (refer to my penn ave. fish company review for a definition).  the space itself is pretty close to perfect.  it's located a few storefronts down from kelly's and when you walk in you are very much transported to a french bistro.  you are greeted warmly by the chef or should i say "master crepe chef" (actually a title) who is behind the small cooking area to the right.  the colors are very warm and the detail is impressive down to the french clocks and pictures on the walls.  the space seats probably about 30+ inside and there is a wonderful little deck in the back with four to five tables and a small garden.  one of the other details i appreciate is that each table has its own pitcher of water (just like in france).  they sell pastry in the front on your way in or out.  the hostess was very friendly and the staff was top notch from start to finish even though we got there close to closinf time.  in fact, i was very impressed with how pleasant everyone was given the fact that they were closing for lunch.  the chef is from france and just about everyone who works there speaks french as well.  the owner fred rongier is also 100% french (btw, fred also sold me my car and it was the only time in my life that i actually felt good after buying a car).  i see he applies the same service attitude to this place.  another thing which  i really like about this place is that it is the only french restaurant that i'm aware of around pittsburgh that is inexpensive.  this is a crepe restaurant, however they do serve a feature each evening that is more of an entree' type selection and once a month they do a gourmet dinner that is reservation only.  okay, onto the food.  i ordered a delicious "le st. germain", which is a ham and swiss cheese buckwheat crepe.  i also added an egg.  the crepe was thin and even and very tasty.  the cheese was generous and the ham was a very good quality and tasty.  my only small complaint is that it would have been better if the egg was runny and not fried.  it was served with a cup of soup.  i had the pea soup which had a very layered and complex taste, perfectly seasoned with a ton of peas and not overwhelming with the cream.  the only small issue is that it could have been served a little hotter.  annie ordered one of the best sandwiches i can recall eating maybe ever.  it was the "croque monsier" which again is basically a ham and cheese sandwich, but it was overflowing with delicious swiss cheese and crispy bread perfectly warm and with cheese on the outside that was a bit crispy (burnt in a good way). she also had the french onion soup which actually isn't that french at all and you'd have a hard time finding "french onion" soup in france.  however, this was top notch french onion soup served in a small crock with a lot of cheese (again burnt in a good way) and a rich, deep onion broth.  we both finished with a nice light versailles crepe served simply with butter and a little sugar.  the perfect dessert.  a couple other small points... i had a delicious cafe au' lait.  this is a true espresso bar.  the server was very pleasant and professional throughout.   i look forwarded to coming back again and i think this may become a regular stop for me and annie.

Vin a great part of pittsburgh, this east liberty restaurant is run by a french couple (french is spoken in the open kitchen). i've been for brunch, where i've sat on the heated patio and enjoyed their buckwheat crepes.\u000a\u000agood french food for reasonable prices in a great atmosphere. what's not to like?

Vthree oddities stood out for lunch:\u000a\u000a1. out of 20+ people, my friend and the waiter were the only two guys in the place.\u000a2. the wait staff stayed in overdrive; perfect service, and i'm not sure i've seen wait staff do so much without ever seeming hurried.\u000a3. the food here is superior to most of what i munched on visiting paris.\u000a\u000agreat soup of the day (mushroom), an enormous salad that didn't cut quality, and amazing savory crepes.  will go back anytime i drive by and don't see a line.

Vparis 66 just got a new chef and a new dinner menu about a month ago, along with some new kitchen equipment so anyone who liked the potential of this place, be sure to give it another shot. i stopped in off of the street to get a pain au chocolat which they advertise for $3(they also sell baugettes, croissants, and a few other things in a similar way), but after learning that they bake them on-demand(pre-ordering recommended) and that it would take 15 minutes i opted for the apple tart i saw in the pastry case.\u000a\u000athe service was friendly but the tart was actually priced as a full-fledged dessert, so that wound up costing about 3x as much as i had entered intending to pay. you might say that's my fault, and it would be more appropriately priced had i just finished dinner at this place, but to walk up to a counter and ask for something from behind the glass to be so expensive was a bit much for me.\u000a\u000ac'est la vie, though - they sprinkled it with powdered sugar and sent me along my way with a small side of homemade caramel. when i got home, i gave it a taste, it was really delicious, and the caramel sauce was out of this world. i would eat that stuff on just about any dessert item they had. it took away most of the sting of the purchase, and i'm glad i stopped in, and i will return to get my pain au chocolat

Vi enjoy bistro 66, but not enough to spontaneously ask to go there.  the crepes are good, but no better than crepes parisiennes, which are also cheaper by far.  i tried the brunch, and although tasty, for the price, i'd much rather go to casbah or point brugge.\u000a\u000awe also gave them a whirl for dinner, and were underwhelmed.  there's not anything wrong per se, just nothing spectacular.  so, given the price, i'd much rather go elsewhere.\u000a\u000atheir pastries, though, are legit.

Vparis 66 reminded me of the french cafes in paris. our food was excellent and prepared exactly to our order.  the wait staff was attentive and helpful, but also knew when to leave us alone.  the wine list was strong on the french wines, although i think they could add a few more wines by the glass.  great desserts, they have a really talented pastry chef.   i was really charmed by my first visit here, and i'm sure it won't be my last.

Vi'll admit that i was not hugely impressed with paris 66 the first couple of times i went there. the crepes were fine (but who wanted to pay so much for crepes when you could get perfectly reasonable ones from crepes parisiennes in shadyside? but, i guess that's no longer an option), brunch was fine, and dinner was fine. i mean, everything was fine. but nothing was stellar (except for the macaroons. those were out of this world). \u000a\u000aso, i didn't go back for a while. thankfully i was persuaded to go by some friends, and what a change! i think management is trying really hard to go hard-core french, so the servers all speak french and appear to be legitimate frenchpersons! the menu has changed and now the dinner entrees are much more traditional french fare. \u000a\u000awhen we last went, they unfortunately had run out of everything we wanted to order. and i'm not even exaggerating; i tried to order the duck breast... no go. my husband and another friend tried to order the lamb shank special... no go. they even told us they only had one left, and so my husband and our friend had to decide who would get it, and then they came back to tell us that they actually didn't have any left! despite all this, we really enjoyed the meal and would be happy to go back again. i guess management just has to work on procurement... excellent desserts, but... wait for it... no more macaroons. gah! this place is too popular for its own good!\u000a\u000aso, if you weren't impressed with paris 66 before, give it another whirl. it's worth the try.

Vwhen we first walked in and the entire bar turned around to look because we were the only white kids in there, i was a little alarmed. but everyone was friendly and we didn't get picked on. the place wasn't too crowded, found a table easily and got my beer on. yuengeling is $2/pint on tap. otherwise, it's pretty run-down and smelly - ripped bench cushions, wobbly tables, dirty bathroom.

Vthis is a welcome addition to the ever blossoming food scene that is pittsburgh and now lawrenceville. after many years of being told that lawrenceville was the "next shadyside" but without the cost it seems that this may finally be occurring.  sure there is many points of view with respect to gentrification... oh wait... this is supposed to be a food review not a sociological diatribe...sorry...so, we stopped here last night around 730 after i read a quick blurb from china millman in the post.  it seemed like my kind of place with unique food and tapas style dining.  it's on 35th st. on butler street a few blocks from where butler turns into penn.  the front is a very nice gated courtyard with plenty of outdoor seating.  there wasn't anything available out front so we were seated inside.  there is an upstairs with a deck i believe, but didn't get a chance to try that out.  we were greeted quickly by a young asian guy (alan i think?), who was nice enough to complement me on my "super size my foie gras" t shirt (wrong on so many levels) and he seated us in the back in a small open type booth with some 20 somehting hipsters next to us.  there are two bars on your right as you enter the first is more of a liquor bar and the second is a longer bar that is more of a sushi and yakatori (bite sized marinated beef, chicken, etc.) type bar.  as far as i know this is the only yakotori joint in the city.  perfect for you no carb nuts.  the lighting is dark and intimate and the feel is slick and contemporary.  annie said it reminded her of places in nyc when she was there for years in law school.  the server greets us quickly.  he's a young hipster whose name is ian.  we take some time and order our drinks.  annie has a stiff vodka/tonic and i get a little more adventorous and try the tamari-tini on the rox tasted like a manhattan to me but made with plum wine.  we start by ordering what seems like a ton of skewers (the name on the menu, but definitely fashioned after japanese yokotori.  don't get fooled by the cost they are about $2 each, but you only get about 2 bites from each one.  we tried the chix, beef, shrimp, clamari, mushroom and quail egg wrapped with bacon.   they were all served with a chimichurri, ponzo butter, and ginge dipping sauce.  the ponzo was the best sauce.  the chicken, mushroom, shrimp and calamari were all good, but forgettable.  the quail egg wrapped in bacon was by far the best and the beef was also really good.  i also tried there take on ceviche, trying the white tuna, salmon and octopus.  again cheap price, but very small portions.. the ceviche is served with peppers, onion and cilantro on a tiny piece of toast.  the sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the seafood and this was a bit of a miss for me.  the fresh seafood should be the main attraction, with just a hint of the acidity from the citrus.  i then ordered 6 raw oysters and an oyster shooter.  these were japanese oysters and served on a lovely plate with some fish eggs, but for me they just didn't stack up as well to other domestic oysters i enjoy.  the oyster shooter was not that good either.  it was served in a cocktail glass half full with this overpowering sauce.  i guess i was just expecting a shot glass with vodka, and tobasco.  finally i had the pork belly entree.  this was really good.  spicy braised pork belly, beautifully plated with perfectly cooked pearl potatoes.  we shared a piece of delicious chocolate cake almost flourless infused with cayenne pepper from "dozens" next door.  it was really good.  i was impressed with the service and overall experience especially since they've only been open two weeks.  this is a good new addition and i'm sure if i made some better choices it would have earned four stars.  i'll be back again.  one last note keep in mind it is easy to spend $100 on dinner for two here even though many items are only a couple bucks, because of the portion sizes.  i prefer to eat many different small interesting bites, so i don't mind... but, these are not traditional "pittsburgh" portions.

Vinteresting if only for the crowd; trendy 30-40s, which seems absent from most of the places i've seen.\u000a\u000ai don't know if i'd call it fusion; they have some latin items (ceviche), and some asian items (sushi), but not everything is necessary a mix of the two.  i didn't expect the sheer variety on the menu, and was really pleased by it; the sushi is good enough that i'd be happy just having it, the skewers - whose name escapes me right now - were delighting the couple sitting next to us.  \u000a\u000athe entrees were actually the least impressive part of the meal; 3 stars there.  the desserts were absolutely phenomenal, from a deep friend banana cheesecake to a green tea, bean curd, and coconut icing cake with 10+ layers to it.    easily 5 stars on the dessert; i'd leave another restaurant to come here again for a final course.  \u000a\u000agreat happy hour specials, apparently.

Vi like tamari - it's hip, young, and has lots of interesting dishes.  the atmosphere is fun, and i like the crowd - it makes me feel like i'm somewhere other than pittsburgh, which on some nights, is a real plus.\u000a\u000athe chef has some really inventive dishes on the menu.  i personally am not a huge fan of their ceviche, as i think it is too bitter.  but then again, i am not a huge fan of ceviche in general, so who am i to judge?  but, you read my reviews because i judge, so that's my opinion on that.  certainly i think the ceviche could be improved by using a different platform - the current cracker thing gets soggy within two seconds and is not tasty at all.\u000a\u000athe robata grills are fun and always perfectly cooked.  i recommend getting the sampler if you're with a group and splitting, so you can try a little of everything.  consistently good ones are the bacon and quail egg, and the salmon.  the chicken is also pretty good too.\u000a\u000aof the entrees, my favorites are the lamb lollipops and the pork belly.  the lamb lollipops come on a bed of sweet potatoes, which is a great complement.  the pork belly can't help but be delicious, since it's essentially a big slab of tender bacon.  yum.  \u000a\u000atheir sushi is also quite good and gives all the other japanese places in pittsburgh a run for their money.  it's fresh and reasonably priced, and you don't have to deal with obnoxious south siders (*cough*nakama*cough*).  try the tamari roll and the tnt roll.\u000a\u000ain general, always try the specials too.  they have some really good ones.  the only reason i'm not giving it full stars is because i consistently feel like the sizes are too small for the price.  i know the quality is high, so the portion sizes are justifiable, but... it always bothers me, just a little bit.  but not enough to keep me from coming back.\u000a\u000aoh, one more tip - sit at the bar by the kitchen if you can.  i mean, just try it out at least once, if you come multiple times.  watching them cook is a real treat.

Vso far tamari is the best restaurant i've been to in pittsburgh since moving here from san francisco in august. it's a fusion asian/spanish place with swanky decor, extensive cocktail list and delicious aroma filling the entire dining floor from their open kitchen. \u000a\u000awe started with sushi for appetizers: spicy tuna roll and something deep-fried with shrimp. and it was ok... spicy tuna wasn't spicy and i'm just not a fan of tempura no matter how great it is. but! the next part of my meal was absolutely 5-stars: pork belly with tiny roasted potatoes and spicy sauce. followed by a macademia nut, white chocolate cheese cake - yum!

V4.5 stars.  one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh and one of the best representations of what a fusion restaurant should be, but it's just not quite 5 stars for me.\u000a\u000afrom the appetizers, i've tried their grilled romaine salad, peking duck quesadilla and tempura soft shell crab.  of their entrees i've tried their chilean sea bass, lamb lollipops, their bento, and braised pork belly.  i've tried all their "robatas" or skewers.  for dessert i've tried the green tea cake as well as the white chocolate cheesecake.  let me just talk about the most notable ones.\u000a\u000athe peking duck quesadilla brings together the concept of the peking duck wrap with the popular quesadilla.  think of your basic cheese quesadilla and add shredded peking duck to the mix.  it's served with hoisin sauce for dipping and sliced serano chili's for a bit of heat.  personally i love the idea of a peking duck quesadilla, but i would have preferred the large sliced of duck typically found in duck wraps instead of the shredded duck in tamari's iteration.  also, i'm curious as to why executive chef roger li opted to not have the peking duck's signature crispy skin a part of the dish.\u000a\u000athe tempura soft shell crab was an aesthetically pleasing appetizer that fed the eyes more so than it fed the stomach.  the lightly fried soft shell crab was cooked perfectly and was served alongside kimchi that spiced up the dish and also added a textural contrast to the tempura.  the presentation was absolutely beautiful.\u000a\u000aall of the skewers are delicious, but the most notable one would easily be the bacon wrapped quail egg skewer.  each skewer is served up with three poached quail eggs that burst with flavor when you put it in your mouth and just let the "pop" melding the overtones of the bacon with the soft interior of the egg.  the last time i went, one of my companions actually ordered four skewers of the quail egg for a total of 12 eggs altogether.  other ones i liked the most include the beef tenderloin, the shrimp, and the shitake.\u000a\u000afor entrees, the lamb lollipop is probably my favorite main dish followed by the braised pork belly.  the lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare and served alongside a mashed sweet potato, which was a beautiful textural pairing.  the braised pork belly is braised in five spice and served alongside a cucumber salsa and pearl potatoes.  i love braised pork belly, so i was super excited to see it on the menu.  my only gripe?  the pork belly was around the same size as my ipod nano (3rd generation, the ugly square one).  the cucumber salsa was delightfully crunchy.\u000a\u000atheir green tea cake is easily my favorite dessert.  i absolutely love all things green tea and i really like how the cake itself has a really strong "tea" flavor component.\u000a\u000ai'd recommend going during their 5-7 pm happy hour special when you can order 1 dollar skewers.  also, be sure to grab a seat by the open kitchen; it's super fun watching all the chef's cook.  also, if you drink, be sure to try their take of the dark'n stormy.  it is absolutely a delicious drink.  better yet, ask the bartender to serve you the root liquor on the rocks.

Vwe will start of the review this way\u000a\u000awas tamari good: yes\u000awould i go back: yes\u000a\u000anow let's discuss why it does not warrant a 5 star rating\u000a\u000awhile first ignored when we walked in by the server that was there and the bartener the hostess came back and seated us promptly. service from that point on was excellent and professional. \u000a\u000aambiance was nice, new and chic but it was still a cramped 2 story shoe-box building, they did the best with what they had but not an optimal setting for this type of restaurant. if you enjoy watching your sushi made you are out of luck if the put you upstairs which is where they seem to put people who come in to dine while the downstairs appears to be for the partiers.\u000a\u000ain these types of restaurants it's best to sample as much as you can and we did, we ordered two items from the small plate portion of the menu and these were the two most disappointing of the evening. \u000a\u000athe duck quesadilla was rather flavorless, while it had a nice portion of duck it was bland as if poached in liquid removing most of the duck flavor, the rest of the quesadilla was equally as bland and it was served with a hoi sin sauce that was cloyingly sweet and not a good combination. the other item was the chicken spring roll which was overly greasy, the contents was ground seasoned chicken which made it slightly untraditional in texture. the sambal served with it was good and went well the jalapeno salsa seemed an afterthought used mostly for color.\u000a\u000afor an entre we tried the beef tenderloin, perfectly cooked, served on chipotle whipped potatoes that had very little chipotle flavor to them. overall this dish was good but we noticed that many entrees were served on these potatoes plated the same way, with just a few variations in sauce and accompaniments.\u000a\u000athe robata grilled items were seasoned very well and could be eaten without the dipping sauces which was a good thing, for all three of the sauces were just meh and need some improvement in taste and texture. \u000a\u000awe also tried some regular sushi and a specialty sushi, i am not a sushi aficionado so i gave them 5 stars since we both enjoyed the maki very much.\u000a\u000ai think tamari does best on the asian side and not so good on the latin fusion side.\u000a\u000asmall plate: 2.5 stars\u000aentre: 4.5 stars\u000arobata grill: 4 stars\u000asushi: 5 stars\u000a\u000afood total: 4\u000aservice: 5 stars\u000avalue: 4.5 stars\u000aambiance: 3.5 stars\u000a\u000agrand total: 4.25

Vok, so i wasn't sold on tamari being the best restaurant in pittsburgh, but over the months, i've come around, and can safely say that tamari is most certainly one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh, if not the favorite (point brugge being right up there).  but now that i've had the chef's tastings, i can't go back to being lukewarm - this place is phenomenal.\u000a\u000aand word seems to be getting out too - i've come on mondays, tuesdays, wednesdays... it's always hopping.  so, i hesitate to spread the word more, because one always likes to keep some places secret, but seems like the cat is out of the bag on this one anyway.\u000a\u000ai can't say enough about the chef's tastings - getting to see the food prepared right in front of you, and getting stuff that they are testing for the next menu changes... it's all great.  and what's more, i'm always stuffed to the gills by the end.  i mean, i may have harped on portion sizes before, but holy cow.  they make sure you go home with a full belly on the chef's tastings.  totally reasonably priced too!  \u000a\u000aso, tamari, a tip of the hat to you.  i don't often change my mind, but you've done it.

Vsome dear friends of ours gave us a gift certificate to tamari before we moved to pittsburgh, and we were just waiting for a special occasion to use it.  since i just got a new job and passed my licensure exam, yesterday was the day to celebrate!\u000a\u000awe found easy street parking right across from the restaurant (at 7 pm on a saturday).  the place was not crowded when we got there, but it filled up quickly and was packed by the time we left!  we were seated upstairs, in a small area of the restaurant with about 8 tables, and a long bar.  the decor was pretty simple, but chic and streamlined.  it was attractive, but i felt it was lacking something - that extra quality that makes me feel like i've been transported somewhere special.\u000a\u000aour waiter was extremely friendly and articulate, and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  he helped me select my cocktail, the herbin' blues, which contains gin, elderflower liqueur, blueberry, thyme, and lime.  it was a beautiful and tasty drink - the only bummer is that it wasn't very big!  served in a regular size martini glass, but the booze didn't come up nearly to the rim.  that's just a shame!\u000a\u000awe decided to go sharesies on everything, so we started with tapas:  yucca fries, pulled pork tostada, and empanadas.  the yucca fries were very tasty - they looked the same color and size as fast food french fries, but when you tasted them they were extremely crunchy and clearly not a potato!  they were *really* crunchy, almost could be described as "hard," but perhaps that is how they should be.  we both liked the creamy yuzu aioli served alongside the fries.  the empanadas were very tasty - instead of the usual crust, they were served in a flaky croissant crust.  the meat inside was hot and hearty, and the dipping sauce for the empanadas was a red coconut curry sauce - tasted just like a thai dish.  a great example of how the latin meets the asian.  the pulled pork tostada was good, though by the time we got to it, it wasn't that hot anymore (temperature-wise).  the pork was juicy and the meat itself was flavorful, but i didn't get a whole lot of flavor from the sauce.  every now and then the jalapeno provided a kick.  i wish the tapas had been served in succession so they didn't cool off - we didn't get to enjoy each one at it's best temperature.\u000a\u000athen we had some sushi - the tamari roll and the hako.  the hako was pressed into this really interesting rectangular cake-like shape.  great flavor and the fish was impeccably fresh.  the tamari roll was also very pretty and colorful, and had a nice kick from the chipotle mayo.  the rolls aren't terribly big: 4 big or 6 medium pieces each, but the fish was creamy and the flavor was right, so i think it was worthwhile.  \u000a\u000afor dessert we shared the churros, which were served with avocado cream and fruit.  the fruit seemed to have been frozen - it had that unmistakable taste (at least in the berries).  the churros themselves were good - hot, cinnamonny, a bit doughy perhaps.  we were full on three tapas, two rolls, and dessert, so an entree wasn't necessary.  the bill came to $92 for all that plus 2 cocktails, so our $75 gift card was much appreciated.\u000a\u000awe agreed we'd like to come back in fall and try more tapas.  we overheard a waitress saying they'd be changing the menu for fall, and i'd love to taste what they offer!

Vfancy atmosphere but the food is not all that great. good? yeah.\u000aspecial?  not really.  \u000atrendy?  you bet. \u000atamari  is overhyped in my opinion, it highlights all the "sexy"food trends but doesn't really make a niche for itself

Vi would recommend going to 61c, areefa's or coffee tree roasters if you're in squirrel hill. all of these locations have better tasting coffee and atmosphere.

Va comfy coffee shop with a funny barista and a tasty chai latte.  that's pretty much all i can say.  not being a coffee drinker, it's hard for me to rate them on that front.  on a sunday afternoon, this place was a study hub - i came to catch up with a friend and i felt like we really had to keep our voices down.  i often see people studying in here, so this may not be the best place for a raucous chat, but then maybe it depends on the time of day.  but it was a nice place to spend a few hours on a cold fall day!

Vtotally nondescript place to stop and get one item you may need.  it's a bit unsettling when you walk in here.  by that i mean it smells.  i'm not sure what the smell is, but it's not a good smell.\u000a\u000aanother thing that i cannot figure is why is there only four pumps at this gas station when it is on such a big lot on the south side.  smack dab in the middle of the other two gas stations that i'm aware of, each on an end of the south side.  weird.

Vi can't believe i'd never heard of this place before, let alone eaten here.  i work catty-corner from it, so i must have passed it before.  but anyway, since i was too lazy to make lunch this morning, one of my co-workers suggested she and i order from here.  we had a flyer lying around the office, so we figured why not?\u000a\u000aoh boy, am i glad i tried this place!  the subs here are very reasonably priced and very tasty.  i considered getting the pastrami and swiss sub, but then i remembered how much i like the pastrami at my favorite place in squirrel hill.  i was afraid it wouldn't measure up.  so i played it a little safe and got a 6" italian sub.  the sandwich was a typical ham, salami, and pepperoni with fresh veggies.  the meat didn't have that "process-y" taste that some other sub places do.\u000abut it was very tasty.\u000a\u000athey also have toasted subs, salads, and pizza here too.  the help here is very friendly and efficient.  i will definitely be back.  maybe next time i'll even try the pastrami.

Vthe lady and i have very different opinions of this place, however i believe it would be intellectually dishonest for me to give the 2 stars she so vehemently believes they deserve.  so, in deference to her opinion let me quite upfront with what she deservedly does not like about the place.  two words... "no substitutions".  now, if you suffer from the affliction of being a picky eater...first, my condolences...secondly, you know the need to have some control over the food presented to you.  this is not an option for kevin sousa's menu at yo moma,,,woops! i mean "yo rita".  the other issue is that the bartender was less than expected and made a drink that sounded delicious on the menu nearly undrinkable.  the space itself is quite pleasant.  there are high ceilings, a big bar to the right, plenty of tables.  your appropriate amount of hipsters and yuppies (and i'm using these terms (including this yuppie) in the most unflattering sense possible.  there also are some interesting candles and what looks like copper artwork on the wall.  here is what i really like about the place...."the food".  i don't know of anywhere in the burgh' where i can get such interesting tacos as "freshwater eel", soft shell blue crab" or "chicken livers",,, for a "foodie" (another word i despise!) the ability to have simple street food reinvented with interesting ingredients is a bit of a revelation especially when cooked properly, which for the most part these were.  i had the chicken livers taco which was served on a flour tortilla with shredded cabbage, perfectly season and flavored fried chicken livers, bacon,,, lemon garlic aioli and guava (although the guava was barely noticeable).  this was $5 and was a nice portion of my first chicken liver taco,,, another first was the duck taco.  the duck was cooked perfectly medium, think of the best piece of juicy moist duck breast you've had with a little crispy skin and this was that.  however, imagine wrapped in a tortilla with fresh cilantro, jalapeno and a nice fig chutney.  annie was able to eat the chicken livers, but that was about where her dining experience ended.  if the service was a bit better, the drink prepared properly this may have earned four stars. it may even deserve 3 1/2 stars now but that's not an option.  i'll be back and i look forward to chef sousas' other venture in garfield (i think?) if he can ever get it "off the ground".

Vthis is an unusual and unique spot: high-end tacos with bizarre ingredients crossed with a bar which always seems to have penguins games playing... \u000a\u000athe tacos are all served on flour tortillas from reyna's in the strip; the best tortillas in pittsburgh, but i wish yo rita offered corn. last time i went, i had a calamari taco which was too salty and an eel taco which was just right. the chips and salsa are good too. decent beer menu, although i asked for an ipa in the bartender somehow managed to convince me that the stout was really an ipa (it wasn't). ;-)\u000a\u000aother random notes:\u000a1. i wouldn't really call this place mexican -- it's more like mexican inspired. \u000a2. it's extremely loud inside (just from people talking), and it's often hard to get a table as the place is quite popular.

Vlately, i think the tacos here feature too many fried foods, and are over flavored. didn't enjoy them nearly as much on the last two visits. also, the place is incredibly noisy inside to the point where it's hard to talk to your table-mates.

Vi started writing this review months ago and have noshed here several times...so why am i just getting around to it now,  you ask. i guess the words i would use to describe the fare here just elude me. yo rita's is just transcendent! everything (pertaining to the food) is flawless. taste, quality ingredients, flavor profiles, creativity, and presentation  all exceed my expectations.\u000a\u000aon my most recent visit, i ordered the velvet underground which consisted of beets, goat cheese, i believe arugula and some other tasty things. it was delicious but the beet/goat cheese combination is a little played out. on the other hand, it has great flavor and they do up perfectly at yo rita's. the other taco i had was the asparagus tempura - divine! it was paired with ponzu, ginger mayo, mushrooms and what really gave it that ummph was the toasted black sesame seeds, those tiny things pack so much goodness!\u000a\u000ajb ordered his go-to, the chorizo (he'll order anything that has a fried egg on it) and the trout per our servers suggestion. he was pleased with both and happy he took the advice.\u000a\u000athe only area that has room for improvement would be service -  it's not terrible but it certainly has its issues, but when the food is consistently amazing i'm inclined to overlook lacking service.

Von relatively short notice, having never dealt with her before, laura came through and took excellent care of our pet while we were gone. \u000a\u000afirst and foremost, she comes over preliminarily to assess your dog, what he or she likes, how he or she behaves, etc. you run her down on all your specifics - where the food is, when to feed, should she take them to the bathroom pre- or post-walk. her rates are reasonable, somewhere around $10-$15 per visit - each visit is about 30-45 minutes(depending on your dog's needs) and includes a bathroom break, a walk(weather permitting), and some quality time(in our case, accident cleanup). \u000a\u000awe were fortunate enough, shortly before leaving, to have a family member step up to spend nights with our dog, and laura had no trouble changing her schedule from 2 visits to 1 on short notice. she also kept us updated with a short text with every visit.\u000a\u000aif your dog is ok to stay on his own overnight, i definitely recommend giving the pet nanny a call.

Vdozen's cupcakes are okay. this location is super small. more than six people and it's really crowded! i have had much better cupcakes at oakmont bakery. i do really like they're brownies though!

Vthese two stars are for the interesting flavor combinations, but to be completely honest, the cupcakes are overpriced and dry. i keep going back hoping that this time will be different from the last - maybe i got a bad batch or something - but no i always feel disappointed in the end.  \u000a\u000athis review is for the murray ave. location, i have never been to the one on butler st. so can not comment on it.

Vthis location is now closed. \u000a\u000ano business seems to make it on liberty avenue. big mama's house of soul is gone, chick boutique is gone, the cordon bleu culinary school is closing, the august wilson center is having money issues and now dozen is gone. if sweetlix closes next i will be pissed!\u000a\u000ai wasn't a fan of their dry, stale cupcakes, but i never like to see a downtown business fail. we don't have much there now.

Vhow i have never been to this bar until last week is beyond me. it's 0.1 miles away from home! so there is something good that came out of this snowmageddon of 2010, at least for me ;)\u000a\u000ai was impressed by the huge beer selection they have, there are a few taps (5 or 6) and 3 huge fridges with bottled stuff at the end of the bar. unlike some other places i've been to, here they print all the bottled beers in a menu; so it's easy to see what they have and made your pick. i've also tried an appetizer here, fried pirogies with sour cream, they were tasty but that's as far as i made it into the food menu (they do offer lunch, dunner and even brunch now)\u000a\u000athey also have darts and shuffleboard, and a big tv to watch lakers games on. and if that's not enough, fridays are $4 margaritas and they are huge. this saturday they had a 21a beer tasting, rogue tasting earlier this year. all in all, pretty amazing for a bar so close to home and the prices are obviously lower than southside (and the crowd a ton more bearable)

Vhough's bar is another one of those neighborhood joints.  i can remember years ago when it was kind of rough at times.  it was closed and then bought out by another couple who upgraded the place.  my husband went here recently with his railfan buddies.\u000a\u000ai've been here a couple of times too.  as i recall, they pretty much have standard bar fare here.  it's mainly appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers.  the burgers here are pretty good.  they're mainly huge, half-pound behemoths, but for those of us with smaller appetites, they have a decent 1/4 lber.

Vthe food you can probably make at home - it's pretty basic pub grub. i like going during the week when it's not so crowded. i've been there once on a weekend and it was too crowded for my liking. if you plan on going to see a stillers or pens game, go early or it's standing room only.\u000a\u000athey have great specials and an incredible beer selection. i was really excited to see the beer menu with descriptions and origins! i was going to give hough's 3 stars but i threw in an extra one simply because they offer samuel smith's organic mixed berry!!!! and the bartenders have always been helpful and kind.\u000a\u000abeware!! if you want a 6er to go, they charge by the bottle. a 6pk of that ss mixed berry set me $45 a bit pricey but so refreshing and so worth it.

Vfrom the outside you think hough's is going to be totally smokey and gross inside, with nothing but miller lite on tap. you're a little scared by hough's. then, one day, you throw caution to the wind, and walk in. as a serious, collegiate beer drinker, you immediately fall in love. all you've wanted in a bar is here. a single tear falls to the floor.  \u000a\u000ahow could i list all the things i love? i will pare it down to 10. \u000afirst of all, it's family run, and they family is full of nice people. i mean, who wants to frequent an establishment run by a family full of jerks? not me. they always swing by to chat me and hubby up, by name. secondly, there is a wall of taps. third, they have great prices, and there's always a special going on. fourth, no smoke! fifth, a wall of taps, sixth, they have tvs with sports, but i wouldn't call it a "sports bar." seventh, the interior is nice, and not at all cheap or worn-down. eighth, ninth, and tenth (drum roll) wall o' taps!!

Vi have never in my life dealt with such arrogant employees at any type of establishment. i've heard stories from friends and acquaintances about rude or lack of service and on one occasion i witnessed bartenders giving patrons attitude, but always giving the benefit of the doubt i thought maybe it was a bad night or whatever. recently a few of my friends and i went for a couple of brews after work, it was around 1am. at 1:45 we ordered a round for last call but were informed that they already had last call. thats odd, we were seated at the bar and none of us have a hearing impairment and it wasnt noisy. when my friend mentioned that no one heard it we were verbally assaulted (i wont go into detail, it was a rather lengthy exchange and recounting that night is making my blood boil) by the lovely female bartender. she also informed us that they are closing early because "we close when we want. if you don't like it leave and dont come back" we were told. and then one of the awesome male bartenders finely spoke up only to call one of his paying customers a prick because he said "fine. we wont."\u000a\u000ayes, this is how they treat they're consumers. i dont care how many beers you boast, no establishment in the service industry has a right to treat their customers in this manner. im ashamed to be the dutchess and i wont step foot in this place again. they've made it abundantly clear they dont care about returning customers.

Vthis salon isn't much to look at, but i didn't go because i wanted to be in a "spa environment."  i went because i wanted a cheap pedi!  $20 is nothing; the ladies here do great work.  they are meticulous and take their time.  i was here 45 minutes.  i have paid way more elsewhere and been less satisfied.\u000a\u000athey do get busy, and i had to wait a while before someone could see me.  make sure you bring cash for a tip--they take cards, but only for the base price of the service.

Vi was debating between 6 different thai restaurants i had bookmarked on here, and ended up going with the cheapest one.  i'm so glad i did, because i think i found a new favorite.\u000a\u000aas previous reviewers have mentioned, it is tiny, but i didn't feel too cramped.  our server was very nice and friendly and the food arrived very promptly.  they were out of thai iced teas, but we ordered thai samosas ($4.50 for 4), a massaman curry minus the peanuts ($9.50), a coke ($1.50), and a chicken pad thai ($8.50).  the thai samosas are delicious - the filling is creamy and the cucumber sauce is great.  the massaman curry was pretty good.  i thought the rice-curry ratio was good, and there were good chunks of potato and tofu, plus peas and carrots.  i thought it could have used a touch more flavor.  the pad thai wasn't bad but wasn't the best.  we ordered it with a spice level of 8, which seemed pretty accurate.\u000a\u000awe didn't order desserts but they were $5.  they offered fried bananas, a taro custard, and two other which i can't remember.  our total was $25.  we are both eager to come back and try some more dishes on their menu.  byob.

Vwhat a cute place!  we would never have come here if not for the yelp reviews, so good job on that one, yelpers!\u000a\u000ai'm not sure what they do in the winter, because this place is tiny.  the amount of outdoor seating is equivalent to the amount of indoor seating (which is probably somewhere around 10 people per space), so make reservations if you know you're going.  the service is fantastic - they are so friendly!  it feels like a real neighborhood restaurant, which it is - totally tucked around the corner off negley.\u000a\u000asome of the food was good, and some could have been better.  we started with the crispy calamari and steamed dumplings, both of which were fine.  i think we wished that there was a little more calamari than there was.  we then shared the pumpkin curry, pad see ew, and green curry.  hands down, the pad see ew was the best we'd had in pittsburgh, definitely on par with green mango, and potentially even better.  however, the consensus around the table was that the curry dishes were not as good as those at green mango - they seemed a little on the watery side.  perhaps not enough coconut milk (some of them specifically that they are not made with coconut milk, so there's that).  mainly, they just didn't seem as... "taste"y as others we'd had before.  also, the pumpkin was a touch undercooked and was tough.\u000a\u000abut we loved the fresh mango with sweet sticky rice dessert, perhaps even more than the fried banana dessert with ice cream.  this is all to say, we're happy to have found another good thai place in town, and the service is just so cute that we'll have to keep on going back.

Vamaaaazing!! the place itself is tiny and so adorable, service is exceptional - a rarity these days, and the food is fantastic! we started off with samosas which were light and flaky with perfectly spiced filling and accompanied with a sweet and tangy cucumber sauce. i had the green curry and the bf had a noodle bowl, both of us were pleased with our dishes, veggies were bright and cooked just right so they held their firmness, my tofu had a good consistency, and justin enjoyed his chicken immensely, and spice levels were pretty on point. we both ordered a 9 and it was just enough heat to make us sweat a little without making our noses run or tongues burn to the point of not being able to taste all that delicious food. nothing on the menu is over $10 and portion sizes won't let you leave hungry. we can't wait to back!!

Vnot only the best thai food i've had in pittsburgh, some of the best food i've had in pittsburgh. split the thai samosas with a friend (wonderful!) and had one of the curry bowls. rather than try to describe the food, i will only say that it's excellent. you absolutely must try this for yourself.\u000a\u000aas a bonus, prices are very inexpensive for the quality & the atmosphere is welcoming and intimate. byob.

Vsmiling banana leaf's thai is out of this world. on the inside they have a handful of cramped tables, and (not?) surprisingly the outdoor area on the sidewalk is just as crammed, as our group of three attempted to sit at a small bistro table for two. the day was wonderful and i called ahead to ask if they would mind my dog joining us, and they said it would be fine.\u000a\u000athe waitress is extremely friendly when we come, but she is usually falling over herself when there is a rush as it is usually only her to manage the tables and a girl at the front to manage the take-out service. we ordered some dumplings, red noodle curry(6 spicy, $11), mango tilapia(8 spicy, $13, and pad ped telay(6 spicy, $13). we also got a steamed dumpling appetizer($5) and a thai iced tea($2) while we waited. when the waitress brought out the dumplings, she also brought along a to-go container with water for my dog.\u000a\u000athe dumplings were decent, but the sauce that came with them, a sour, sweet sauce with a hint of soy and lemongrass was delicious, i could have poured it on everything. our food came out quickly, the red curry was a humongous portion, a large bowl filled with vegetables and noodles and up to the brim with a delicious curry sauce. it was decently spicy for a 6. the mango tilapia was quite sweet, and extremely tasty. well fried and not overcooked, the only complaint about the dish was that for being the highest spicy level of the group, it was the mildest(aka a 0 on a 1-10 scale).  the pad ped telay was my favorite, great flavor and a lot of spice. i was stealing a bit of that dish by the end of the meal. we also got a fried banana, which comes with ice cream and a delicious caramel cinnamon sauce, and three small fried spring rolls full of banana.\u000a\u000asmiling banana leaf has some of our favorite thai in the city and its well worth the trip up, just be aware that the place is small and there is often a wait. if you live in the area, take-out might be just as good of an option.

Vsmiling banana leaf, i love your food, but you won't get your 4 stars back until you give me the spiciness level i ask for. i know an '11' can beat out 'medium' store-bought salsa, i know it can. \u000a\u000ait seems like every time i go, i order a higher level of spice, and the dishes get milder.

Vmexico city you may be my new go to mexican joint in the city.  i'm very happy to have found you and based on the line you are a secret no more.  ray and i wanted to take advantage of the relatively nice weather (42' and cloudy) and go for a quick walk.  a client of mine had told me about this place and was pretty adament that it is the best authentic mexican in the pittsburgh area.  we all know the usual spots (el camp, ray azteca, etc.).  however, i hadn't heard of this place.  the place is pretty convenient.  head down 6th and make a left on wood st. about a block away.  the relatively small storefront hides a surprisingly large restaurant.  we walk in and there is a line at the door and almost every table filled.  the place is pretty massive with a big bar in the middle of the area and small rooms tucked away on the sides.  we were lucky enough to find a spot in one of the nooks after only a short wait.  the place looks like you would expect, colors and decorations just like anywhere else.  the corner rooms are nice however because the one we were in had a plasma and a couple of couches in addition to a couple tables.  the tables are a little too close together and don't provide much privacy when it's crowded.  i suggest if you're going for lunch to go after 1 pm.  waitress greets us quickly and is very friendly and they all seem genuinely filled with glee at their packed restaurant.  she brings over the tortilla chips which are okay albeit not warm and lacking a little salt.  she comes back pretty quickly and we place our order.  i was told the guacamole is a must have, so we order it and it arrives pretty quickly and the guy prepares tableside.  it's a big morter set and he asks how hot we like it.  we like it spicy, so he puts a bunch of jalapeno, cilantro, citrus, etc... and it's super delicious.  maybe the best i've ever had.  now, my only complaint is that it's a bit overpriced.  he used maybe 1/2 of an avocado and it was good for only a few chips worth.  plus, much of the avocado was lost because it was in the crevases of the morter.  however, it's worth getting at least once because it really is good.  ray, gets the chefs quesadilla which was okay, nothing too interesting and quite frankly a little bland and maybe a smaller portion than he would have hoped.  i get three tacos.  they have a two taco special for $7, but they had so many options i had to try more than two.  i order the lamb taco, which is good braised lamb served with cilantro and rice.  i also order the chorizo taco, which is certainly my favorite.  the sausage is spicy and flavorful and works well with the small soft tortilla shell and the flavor of the rice.  lastly, i tried the chicken with pumpkin seed (?) sauce which was okay...actually, i was expecting a more bold or interesting flavor.  my only other small complaint is that it was close to an hour between the time we ordered and ate our entrees'.  i can see giving this place four stars in an update in the future.  i'll come when it's not so busy and work through the taco list to find ones i love.  they have about a dozen options and i'll try everyone.  i will be back.

Vi went here with jessica m. the other night while in pgh. the place was really loud due to the steelers game on the tv. unbearably loud really. the seitan tacos were most excellent. the chicken soup was huge, but i could barely find any chicken in it. the two drinks i had were strong and tasty. i loved the dreadlocked lady bartenders. one has a really neat tattoo of a bridge outside of pittsburgh. i will definitely head back here the next time i'm in pittsburgh hopefully when the weather is warmer so i can hang outside on the patio.

Vthe menu is inspired, the food is tasty, cocktails are boozey. i left feeling somewhat unsatisfied though.\u000a\u000ajb and i went for lunch and each had a bloody mary (it was* okay*) for starters we had chips with salsa and guacamole. chips were a tad greasy and the accompaniments were good but not extraordinary. my quesadilla and jb's tacos were both delightful. jb also got a side of grilled green onions which had a nice smoky flavor but i couldn't eat too many at one sitting. all that + 20% tip cost $52.

Vvintage decor? check. noise level? perfect. ambient lighting? ideal. guacamole and salsa? excellent. chips? fresh, but extremely oily. fish tacos? delicious. margaritas? quite drinkable. best pollo verde tacos in the city, hands down!\u000a\u000ai'm lowering my rating to four stars due to their extremely oily chips which i have learned to avoid. this unfortunately makes it impossible to enjoy their excellent salsas and guacamole.\u000a\u000aps: the tacos come on dual layered corn tortillas. this is apparently quite a difficult concept for other pittsburgh restaurants to grasp.

Vi first discovered round corner cantina because it's the place everyone goes while waiting for a table at piccolo forno.  round corner has a lot to say for itself in it's own right.  the food is very good and it has a really cool vibe.  i do agree the service is often a little slow.  not crazy about the smoking on the patio.  but despite these flaws, round cantina is a fun place to visit and enjoy with friends.

Vi had a great meal at the round corner last night, and the service was excellent, so i am extending an additional star.  the tacos are delicious and they make some of the best margaritas in pittsburgh.  i love the patio seating, it's a great place to take friends.

Vomg, the happy hour actually is happy!\u000a\u000aas if you couldn't tell this was my first visit here.  and what better of a time to go than happy hour on a friday?  drink specials and free chips and salsa!  the pitcher of margaritas is a great buy during this time compared to the price per glass.  \u000a\u000alet me go back to the beginning.  when we walked in we were greeted by the doorman who promptly asked for id (thank you, i feel young again!).  the door did state that no one under the age of 21 is allowed entry.  the lighting was dim, the room cozy with a sign pointing to the patio (watch the steps), and the aroma upon entry was amazing.  fresh mint everywhere!  made me want a mojito, but i stuck to my guns and had a margarita.\u000a\u000athe patio area is amazing and huge.  self seating so you can find your own spot that you think will be the best for your dining experience (note, the patio is smoker friendly, which is rare to find a place that is friendly to their smokers).  the thing i liked most was that after the first delivery of water, you are free to go and refill your own glass, not saying that i did, but honestly with as busy as they were, you didn't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to come by for a refill.  as stated before, i had my pitcher of margaritas and my friend opted for a pitcher of xx amber.  both at happy hour prices are a great buy and also a great thing to help pass the time.  \u000a\u000awe didn't just come here for the libations, but for the food as well.  i had the potato rolled tacos and my friend opted for chile relleno.  both looked good but i can only tell you how mine was.  four rolled and fried tacos filled with potatoes, for an irish boy like me that has a huge love for mexican food i was in heaven.  the tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole.  i'm not talking about those tiny dollops you get from a fast food chain.  this amount stretched across the four tacos and was a thick line of goodness.  but that shouldn't overshadow the chipotle sauce or queso fresco that also topped the tacos.  a serving of fresh pico was also on the plate, but off to the side so you could scoop as much or as little on top of it all.  the most amazing/surprising thing on the plate was the fried rice.  this is not your typical fried rice.  think chinese with a twist.  the rice had the typical corn, peas, and carrots in it.  but i also came across small pieces of potatoes and chicken and i'm sure there were other items in there, but i was too busy mixing everything on my plate at this point.  \u000a\u000athe prices are a bit steep here, but don't let that deter you, it's well worth it.  to say that i will be back here is an understatement.  i think this may be my new favorite mexican place in the city.  i'm so hungry for it now that i have written this review.

Vnot fantastic, but not bad.\u000a\u000asalsa was good but needed a little more heat - we added a few drops of the hot sauce on the table, which helped.  i had 2 cheese chile rellenos, which most restaurants cover with red enchilada sauce.  here, they were covered with diced tomatoes, pineapple, and something else - green olives, maybe.  the breading was a little thick and tended to overpower the flavor of the chile.  the chiles could have used a bit more cheese.  on the side, instead of rice and beans, these come with rice and steamed baby carrots and broccoli.  i thought the veggies could have used a little more time in the steamer.\u000a\u000aoverall, i felt like they were trying to make a healthier twist on chiles rellenos, which is nice, but i kind of like them covered in sauce and oozing cheese.\u000a\u000aother minor gripes: they were out of plain pepsi - only diet and mountain dew.  they only take visa, not mastercard.  the atmosphere was a little quiet and subdued.  i think this place is ok but i wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.  coupons available on their website.

Vfinally a real casino in the city of pittsburgh! i went on opening day and was surprised it wasn't more crowded. one thing i don't like is that all the good machines (star wars, sopranos) etc. are in the smoking section. the inside is really nice for a non vegas casino especially the different bars and steak house. the buffet line was insane! i did okay on the penny slots. make sure to sign up for the player's card. they put free money on your card every couple weeks to gamble with and it also lets you park in the garage for free. it doesn't help that it's takes 15 minutes from my driveway to being parked and sitting at a machine. you might see me there tonight!

Vawesome, fun, and different, pittsburgh bars and barely existent club scene only get you so far. when you're getting bored of your usual haunts, cross the river and you can gamble! and watch old ladies and men with oxygen tanks play slot machines. \u000a\u000asure, it's no vegas or even reno but you also don't have to fly anywhere. parking is free and valet is available. great way to spend an afternoon or an evening.

Vbetter than a lot of the casinos in vegas imo. my only gripe is that its 95% electronic, i'm not keen on the table games being computerized but what can you do. i like the decor, it's more classy than gawdy.  the buffet was pretty good...highlights for me were the mac and cheese, salad bar, rosa salad from the italian section and the entire asian bar (delicious hot & sour soup). the staff was just kinda blah... the man behind the asian counter was very personable, he was the only one to actually engage people in conversation. i know you're there to eat and not socialize but a hello and a smile go very far in my book. skip the dessert section, i sampled a cannoli, baklava, and a mini caramel apple martini, i took a bite from each and that was it...there was no flavor at all.

Vfor my 200th review i guess i shall delve into the casino.  let me start by saying that i'm not a huge fan of any casino.  in fact this was the first time i visited in over three years.  so why would i consider stepping foot into the casino and then proceed to write a review, well let me tell ya.\u000a\u000ai came to attend an event at the drum bar located within.  i was unaware that they were able to accommodate special events here.  i really don't want to go much into the drum bar right now because that will be another review later.  i was pleasantly surprised to see that there is much more to do at the casino than just gamble.  so much so that i didn't even notice the slot machines for a majority of the night.  \u000a\u000awith a different variety of foods at the restaurants throughout it's easy to find something to please your palate.  everyone raves about the buffet and i would be one of those people too.  tons to choose from, even if it's a bit pricey, it's still worth it.  gift shop located inside as well.\u000a\u000athis place is also nice to just walk around in.  it is a very wide open place and doesn't feel like you are trapped inside.  the views of the city are amazing, you get the right angle and you get a spectacular view of downtown.  and the view of the west end and mt. washington isn't too bad either.\u000a\u000ai may have to come down here a few more times to experience all the other places to chill out at.

Vi finally made it to the rivers casino. its clean, modern and classy. i lost $10 in one minute on the penny slots. it happened so fast i can't believe it actually happened at all. there is a smoking and non-smoking section, but there are so many smokers and the entire area is filled with cigarette smoke. parking is free and so is pop and coffee.  this is a really nice place to hang out if you're a senior citizen and/or have money.

Vabout the best thing i can say about subway is that my tastebuds will never be offended by flavor when eating there.  and i mean good or bad!  the thing is, subway is just so bland at best.  and it seems like they have no quality control over their restaurants.  this subway seems to be one of the better ones, meaning that it's bland.\u000a\u000aso what was i doing eating here yesterday?  a friend of mine came to visit me for the weekend and i had no time to do any grocery shopping.  plus, i had to go do a home visit as part of my job, so i needed a quick lunch.  quick and bland.  believe me, although it wasn't horrible, the italian bmt sub is far from an italian sub.

Vactually good ceviche, delivered, and not expensive. i had little home made corn nuts with mine the first time, which were perfect with it, none the second time, which made me sad. the burgers and fries are just as good, if not better than five guys.\u000a\u000astar lost for inconsistent delivery, not actually having great chicken, and never giving me those corn nuts again.

V(fish) chicharrones! \u000a\u000aso they might not be the pork kind but they're still tasty. we ordered through campusfood, i've never been to the actual restaurant. the chicharrones came with 2 sauces, one spicy guac. and one sour cream-y, and a nice helping of plantain chips - all around $10, big portions

Vi tried out pusadee's after stumbling around chowhound one day looking for new restaurants to try out.\u000a\u000asince we had no idea what to order, we asked the server for recommendations.  he suggested their pork meatballs as an appetizer and said it's all about the special noodles and fish.  most people end up getting their street noodle #1.\u000a\u000awe ended up getting their pork meatballs, which were absolutely delicious.  i want to say the meat was minced by hand with a tad of baking soda for it to achieve such a fine texture which remind me of the meatballs at chinese dimsum places.  the seasoning was right on spot; i've had too many under/over-seasoned meatballs to take small things as the proper amount of seasoning for granted.  they come skewered on sugarcane which added to the presentation and were fun to suck on while we waited for our entrees.\u000a\u000ai asked pusadee what her favorite dish was, as opposed to the most popular dish.  she first noted that i might not like it b/c it's spicy but told me it was the spicy tilapia.  i love spicy, and i ordered it.  my friend ordered their street noodle #1.\u000a\u000athe spicy tilapia dish was a lot larger than i had imagined; it was five pieces of fried crispy tilapia with a copious amount of the spicy sauce.  the sauce itself wasn't that spicy, but it had lots of strong thai flavors with a sweet touch from caramelized onions.\u000a\u000ai tried some of the street noodle #1 and it was pretty good.  the thinly sliced crispy chicken wasn't as crispy as i would have imagined, but all the flavors were spot on.\u000a\u000asome finishing notes:\u000a\u000awhat i found interesting was that i didn't see anyone in the restaurant order curry at all.  and pusadee and the waiter didn't recommend them either...\u000aget reservations.  it's a small restaurant and the first thing we were asked was if we had reservations.\u000abecause it's a bit further away from the "hot spots" of pittsburgh, parking was ridiculously easy.\u000aif you want to try the tilapia, get a friend to order something else and split the two dishes.  it comes with no vegetables and asian cuisine is all about splitting dishes anyways.

Vthis was a cute little thai place i would definitely go to again. food quality was as good as any i've had at other thai places in pittsburgh, but this feels a bit more off the beaten path. very small inside.

Vwe came here on a sunday evening in summer, on a double date with some friends.  we made a reservation, but there were a handful of tables to spare for walk-ins.  we were seated outside in their garden, which is a lovely patio decorated with little lights, and covered in flowering plants.  it feels secluded and private, and it's easy to forget that there are other patrons around you.\u000a\u000awe brought two bottles of wine, which our served opened for us - even brought us an ice bucket for the white wine.  it's only $1 a glass to byob which is a pretty sweet deal.  service isn't speedy, but it's definitely at a relaxing pace.  you have time to swallow your appetizers before your entree shows up, and nobody slams the check down next to you when half of your pad thai is still on the plate.  gotta love that.\u000a\u000awe started with the grilled pork meatballs - four of them come skewered on sugar cane and they are delicious!  juicy and succulent and flavorful.  they didn't come with a "dipping sauce" as advertised, but there was a little bit of sauce drizzled over them, so maybe that's what they meant?\u000a\u000afor my entree, i got the spicy duck noodles at a level 5, which ended up being the perfect spice level.  it was definitely spicy, giving my mouth a kick, but i wasn't sweating and gasping and diving for my water glass.  i'd get food at a level 5 here again next time - i like being able to feel the heat without my taste buds getting too numb to get the other flavors.  the duck was tender, the broth was savory, and the noodles were slurpable.  not much veg in the dish, but it was very tasty nonetheless - super fresh, and i actually finished the whole thing!  i ate it so happily that i didn't have even remember to taste my boyfriend's massaman curry, which he said was delicious as well.\u000a\u000ai think pusadee's and kanok are really on par with each other - great, fresh thai in a beautiful setting.  worth the money for sure.  it's several steps above your average thai takeout, and i hope we'll return to pusadee's again before the summer is over - that outdoor patio is just fantastic!

Va friend recommend pusadee's garden at a recent yelp gathering.  i've heard nothing but positive things, so i went tonight to try it out.  the restaurant lived up to their excellent reputation.  our spring rolls were marvelous, with lots of thai basil and fresh ginger.  i had the yellow curry, which was delicious and my son had the pad thai, also great.  the garden is an absolutely charming place to eat, very cool and shady, even on a warm day.  i will definitely be back.

Vafter discovering nikki's thai up on the north shore, we were beginning to think that we were tapped out on finding more good thai food in pittsburgh (a shout out to smiling banana leaf and green mango). and then we found pusadee's garden, and are happy to add it to the list.\u000a\u000athey have a great garden in the back, and the food is very good. as other reviewers have mentioned, the service is on the slow side, but if you are not in a hurry, it's worth the wait. we had the pad see ew (very good... some of the better tofu i've had in a while) and a veggie pumpkin curry, which was also delicious. everyone enjoyed their order.\u000a\u000athe variety is not as great as you might expect, but what they do, they seem to do well.

Vwe went here last night and i was eager to try the reincarnation of the old "richard chen" which closed a few months ago after it's highly anticipated and well documented opening a year ago.  this decor remains essentially the same as its previous reincarnation which is good, because i find the space perfect.  it's sparse and crisp with super high ceilings and minimalist decor.  the wood is dark and there is a new addition which is a relatively large sushi bar in the middle of the dining room.  i still think the bar is a little small and certainly not a bar meant for lounging or eating.  this is the second attempt at asian cuisine more suited to the pittsburgh pocketbook.  we had a reservation for 730 pm and arrived a little early without a problem grabbing a seat.  there were a few empty tables when we arrived, but none when we left.  i wasn't too pleased initially when we arrived, because we were sat in my estimation at the worst table in the place.  it's a small two top against a wall near the sushi bar with heavy "traffic".  it took about 20 minutes for our server to arrive at the table and while i did appreciate her apologizing for the wait we found ourselves waiting for drinks, etc much of the rest of the evening.  i'll chalk it up to a new restaurant trying to find its rhythm.  we started with our drink standards...annie with a vodka/tonic and me with a ketel dirty rocks.  the vodka/tonic was not good.  my dirty martini lacked olives and much flavor at all.  i also tried the tomio sake, which tasted pretty good, but was served in this tiny like bellini glass and was a very small serving for $7.  we started with a couple appetizers.  annie ordered the chicken satay which is served with a peanut dipping sauce.  this was a pretty good dish, the chicken was moist the sauce strong, but not overpowering.  paying homage to my west indian descent i ordered the roti canal.  roti is a type of flatbread used with almost every meal in india and much of west indies (caribbean).  i consider myself a bit of a roti conneoisseur (sp?).  i'm pleased to say this was quite good.  it was warm, soft and buttery.  the curry sauce was pretty good, a bit thicker than i'm used too but good all the same.  and, both apps' were only $6 and $5 respectively.  annie ordered the general tso's chicken and they were able to accomodate her request for only white meat.  it was fine, nothing memorable and certainly the healthiest version of general tso's i've ever tried in that it was breast meat and it wasn't fried.  i'm always eager to try a new sushi place, so i wanted to sample a good amount of the options.  i was happy to hear that everything on the menu was in stock...too often i find restaurants with expansive sushi menus only to find out they are missing the most interesting items.  i started with the sunomono which is a seaweed salad with cucumber and shrimp.  the seaweed was flavorful, but the shrimp was lacking flavor and not much of a portion.  i next tried the spicy tuna on crispy rice.  the ricecakes were what you'd expect i guess...bland, flavorless.  the only reason i ordered this was so i could add the quail egg ($1) to the mixture to increase the richness of this already rich mix.  the tuna itself was good and the two raw quail eggs were a fun addition and the quail egg was presented well on a foundation of wasabi.  i would of liked to order a very large selection of sashimi, however you could only order the sashimi in 6 pc .portions so that would have been a rather expensive ($10-$12) choice if a sampled a wide variety.  not that the $10 is expensive for 6 pieces, i just would have prefered to pay $5 for 2 pieces and tried a wider variety.  i settled on the salmon sushi and the "fatty" salmon sushi.  these were both quite good and prepared properly.  i really couldn't tell the difference between the fatty and normal salmon, most likely just a way to get the consumer to spend a buck more on the fatty option.   overall the food was pretty good.  i'll probably stop back if i'm in the area to work my way through the rest of the sushi menu, however even if the food was 3 or 4 stars and the prices reasonable.  our table wasn't good, the drinks were pretty bad and the service while friendly was slow.  hence, the reason for the 2 star review.  i'll give it another shot soon and hopefully update wth another star or two.

Vgoing to plum is mainly about going for the ambiance.  first thing i noticed as i walked in on a friday evening; i was about 20 years younger than the average age.  most of plum's patrons appeared to be of the baby boomer generation, with some older and some younger.  anyways, on with the food.\u000a\u000awe split a south beach roll as a starter and for entrees she had a chicken and asparagus and mushroom stir fry while i had their pan-seared duck breast.  the south beach roll was interesting; it was hollowed out cucumber slices with tuna, white fish, avacado and tobiko.  i'm use to the more traditional methods of having sushi (sashimi / nigiri), so the crunch of the cucumber replacing rice was definitely different.\u000a\u000athe chicken and asparagus stir fry is what you would expect the dish to be; thinly sliced chicken stir fried with chopped asparagus in a basic sauce (soy + corn starch).  although it is a pretty basic dish, i do have to give them lots of credit for cooking the chicken to optimum doneness; it was tender and juicy as opposed to your typically overcooked chicken.\u000a\u000athe seared duck breast didn't meet my expectations.  i expected well, a whole duck breast that had its fat rendered out and was seared.  i guess for me, hearing seared implies not cooked well-done all the way through.  anyways, what was served up were five fatty duck breast pieces smothered in sauce.  duck is a fatty animal, and thus when it's cooked, the fat is typically rendered out so it doesn't overpower the protein/rest of the dish.  unfortunately, even though the duck was juicy, all i could think about the entire time was the excess amount of fat.  i would have also liked a tad bit less sauce overall.\u000a\u000awith a drink each, our total came out to be around $80.  don't get me wrong, i don't think plum is a miserable place to be, just for me personally there are other restaurants that serve up food more in line with my taste at the same or even a lower price point.  for me personally, i might head to plum if i'm trying to impress someone who cares more about ambiance over food.\u000a\u000ai know plum has a lunch menu as well; i'll update my review after i try them out during the day.

Vso much hate for wine loft! i had a good time here, we came with a bunch of kids from school, overtook one of the curtained-off sections (great when you have more than 3 people with you, you can actually have a little hangout spot) and kept ordering sangrias until we couldn't remember. actually that last part is a lie, i stuck to whiskey that night. \u000a\u000asome people in our group ordered a couple of their specialty cocktails - they looked good and tasted pretty well. i didn't try any food but it doesn't look like a food kinda place. maybe a little expensive for pittsburgh but after living in sf, didn't faze me.

Vblue dust features a large selection of decent beers, an appealing and clean atmosphere, pleasant service, and good food. they have a large draft list written on the blackboard which changes frequently, as well as coolers for you to mix and match your own sixpack for a reasonable price. the waiters have always been extremely friendly, and the bar has a laid-back dark cool relaxing atmosphere. ps: non-smoking!\u000a\u000athe fish tacos were amongst the best i've had in pittsburgh and the china doll appetizer was superb. they also have decent chips and salsa, a great portabella mushroom wrap and ginger carrot soup. on my last visit i had a delicious beer called the "duck rabbit milk."

Vi'm surprised no one has mentioned the selection of infused vodka that is available. the horseradish used in the horseradish vodka is harvested by the owner of the bar and is the perfect accompaniment to a bloody mary. my boyfriend tried the thai chili vodka in his bloody mary (it was good but it'll make you sweat). there is also a kumquat vodka which is popular in martinis and even bacon vodka (a venturous friend of ours tasted it and said he was quite surprised that it was actually very good) \u000a\u000athe beer selection is wonderful! too many to choose from? ask the bartender for a sampler and tell them what you like (fruity, hoppy, lager, wheat) and they'll give you 4 different selections. \u000a\u000athe food is really tasty but i must admit that last time we ate there, my boyfriend and i were both disappointed. he had the brisket (which is smoked with apple wood by the owner) sandwich which he raved about since blue dust's grand opening and i chose falafel, which i've had once before. the brisket was chewy and fatty and my falafel is supposed to come with tzatziki sauce which they were out of but our server neglected to tell me, the dish was extremely dry so i boxed it up and took it home then put my own tzatziki on it. \u000a\u000awe're convinced that the quality of the food has suffered since its grand opening. back then, the family that owns/runs blue dust were involved with everything- they bartended, took orders, cooked in the kitchen, entertained, etc... now they have hired wait and kitchen staff who aren't as invested in this family business.

Vi've been meaning to get here and try their food for some time and i am quite happy i finally got the chance. the menu isn't that big, but the selections are great to choose from.\u000a\u000awhile browsing over the menu to pick out exactly what i wanted to nosh on i had another hard decision to make: what to drink?  they have so much on tap that it's boggling to pick from. 27 i believe. if you're not sure what to try, you can purchase a sampler. for this particular visit i wasn't in the mood for a beer and decided to go for the hard stuff. now at any typical bar this would be an easy decision to make, but this is not your typical place. i mean who would thought to make a vodka infused with pickles?  or horseradish even?  i wasn't that daring to try one of those but something did catch my eye. root beer bourbon. yes, i did say root beer bourbon. i asked the bartender what was best to mix with it and was advised to try it mixed with ginger ale. such a wise bartender you are my lady.  it tasted like a root beer float for adults!\u000a\u000anow onto the food. my friend and i ordered finally ordered after all those hard decisions.  we had the fried zucchini as an appetizer. beer battered is always the way to go. only bad thing, i think it may have been fried too long. the coating was hard as hell on some parts. i opted for the fish tacos and was not disappointed.  grilled tilapia with shredded red cabbage and a sauce with cilantro in it. delicious. have it a spritz from the lime that came on the side and that made it ever so better.  each item comes with a side of tortilla chips and salsa.  my friend had the falafel platter and she devoured it. \u000a\u000athis place definitely deserves a return visit. and not just because of the food. the staff are so welcoming that you feel the need to return.

Vi had heard about this event before, but never imagined i'd get to be there and get to play some of these games! my boyfriend and i just happened to be in pittsburgh when the papa (professional amateur pinball association) 13 championship was happening and we just happened to be eating at bocktown beer & grill when my friend said that it was nearby. so, we went and our minds were just overwhelmed with awesome. the space is huge and amazing and filled with pinball machines everywhere as far as the eye can see. since they only open for papa championships and special events throughout the year, you should be watching their website like a hawk. never before have i seen a space that dropped my jaw this low to the ground. this is a pinball wizard's dream!

Vwhat a cool place to see a rock show!  i saw cursive here last night, and i felt like i was back home!  we bought tickets at the door, and right after that, the gm came up and introduced himself and shook both of our hands.  (maybe it was because i was wearing a nebraska shirt and he thought i was with the band--but seriously, how often does that happen at a venue like this?!)\u000a\u000athe bar inside is a-plus.  they have so many options, everything from hard liquor to wine to 100 kinds of beer bottles, as well as a small (but impressive) draft selection.  the floor was "open" that night, so 21+ could bring alcohol out to the stage area, but 21- could not go back to the bar area.  (judging from the crowd's cheering, i don't think that's always the case, and sometimes if you're drinking you're confined to the bar.)\u000a\u000athey also have a patio bar and grill set up outside the theatre, for pre- or post-show hanging out.  the grill is actually really good, and gregg, the chef, has a super sweet mustache.  bonus points because he makes his own hot sauces; i highly recommend the symphony of horrors.\u000a\u000athe acoustics are not the best ever, but it's not like you're coming here to listen to the ring cycle.  it's a rock show!! and it's a good one.

Vthe beauty of walking is you get to see all the small hole-in-the-wall joints you typically miss if you're driving around.\u000a\u000at & k's soul food does both take out as well as dine in; most people tend to get their food to go.  my friend and i both ordered their rib dinner which consists of 4 rib bones, 2 sides and cornbread.  i chose mac 'n cheese and collard greens for my sides and my buddy got mac 'n cheese and mashed potatoes.\u000a\u000aribs were super super super meaty and tender.  they were lukewarm, which shows they were cooked ahead of time, but ribs do take time to cook.  i would've preferred them piping hot though.  mac 'n cheese was super super super good.  i love mac 'n cheese and i mean the real thing; sorry kraft.  the collard greens were pretty standard; not amazing but not bad.\u000a\u000afor 12 bucks it's definitely a pretty sweet deal.  for me it's 3.5 stars and i'll definitely be back to try their fried chicken.

Vi had a cheesesteak sandwich here and it was soooooooo good. the place is small, the menu is hand-written and i felt a little awkward but it was totally worth it. they also have an impressive selection of pies (!) which i didn't have enough cash to try :( the sandwich was huge, impossible to eat without getting down and dirty in it, overflowing with green and banana peppers and mushrooms and grilled onions and cheese. their fries are also great - they're the thick, steak kind.

Vthe lady and i went here last night kinda on a whim'.  we've been meaning to check out the new casino and figured on a tuesday night it shoudn't be too busy and it wasn't.  we got there around 7 pm and pull up to the valet (which is complimentary with a players card-which is free), so i see no reason not to valet.  the entrance to the casino itself is quite grand especially for pittsburgh.  i won't spend a lot of time describing the casino except to say the crowds were okay, probably a little better than mountaineer.  i was able to find a blackjack "table", which is with a video dealer, but i had just as much fun and won enough to pay for dinner x 2 in about 30 minutes and annie found some nickel slots.  there are mulitiple restaurants from casual to fast food to their take on "fine dining".  we tried the "fine dining" option which was andrews.  it's a very lovely place.  inside there are high ceilings, ornate lighting, big bar with a friendly bartender and plenty of tables/booths.  however, what i really appreciated was the outdoor seating.  we were able to sit right on the railing on the sidewalk on  a gorgeous early fall night.  i like how the trim of the huge casino changes colors and during the early evening it was quite beautiful.  we were greeted quickly enough by our main server "bill" who was working in conjunction with "joya".  overall they were pretty good and i've been told jobs here are a hot commodity, so chances are your server will be a professional.  we started with a couple drinks.  i had a dirty martini, ketel one, rocks...which was quite good, however annie wasn't as lucky with a weak and sour vodka/tonic.  we started with a couple appetizers.  i ordered a half dozen oysters, which were surprisingly good.  i think you're typically not suppose to order oysters this time of year, but bill said they were from nova scotia, so i guess it was alright.  they were plump, fresh and briny.  it was served with a pretty forgettable mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce.  we also tried the "hot off the rock" more of a novelty item than anything else.  it's servedon "volcanic rock" and you cook the meat yourself.  they serve it with a trio of sauces and it's tuna, beef, chicken and ahi tuna.  it was fine and kinda fun, but taste wise no better than anything you'd get at any hibachi around town.  they had a very nice selection of bread served warm with good quality butter and hawaiian rock salt (big fan of hawaiian rock salt, refer to tomatoe mozz review at the carlton).  the two person table was a bit small for this beginning, but we made do.  i guess i suggest if you want to order some of the bigger plated items like the hot rock and oysters, maybe have them serve one before the other.  annie had the sirloin (12 oz.) with mashed potatoes.  the steak was a bit overcooked and the mashed potatoes were good, but not capital grille or ruth's good even though they were charging ruths' prices.  i had the king crab which is technically considered with them an accompaniement, but at $40 that would be one hell of an add on.  the portion itself was large enough and the crab was cooked well, and they did crack them for me.  however, when i spend $40 on "king" crab legs i expect monster crab legs these were closer the cheaper snow crab version.  i added on for $10 the trio of sides of which i picked the mushrroom fricassee (okay, but not flavorful), onions (forgettable) and au gratin (quite good).  most of their  entrees are served with sides except steaks and certain seafood like lobster.  overall i found the quality good, but not deserving the $200 including tip with two drinks each it cost me, not including dessert.  if i go back i'll try to go for the cheaper lunch or hopefully by then be getting 'comped'.  again, not a bad place with good service but definitely not in the same atmosphere as capital grille or even hyde park.

Vthis is easily the best pizza in oakland. almost the perfect slice, save for some very minor issues with the cheese/sauce ratio, and mozzarella without even a little saltiness. all of this can be remedied with the shakers of salt, pepper, garlic, red pepper, (good and salty) parmesan, and oregano. the slices are huge.\u000a\u000athe only other place in pittsburgh that comes this close to the platonically ideal slice is italian village in squirrel hill. ivp doesn't serve beer though, and definitely doesn't offer a make your own six pack with actual quality beers.

Vi would give this place 5 stars if they had a dryer. they have a no-touch drive-through car wash that costs $5-8 and it's great and makes the inside of your car smell like shampoo. but, it leaves you soaking wet.\u000a\u000aso bring your towels! \u000a\u000aor if you're feeling extra productive and energetic, you can hand wash your car here too

Vcity cafe is unique and unexpected.  i highly recommend reading a few reviews before you go, so you know what to plan for.  i had a wonderful, quirky brunch experience here a week ago with a good friend who'd been there before, and loves introducing other people to the delights of the city cafe.\u000a\u000aparking is actually free right in front of the cafe, so that's a plus.  we walked in (on a saturday at noon) and it was totally empty.  i know this seems like a bad sign, but just bear with me.  the owner greeted us immediately - he is host, server, barista, cook, and conversation all in one - and served us earl grey and coffee in large mugs.  he asked if we were ordering food - he is a fantastic cook, but he also really values the fact that this is a cafe, and food is optional.  but we were hungry, and came for his cooking.  i ordered the huevos rancheros, and my friend ordered the brazilian peasant breakfast.  he disappeared to cook it, and we sipped our drinks.  in this time, another customer appeared and sat at a table.  the owner did not emerge from the kitchen.  she left within 10 minutes, without having been greeted.  i feel guilty, like i should've explained it to her.  this is how the man operates - he runs the entire show - and sometimes you will need to wait.  if he doesn't greet you, he's back in the kitchen cooking.  if you want to order food but he's making a cappuccino, then you need to sit tight.  he said he couldn't afford to hire a server - i think it's a vicious cycle where he can't hire someone to serve, so service is slow and people don't come, and then he doesn't make enough money to hire someone.  people just need to come and be leisurely!  have a little patience!\u000a\u000aour breakfasts were served in small baking dishes, straight out of the oven.  the accompanying tortillas and baguette were soft and warm, served with butter and jam (and, i think, hot sauce for me).  my eggs were marvelous.  deliciously soft, with a runny yolk.  the potatoes, onions, and beans underneath were toothsome and creatively spiced, in a rich, warm sauce.  for such a large meal, it felt light in my stomach afterwards.  it made me happy - fed the soul, if you will.  \u000a\u000aall the food here is vegetarian.  it is also hearty and inexpensive, as well as prepared with skill.  as the only people in the cafe, the owner chatted with us a bit about his future plans.  he does have an unusual conversation style - sort of, excited and talkative with an odd turn of phrase - and he has very strong opinions about what matters in our culture.  he clearly values quality, freshness, patience, and you need to feel that way too in order to come here.  don't come here for a greasy breakfast, or if you want to get in and out in 30 minutes.  come for a cup of coffee in a sunny room, a homemade brunch, and some memorable conversation.  prepare to stay a while.  but please do try it - help the man hire a server, for goodness sake!

Vwildcard is one of the coolest shops selling handmade goods i've ever been to. leave it to pittsburgh to be on par with paper doll, my go to place for cards in chicago. the selection is really varied. on my visit, a woman was looking for a christening card for twins. i'm pretty sure the owner rebecca was able to scrounge up something that met the woman's criteria. how specific of a request was that?\u000a\u000athe space is really roomy and it's a comfortable store to browse without feeling cramped. being a maker of paper goods myself, i ended up buying cards. whoops! there are lots of gifty things perfect for many types of people. i will be back the next time i'm in the 'burgh.

Vawesomely quirky is quite adequate to describe this place.  from the moment i walked in i couldn't stop looking around.  i swear a half hour was spent in there just browsing before i decided to make a purchase.\u000a\u000ai think i may have been over stimulated in here at one point.  it's a very awesome store that has pittsburgh themed items from clothing to post cards.  i'm definitely going to have to go back when i have time, and more money in my pocket to pick me up a few of those shirts.\u000a\u000ai ended up getting a card and an awesome gift for mother's day here.  made it easy to do with all the quirky items to choose from.

Vbumping this up to five stars.\u000a\u000ai recently stopped in looking for a card for a special occasion.  after browsing the selection on the shelf and not being able to spot the perfect card i asked the employee working that day if there were any cards that had a cupcake on them.\u000a\u000athe employee did a quick search on the racks and showed me one i overlooked.  wasn't impressed by it and as i stood there contemplating whether or not i was really going to purchased that card, the employee was busy doing a search.  the employee went to where they store cards.  the employee pulled out the perfect cupcake card and saved the day.\u000a\u000aas i was paying and about to leave i just had to let them know how much i enjoyed their store and helpful they are.  ever so humble, the employees thanked me and just reminded me to keep coming back.

Vi am a member of the carnegie museums and i particularly love going to the museum of art.  they have a couch that sits right in front of a huge monet "water lillies," and that's one of my favorite spots in pittsburgh.  there's lots to see, paintings, sculpture, furniture, photography, architectural exhibits and more.  the special exhibits are great to visit, as is the permanent collection.  i would recomend the carnegie international, a marvelous modern art exhibit at the carnegie that happens every 5 years.

Vthis is the closest coffee shop to etc where i go to school and on rare occasions when i get a few minutes off, this is where i run to get my coffee fix. they have a nice selection of super sweet coffee drinks and your basics: latte, mocha, etc., free wifi, pastries, and when the weather's nice they open the big glass garage door in front.

Vcall me crazy but i just don't approve of crazy mocha's appearing on every street corner. the coffee is good but not great. i can buy a bag of flavored coffee and brew it at home. i've had better lattees and specialty drinks.

Vbecause i can't give it 3.5 stars, i rounded up to 4. the map room offers upscale barfare that strays from the burger and fries standard and is very tasty indeed. it's a nice place to go with a group of friends or to enjoy a lovely dinner for 2. outdoor seating is a plus, however it is limited and it can get crowded on weekends. i've heard they have live celtic music one night a week which i'd like to catch sometime.\u000a\u000aif you're in the area or d's is super crowded, walk next door and give the map room a try.

Vthe layout of this macy's leaves much to be desired.  this major design flaw kept me away from the waterfront macy's for a while, but since figuring it out, i've made some great finds.  my advice is to get a macy's card, and pay it off every month.  with the macy's card you get quality coupons mailed & e-mailed regularly that can be used in addition to any sales they have going on.  i've never paid full price for anything there!  $600 watch for $300? yes ma'am!  $300 pearls for $80?  unpossible you say?  no!

Vi really want to like the 509 cafe since it's in my neighborhood and we need more good restaurant but currently it's just okay. it replaced elena's which was homey even if somewhat odd and quirky. the 509 looks just blah, from yellow paint on the walls to plastic plates (please get rid of plastic plates!)\u000a\u000ai had breakfast burrito... i love breakfast burritos. this one was a little weird - it consisted of two small tortillas wrapped around the works. it was not wrapped like a burrito, it did not look like a burrito. i make something like this at home because i can't do any better. past it's odd appearance, it did taste pretty good, although i didn't see any advertised sausage in there. i didn't try the salsa served with it but sour cream was very solid in it's plastic cup, probably from the fridge. \u000a\u000amy lunch companion loved his sandwich, so maybe the "burrito" was just a miss? the drink selection was good but tiny bottles of everything barely seems like enough to go with your meal (tiny gatorade, apple juice, etc)

Vi'll rate cafe 509 somewhere between 3-1/2 and 4 stars.\u000a\u000amy husband and i ventured down here on sunday morning to check it out.  we hadn't been here since they took over from elena's.\u000a\u000aeverything about this place is modest.  it's a modest little place in a modest neighborhood with a modest menu.  in fact, there are no real surprises on the menu at all.  the breakfast menu is pancakes, french toast, and variations on egg dishes.  breakfast sandwiches are $3.99 and breakfast plates are $4.99.  you can add coffee and a side for an additional 2 bucks.  \u000a\u000aso while the menu here is not as extensive as eat-n-park's, what they have is pretty good.  i did try the breakfast blt on croissant (which i admit was different and i do so loves me some blt) which was quite good.  my husband tried the french toast with 2 eggs which looked really good.  as others have mentioned, the staff is friendly and the presentation is good.  they're open for breakfast & lunch only.\u000a\u000acafe 509 won't knock your socks off, but it's a nice change from eat-n-park or denny's and it's certainly worth a visit.

Vmostly mod is a smaller retro store on 8th street. this place doesn't have a quarter of the selection of who knew?, but the stuff is a ton cheaper. we saw two retro coffee tables we liked that were in perfect condition, both were under $30. we bought a pair of couches there that were perfect to fit in the small space of our apartment and he threw in one of the tables we liked for free. also their delivery service is only $25. super friendly, super knowledgable owner - this is a great place to stop in for that hard-to-find piece of retro furniture

Vcharming little shop that transports me back in time every time i walk in. the owner is such a pleasant person, fun to talk to, and sets reasonable prices. \u000a\u000aas a collector of everything owl, i go to thrift and retro shops to seek out pieces for my stockpile. i haven't found any here yet, but i'll keep trying when i'm in the area. i have found some funky coffee table books, art, and ashtrays. \u000a\u000aif you appreciate things from decades gone by, it's definitely worth stopping in. one never knows what they'll find!

Vi've stopped in mostly mod quite a few times since i first walked in and fell in love with the pair of couches i got. bernie and drew, the owners, remember us by name and what styles we're interested in, and details about our house to recommend pieces that they have to suit our space. they're usually well-versed on the history of each item - not only it's production, but usually all the way through its life. yes, the store is still small enough to go over in a few glances, but i swear if i had a bigger home to put it in, i'd leave with something every time.\u000a\u000aafter months of looking for a kitchen table we liked(and every time we walked in, they would say 'hey we have a table you might want to take a look at') we finally found love at first sight at mostly mod once again - and the large glass-top table, 4 chairs, and delivery came to $250.\u000a\u000abernie and drew have a pretty extensive list of regulars it seems, so the good pieces sell quickly. as they dropped it off, they let us know that the day after we purchased the table, someone else had tried to buy it. the story was the same with our couches, after they were delivered someone had come in the store looking for them specifically.\u000a\u000awe stop in a few times a month to chat and see if anything catches our eye. if you're looking for something specific, ask - they might have something you'd like not being displayed.

Vone of my friends won a happy hour - or "happy evening," since it lasted from 9-11 pm - at whim on the friday before halloween.  this was our first visit to a club since moving to pittsburgh over a year ago - we're really cool - so we got dressed up and headed out to station square.  they opened up at 9, which is when we arrived, so the place was pretty empty for the first hour, or hour and a half.  since our friend had won the happy hour, we had the pleasure of sitting at a vip table, which was cozy, but there still wasn't table service.  \u000a\u000athere were some drink specials that night - i think on miller lite and effen vodka - but the drinks were weak.  once the drink special ran out at 9 pm, it wasn't worth buying any more.  the music was good, but it took a while for people to get dancing - not until 1130 or midnight, maybe?  there are 2 large rooms - one more for standing and talking and drinking, one with a big dance floor.  couches line the dance floor, which i actually kind of love, so if your feet hurt you can just crash there.  the music was pretty good - mostly songs i've heard of and enjoy - and there's different music playing in each room, so if it sucks in one room you can just move on.  also, somehow, the music was just loud enough.  you can still have a conversation without totally screaming, but your voice will definitely need to be raised.\u000a\u000awe had a fun time, and it would be a good place to go out dancing again in the future, but i'd say get your drink on at a bar somewhere else before coming here.  and you have to have enough energy to stay up until last call, since the dancing doesn't even start until midway through the night.

Vi think i'd give the schenley park cafe 3 1/2 stars if i could.  years ago, my parents tell me, you'd never eat in a park cafe like this.  mom and dad say that the food was terrible and overpriced, the facilities were rundown, and heaven help you if you attempted to use the restrooms!  o how times have changed!  \u000a\u000athe building that the cafe is housed in was, over the years, used as a tool shed, a nature museum, an office, and a storage shed.  it was closed several years ago; however earlier in this decade it was completely restored and is now a little gem of a building.  you can even rent it out for special events.\u000a\u000amy cousin and i stopped here to revitalize after hiking at schenley park.  the food here is pretty much coffehouse chow.  they have a limited menu of sandwiches, salads, desserts, soft drinks, coffees and teas.  the soup and half a sandwich looked good, but the grilled brie with orange marmalade sandwich caught my eye.  cindy opted for the goat cheese and grilled chicken salad.  the coffee was excellent.  \u000a\u000aso come and check out schenley park.  plan on spending all day to fully appreciate all the park has to offer.  then stop here for a sandwich or coffee.  the only thing is that they close at 4pm and they're closed on mondays, i believe.

Vthis has been sitting in my vault for quite some time. i was holding out to see if my opinion would change, but it hasn't. first off, i don't like the remodel. second, because everything is going digital, the amount of cds on hand are dwindling, there is not a great selection of dvds and finding someone to assist you is sometimes impossible. when you do manage to find a sales associate, they are eager to share their knowledge and give you tons of info...most of the time.

Vwith such a small selection and steep prices, i was expecting something local, organic and sustainable. the decor and style of the place definitely looks the part, down to french pressed coffee and tea served at the table. but no, they just look like it. it's a bit of a drive and isn't near anything i frequent and while i liked the decor and style, the food won't have me coming back.\u000a\u000ai ordered fish and chips, tempura style... all i could taste was flour and mush. the fish was soggy and completely without flavor. the chips were actual potato crisps (i was expecting fries, so it was a little disappointing) the best part of the meal was the veggie slaw. the ice cream and dessert did sound amazing (but then so did the fish and chips;) ). i tried a few spoonfuls of different flavored ice creams and they were quite good. so maybe it's more of a dessert kinda place? \u000a\u000aalso this is an older crowd (probably because of prices), most patrons were well over 40. i felt like a kindergardener,

Vi'm adding avenue b to my list of go-to restaurants when i'm willing to spend a little more to get fantastic food. i've never had a bad meal here, and the food is always interesting. the menu changes constantly, which is fun too. they have a stable, non-changing menu (well, it's seasonal, but it doesn't change very week), and a list of items that change almost weekly up on the wall chalkboard.\u000a\u000ai have to admit that i've never had any of their non-rotating menu options, but hear that the kobe meatloaf is quite good. because their menu changes constantly, i cannot tell you what to get, but i assure you that you'll be pleased with your meal, whatever your choice. the servers are also very willing to give advice (indeed, sometimes their opening description of the options can get a little too involved).\u000a\u000amy only complaint about avenue b is the noise level. if you come in around 5:30 to 6:30. the noise level is perfectly acceptable. or, come on a weekday. but, once the dining room fills up, it can be hard to hear a table-mate across a four top. i personally find that unacceptable, and am disappointed in the number of new restaurants in pittsburgh that share this problem (cure is another example). i understand that acoustics are difficult to manage in old buildings, but there are solutions that can be used. \u000a\u000adon't forget - byob!

Vremarkable food in a very nice space.  the mussels were cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  the pork belly lettuce wraps were excellent. i ordered the wagyu beef meatloaf because it is a "signature dish," however i did not think it was as remarkable as the other entrees i tasted.  this is a byob restaurant.  the chef seems passionate about preparing good food and the service is attentive and helpful.

Vthe best combination of good mexican food and reasonable prices that i've experienced in pittsburgh so far.\u000a\u000aat 3:30/4:00ish, there was a handful of people in the restaurant.  staff were friendly and efficient.  i ordered the chiles poblanos ($9.50).  my dining companions ordered el combo ($12.50) and the burritos deluxe ($9.95).  the chiles poblanos came out steaming hot (actually too hot to eat), along with rice and beans.  instead of red enchilada sauce on top, they had sour cream, which was interesting.  the cheese wasn't quite as melty as i like it, but they were still some of the best chiles rellenos i've had in pittsburgh.  (cuzamil's are good, but they're also $14.50 for 2.)  el combo was so big that half of it got boxed.  there was a taco, a chile relleno, a tostada, two enchiladas, and rice and beans.  the burritos deluxe were fork-and-knife affairs, since they came out covered in enchilada sauce, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.\u000a\u000athey sort of nickel-and-dime you for some things -only the first basket of chips & salsa is free, you only get 3 refills on sodas (but their glasses are huge), that type of thing.  however, there have been $5 off $25 and $10 off $50 coupons in the last two clipper magazines, and when i was googling the address i came across a printable coupon.  supposedly they have happy hour from 4-6.  they have a full bar, a good selection of mexican and domestic beers, and two big tvs.\u000a\u000anot the best mexican food i've ever had, but it's good for pittsburgh, and - more importantly - it's affordable.  i would definitely recommend coming here.

Vugh, not a fan.  first off, my husband and i had pretty awful service while the large, loud, drunken table next to us had at least three waiters pouring shots from tequila bottles at their table.  the place is pretty tiny, and i could barely hear myself think.\u000a\u000athe food was bland and mediocre, and we ordered a huge mango margarita to share.  i'm not sure if it had alcohol in it at all, and it tasted like oranges.  (maybe that other table didn't save any tequila for us.)\u000a\u000ai would recommend this place only if you are here with a large group to party.  if you want to have a nice dinner with someone, go somewhere else.

Vi was excited to discover this place as it looks promising... the chips and salsa were excellent, but the food was unfortunately only so-so. i tried the chicken enchiladas and fajitas, and while both were decent neither was worth repeating. i will probably try this place again in the future but order something different and perhaps try the margaritas.

Vlove, love, love gran agave!  by far the best mexican food in pittsburgh, and on par/above lots of mexican food i've had down south.  i've tried nearly everything on their menu, and have loved it all.  in particular, the carnitas,  tacos and quesadillas are delicious.  their food always tastes fresh, and it's not too greasy or smothered in cheap cheese.  at the bar they have a serious variety of tequilas, as well as beers; and the owner makes his own margarita mix, so no yucky neon green bottles of mix here.  for me, though, i go with a paloma every time. \u000athe one thing i would change is having to pay for the second batch of chips and dip, but i guess i can't always get what i want ;)

Vi had high hopes for gran agave due to all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. jb and i went for lunch this weekend, there were no booths available so we were seated at a table which had what has to be considered the most uncomfortable chairs ever. no cushion, just wicker. but we weren't there for comfort, we were there for the food so let me move on. \u000a\u000athe complimentary chips and salsa were good, chips were warm and not greasy. for my entree i ordered the vegetarian sopes, i got 3 of them and a bowl of rice. the rice was teetering on the dry side, but it was edible and the sopes were a bit bland but nothing some salt and hot sauce couldn't fix. jb opted for a beef burrito which he liked but wasn't blown away by. \u000a\u000athe service was slow, maybe better categorized as neglectful, our waiter walked by several times without taking our order even though our menus were on the table signifying that we were ready to order. when he finally came, he skipped us and went to the adjacent table instead. no smiles, no "thank you for coming", the waiters were just turning tables. \u000a\u000adespite uncomfortable seating and lackluster service, we'll most likely give gran agave another try.

Vthe food here is reasonably priced but it is not that good. i ordered the super quesadilla with chicken and it was bland. on the side of it there were two cups of shredded lettuce, one tablespoon of guacamole and one or two small tomato slices. i could've made something better at home. \u000a\u000amy one friend had ordered three tacos from the a la carte menu; those tacos were also unseasoned. the other friend enjoyed her chicken and bacon quesadilla. if it didn't have the bacon, i'm sure it would've been just as bland as mine. \u000a\u000aas for the waitress, she wasn't on the ball at all. she got my friend's order wrong, she didn't refill our glasses, but she made sure she promptly brought us our bills that were difficult to decipher.\u000a\u000athis was my first and last visit at gran agave. the decor is nice but everything else is overrated.

Vi can't believe this place doesn't have a review yet.  this nail salon is a totally reasonable place - they aren't high end, so they aren't super pricey, they have fast turnaround, and their jobs last a long time.  i like the people, but the reason for the star off is that they are sometimes a little too fast - i wouldn't mind having a little bit of a longer leg massage, for example.  but for the prices i'm paying, i guess i can't complain too much.\u000a\u000aif you are super conscious about cleanliness, you might consider paying a bit more and going elsewhere.  i'm not saying that they aren't clean, but they might not pass muster if you are a super clean freak.  they have a ton of those massaging pedicure chairs lining the back wall, and always have a lot of technicians around, so you won't ever wait too long.

Vshadyside nail salon is on centre and s graham by panera. parking is metered street parking, so bring your quarters if you're not walking or bussing it, ladies! actually, i shouldn't say ladies because at my last visit some dude tried to cut in front of me for his mani/pedi, but i digress.\u000a\u000athe best pedicure i've gotten in pittsburgh, and it's only $25 ($35 for mani/pedi). the staff are nice, efficient, and talented. the color selection is sufficient, and they do all sorts of fancy airbrushing and nailscaping. i think you can make an appointment, but this is pretty much a walk-in joint. tips are cash only.

Vehh.  all dunkin donuts are not created equally. this location consistently does not mix their lattes. all the syrup sits on the bottom while the espresso floats helplessle on top and its pretty hard to mix it up myself once its in that plastic cup - i've tried, very unsuccessfully. the bagel twists are hard as rocks and they don't offer veggie meats like the forbes avenue location.\u000a\u000athe only plus is the drive through.

Vordered from here last night via campusfood.  it was pretty cheap - a grilled cheese + fries, a burger + fries, and an extra order of fries came to about $15 after tip.\u000a\u000athe problem was that delivery was horrifically slow.  after an hour, we called to see if they were having trouble finding us, since our street is extremely dark.  the girl cheerfully told us that our food hadn't even left yet.  after another half hour, the food arrived but it was ice cold.  once it was heated up, it was pretty decent for the price.  i could tell that the fries would have been good if they were fresh out of the fryer.\u000a\u000ai wouldn't mind eating here again, but i think i would avoid having it delivered.

Vwhen you work 3p - 7a and forget to pack your lunch, your options are limited when you want a midnight meal. my coworkers and wanted to try something new so we ordered from here. i got an original calzone which was just sauce and cheese - nothing fancy. the calzone was very bready, that wouldn't be such a problem if the dough actually had flavor and wasn't so dry. once i cut into the thing, the dryness wasn't an issue because the sauce was so watered down the dough eventually became soggy. lacking flavor and spice, it was definitely not worth $9. my friend ordered a salad and fries which looked pretty decent, she wasn't happy with the fries because she told them 'well done' and they weren't crisp enough but she did enjoy the salad. we may give this place another try, but i'll definitely order something else.

Vjust go, for goodness sake.  this is a unique way to experience pittsburgh that will be unforgettable.  make sure you take sunglasses, a hat and a dry bag.  the rental rates are very reasonable, especially if you become a venture outdoors member.  \u000a\u000athey give you a little paddle talk before you go and help you get in and out of the water.  it's a lot less scary than you may think, as you wear a safety vest and tipping over is pretty rare.\u000a\u000ai recommend you get the solo boats over the tandems, they are just easier to maneuver and a lot more fun.

Vventure outdoors provides a wide range of outdoor trips such as kayaking, hiking, biking, nature walks, and dragon boating.  the outings are led by knowledgeable and friendly volunteers who will teach you the basic things to know about a sport and will also tell you some unique historical information about the area.  this is a great way to see the pittsburgh area and learn something new, plus it's a fun way to meet new people.  they also have a wonderful annual free festival in may that highlights all the outdoor activities, plus a number of free family festivals.

Vi love that this place exists.  a few months ago, my coworker invited my boyfriend and i to join her at a byob arcade.  a  what?  who ever heard of such a thing?  it sounded too fascinating to pass up, so we tagged along.\u000a\u000agames n'at is tucked away on an empty street, away from the hustle and bustle of carson street.  they have a small parking lot which you will be able to find a spot in, even on a weekend night.  we've been twice now and it's never too crowded - just about 10 other people around.  the prices, i believe, are about $5 for one hour, and $8 for two hours.  we went for two hours the first time and it was just a little too long.  but one hour may not seem like quite enough, especially if you've never been, so spring for two hours.  and bring your own beer!  they keep it up front for you, and it's 25 cents per beer that you brought.  they have a bottle opener there, and several games have drink holders, how delightful!\u000a\u000athere are several themed pinball machines, air hockey, a few racing games, some shooting games, classic arcade games like super mario, pac man, donkey kong, frogger, and tons of others that i'm less familiar with.  they also have skeeball which i think might cost quarters, and they have the basketball hoops where you are timed to shoot as many baskets as you can.  also there's a foosball table.  and whack-a-mole, which cost quarters, but you win tickets that you can exchange for cheap prizes a-la chuck-e-cheese.  but most of the games are free with admission.\u000a\u000awe had a great time playing everything!  it's not usually crowded enough that you have to wait, so you'll get to try most everything.  there are always a handful of games that are out of order which really sucks (we want to play star trek pinball, dammit!), but there's always plenty of other things to try.\u000a\u000aif not for the broken games, this would be a 5 star joint.  go here often and give them more money so they can fix them!

Vsurprisingly good food for such an oddly uninviting storefront. pick up order was ready within 10 minutes of my phone call, which involves silly levels of efficiency. squid salad wasn't so spicy, but was really good. sliced ginger was a little strong, but squid was actually tender.\u000a\u000alaos spearmint came with cubed chicken, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, standard veggies. not a very strongly flavored dish, i didn't think i'd ever use the word subtle for a takeout place, but it's appropriate. \u000a\u000aavocado shake was like any other avocado shake, except for a few ice chunks that hadn't been blended in all the way. really good for pittsburgh, extra points for being 2 blocks away and cheapish.

Vi came to btr on my hour break from work to get some take out, only one table had been seated so i thought this was going to be a quick trip. \u000a\u000aa very sweet older woman came over with a menu and explained some of the dishes to me. i informed her i was a vegetarian and had it narrowed down to 2 choices, the kaung pond kyaw or akitashi tofu. she told me many of the dishes can be made vegetarian so i wasn't limited to just the veggie section of the menu. well, this opened up countless possibilities for me. my eyes narrowed in on the cambodia dish which is made with coconut cream, veggies and tofu instead of chicken for $6.99. \u000a\u000anext she asked my spice level preference and i told her a 10 "oh! you like it spicy." she remarked. yes, i like it spicy and i've ordered too many 8's that tasted like 2's so i have a habit of overstating my preferences now. my order took longer than i had expected but i knew everything would be fresh so it was no big deal. about 20 minutes after ordering, the woman came up to me and very apologetically informed me that my order was made with chicken so it had to be redone from scratch. i was a little upset only because i had a limited amount of time, but i was grateful she came out and explained the situation. \u000a\u000ai had only 10 minutes to enjoy my dinner by the time i got back to work, but enjoy it i did! lots of fresh, tender veggies and lightly fried tofu were bathed in a spicy (a 10 means a 10 here!) coconut sauce. i'm sure i'll return, but i'll call my order in first.

Vi was so upset since i missed my flight so i ended up at this hotel. it was new and clean looking as soon as i walked in. even my room was in decent shape. \u000a\u000awith the marriott points i had and the disaster of the afternoon, they upgraded me to a king. there was this fancy overhead lights which dim on command. a sleeper, desk, and fridge was available. the other normal amenities also. \u000a\u000aroom service was actually from downstairs/ across the street at pizzeria unos. \u000a\u000aservice was great except for when i left at 5a and no one was in the front. i think he was busy on the internet. lol.

Vclean store and helpful employees. great selection on fragrances,  cosmetics and skin care. a bit pricey but its for quality products so its worth the cost. 2 halloweens ago i went to a party as amy winehouse and they did my make up perfectly, i didn't even have an appointment, i just asked for tips on how to do it and they did it for me.

Vnot that bad of an experience is what i keep telling myself, and that's what i'll stick to.\u000a\u000aconfusion sets in as soon as you near the place, and before you step foot in the door.  do i park on the street, do i pull in that lot that has all the confusing signs?  take your pick it doesn't really matter.  careful crossing the streets to get here.  \u000a\u000aonce inside, the confusion continues.  signs are somewhat lacking and really don't directly tell you where you need to go.  getting lost is easy in here.  majority of the time, escalators are down for maitenence, making it that much harder to navigate the building.\u000a\u000amy soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken.  at usual locations for the dmv, you walk in, take a number and sit and wait.  not here.  without a sign to indicate that you need to stop at the reception desk until you make it to the dmv portion of the floor, you have to turn around and wait in a line.  and when you wait, you get to hear the receptionist make a snarky remark about how you can't read a sign...make it bigger and put it where a person, not a dog, can see it.\u000a\u000athank god that all i had to do was get a picture taken while in here, or i might have lost it.\u000a\u000asidenote: is it just me, or would this place have been better used if it was a market to buy fresh meats and produce in.  or an indoor shopping center?

Vliving within the city limits of pittsburgh you're selection of grab and go is very limited.  limited as in giant eagle's getgo is about it.  unless you like to go to a cogos....yeah, didn't think you did either.  as others have said, i'd rather prefer a sheetz (damn you sheetz, move into the city already, ross township area doesn't count).\u000a\u000anow, onto this one.  i recently discovered this location is open 24 hours (bonus).  i only discovered this because i needed to get air in my one tire and was close and during a stroke of luck, i pulled in here.  before that stop i was at this location multiple times, even before the remodel/rebuild.  i do have to say that since they redid this place, it is nice in a few ways, and horrible in a few others.\u000a\u000athe nice part is that the inside is bigger and has a wide selection of snacks/drinks to choose from.  also there is a nice sitting area to enjoy your food made there with free wifi.  \u000a\u000athe horrible aspect is that it is on a busy street with congestion getting in and out of there.  parking is almost non existent.  and it's always congested.

Vthis getgo is always hopping, and i assume it's from customers using their fuel perks to their advantage.  the place is clean and it feels safe, but often it is so crowded there is a wait to pump gas.  the parking lot is small, so it's not that easy to maneuver around.

Vit's a bar and restaurant in the basement of oxford center, the big octagonal skyscraper on grant and blvd of the allies.\u000a\u000adecent happy hour specials, pizza, veggie wraps, and a great selection of beer for downtown; nonsmoking.  middle-tier restaurant; not a quick lunch place, but a sit down place where the food will be a bit better, but cost a bit more.  \u000a\u000aif i'm drinking with coworkers after work, this is where we usually wind up.

Vthe only restaurant we visited twice on our trip, the poutine was excellent - especially the vegetarian version with onions! it's a bit crowded and a bit loud, but we never waited more than a few minutes for a table. the taquise poutine was also very tasty, who knew that guacamole and gravy were a winning combination?

Vshort-ish line. 15 min. someone tried to scalp poutine, pathetic. others tried to cut in line.\u000a\u000athe burger is good, but not great, a little overdone. in the style and scale of mcdonalds, but obviously way better. the poutine is delicious. i had it plain, which a local told me is like "buying a corvette but not getting the keys." i enjoyed it. their vegetarian poutine is decent, the cheese is good but the gravy is very salty and tastes of condensed bullion a little.

Vi have a mixture of feelings about this place.  the decor and ambiance is pretty cool.  they have lots of seats next to a huge window overlooking market square, and there's not a lot of cheesy faux-latino decorations strewn about.  the food is  also good.  it's a little fancy for mexican, and it's a little pricy for the quantity, but it's interesting and tasty.  the service is where things go downhill.  patently inattentive and slow.  the drinks were also bad, including the draught beer.  if it was in my neighborhood, i'd probably give it another try; but since it's across town, i'll probably never go again.

Vfinally, decent mexican food in pittsburgh! by now, i thought i would never find it but las velas is hands down the best i've had in the burgh. granted, there are a few places i haven't tried yet which are supposed to be good, but for now this one wins!\u000a\u000achips and salsa were good and appeared to be homemade. the margaritas hit the spot, but the coronas strangely came without limes.\u000a\u000ai was quite pleased with the chicken burrito verde i ordered, and others in the group enjoyed their tacos al pastor and mole enchiladas. many of the tables have a nice view of the square, and the only drawback of the whole experience was the service. unfortunately, our waitress was often absent when we needed something, and i had to chase her down so we could pay our check and leave! from what i could see, the other servers were doing a better job, so this is probably just bad luck.\u000a\u000ai will definitely come here again!

Vchips and salsa are sooo tasty. a friend of mine had her wedding reception at las velas so all i really got to taste were appetizers which were all scrumptious. i'm excited to sample more, but i'll have to wait until they re-cooperate from the fire.

Vyummm!!!  i got two tacos, mexican style, which was just perfect since the tacos come with large portions of beans and rice.  the chips are homemade and amazing.  i could just eat chips and salsa here and be happy.\u000a\u000awhy only three stars?  the happy hour "special" on margaritas was $9, and they weren't very strong.  i've had much better elsewhere in the burgh.\u000a\u000abut since las velas is so close to me, i'll be back for more chips and salsa...and next time i'll try the sangria.

Vwhat an awesome place to hear some tunes.  you thought i was going to say grab a bite to eat (even if it is an amazing place to get some mexican influenced grub).\u000a\u000asaturdays seem to have turned las velas into a dance club with a latin twist.  you get to hear all the great popular dance music that are hits today, but you also get to hear the latino dance songs as well.  the part of the restaurant that overlooks market square is transformed into a dance floor and is instantly crowded.  speaking of crowded, this whole place is crowded from the time they start, until the moment that last beat drops.\u000a\u000adrinks, muy delicioso!  i have a soft spot for margaritas, and las velas has definitely found that soft spot and exploited it.  i couldn't get enough!  margarita not to your liking, try anything else here and i'm sure it'll be just as good.  full bar can never disappoint.  chips and salsa, chips and queso, can't decide, i suggest both.  \u000a\u000aneed something to do on a saturday night and are in the mood to be downtown, i strongly suggest stopping by here.

Voutstanding! stagioni is a place we must have passed countless times without noticing, on a sunday morning we were looking for a nice alternative to a greasy-eggs brunch we usually find ourselves eating. we noticed stagioni's reviews all touting the food, and looking at the menu they serve seasonal, local, and organic food wherever possible. also, the dinner menu changes daily, it seems, which i think is a great way to tell that you're getting fresh, high quality food. seeing that this place was near us and served brunch until 2, we called ahead to put our names in and headed over. \u000a\u000aarriving at about 1pm, we felt slightly silly having put our name in - the restaurant was totally empty. the walls were nicely decorated, including some art made out of wine-corks, and a bright yellow ceiling. there are about 10 tables inside and 2 outdoor seats and we took our pick. by the end of the meal, though, the restaurant was totally packed.\u000a\u000awe ordered a french press($3!), fettucini($11), 'eggs in purgatory' - eggs cooked in marinara sauce over polenta($9), and the spicy potato hash side($3). our waitress was friendly, and to echo another reviewer perfectly attentive - she was never intrusive, but even while single-handedly managing every table in the restaurant she was never gone too long.\u000a\u000aour food came quickly, perfectly portioned for brunch (my girlfriend decided she liked my fettucini too much to let me eat it, so i wound up eating half the fettucini and a little more than half of the eggs and was stuffed) and the flavors were outrageously good. the pasta was fresh, the polenta smooth, the marinara having a rich tomato flavor with fresh herbs. the potatoes were definitely my favorite thing though - just a hint of spice from red pepper flakes, fried with onions and some strips of red pepper to add a hint of sweetness. i could have eaten them as a meal alone.\u000a\u000athey are byob, but half way through the meal our server came out to us and offered us complimentary mimosas. absolutely! i'm not sure what prompted this - and as they don't have a license they can only give alcohol, not sell it - but it was an amazing touch on an already amazing meal. i am so excited to have this nearby, i'm already planning when i can go back. and the menu changes so often, i doubt i'll ever get bored of it. for anyone keeping track, we got 2 entrees, a french press, a side, and 2 mimosas for $32 after tip.\u000a\u000athey were also recently featured in pittsburgh magazine's 25 best restaurants. totally deserved.

Vanother crappy rohrich dealership.\u000a\u000ai don't know what it is about honda dealers in pittsburgh. is it that you think some people don't have the money or good/ excellent credit to make a purchase? both of which i have by the way. i just don't know. the last honda dealership i went to (valley honda) in monroeville completely ignored us while we were on the lot on a nice day with hardly any other customers. \u000a\u000athis time i went to shadyside honda in the evening hours before they closed to look at a preowned lexus suv that they have had on their lot for months. mind you i pulled up in a suv that cost double the price of the one that they were selling so they should have known that i wasn't there to play any games.\u000a\u000athe salesmen inside watched me as i parked and got out. a couple even came out to move some vehicles to their storage lot down the street. not one person asked if i needed any help. i walked the lot until i found the suv i had came to see. it was in the last row in the back of the lot. it was very nice and look spotless.\u000a\u000aso i walked inside the dealership and right by the hostess who couldn't be bothered. i made eye contact with at least three salesman who said absolutely nothing to me. i looked at about six cars waiting for someone to finally acknowledge my presence but, that never happened. about ten minutes later i finally just ask a salesmen about the vehicle i was interested in and he says, "oh, that's sold. the buyer is picking it up on saturday." i can't believe the buyer actually got enough service to buy the suv.\u000a\u000aso as i go to leave a salesmen finally asked me if i had been helped and if i needed something. i told him no and no thanks and walked out. it's funny that all of the sudden salesmen want to help me when i go to leave.\u000a\u000athis is the second honda dealership i will never set foot on any. scratch that i will never set foot on any honda dealership again! i don't care what vehicle they are selling!

Vstopped in right after they opened.  some of the booths are oddly *tiny*.  find another one if it doesn't work out, don't sit where you're uncomfortable.  they might have fixed this, dunno.\u000a\u000ai feel bad that they moved next door to another indian place... because india palace is the better of the two for lunch.  the buffet is still about $10, but the buffet here seems to have about twice the variety, and it's all pretty good.  \u000a\u000afor indian for lunch downtown, i'm still a fan of sree's, but for all-you-can-eat, this is the place.

Va bar on a friday night, sure thing, why not.  i figured it would be funny to go to blue moon during the blue moon.\u000a\u000ai haven't been to this place in a while, so of course i forgot that they have karaoke night on fridays.  i'm not a huge fan of karaoke...that is until i get a few in me and then i find it entertaining to watch people attempt their favorite songs in front of complete strangers.  maybe it's the meaning of the word derived from japanese that makes it excruciating to watch at first (empty orchestra).  after about two drinks i was able to tolerate it.\u000a\u000athe main area is a bit cramped when a show or karaoke is going on.  typical bar set up with stools around the bar.  a few tables dot the area.  hard to find a place to just stand if you don't get there early.  there is another area in the back that is more for just mingling than the front.  a couch to lounge on, some high top tables and a smaller bar that i assume when they are super busy is in use.  a small outside patio is out the back door.\u000a\u000athe bartenders were super courteous.  i had gone up to the bar and ordered another round of drinks for my friend and i from one bartender and another bartender was right there to see if i needed anything.  when i pointed to my beer to indicate that i was taken care of already he thought that meant i wanted another one.  i attempted to apologize and pay for the extra beer and the bartender refused to take my money for the second beer.  of course that meant i was double fisting for a moment there, but all was good.\u000a\u000aas entertaining as this place can be, i doubt i would be a regular here.  not a good enough vibe for me, but i will return on a sporadic basis.

Vum, it's a getgo, calm down people.  typical set up for a getgo in the area.\u000a\u000aample pumps, bigger inside area than most which means this place is always packed and busy.  convenient?  maybe, if you live in this area, but not so much when you are just stopping here to shop.  there are many places along the way when you are on the way there, or on your way out.  no need to make a special trip here.\u000a\u000anot much else i can say except traffic is horrendous to enter or exit here.  there are at least three ways, maybe four, and it's quite tricky.

Vi am so glad to have finally found good mexican food in pittsburgh!  this place is wonderful.  they have a large selection of authentic mexican dishes, and many vegetarian options.  \u000a\u000achips and salsa come gratis, and the pint margarita ($2.99 on mondays) i ordered was fantastic.  this place has drink specials every day, all day--even on weekends.  \u000a\u000ai would give them 5 stars, but the service was sloooow.  it doesn't matter, though, we'll definitely be back for the food.

Vmy best friend used to work at the emiliano's in the north hills and didn't have great things to say about the place (namely that her paychecks repeatedly bounced) so i was sort of skeptical.  i ended up being pleasantly surprised.\u000a\u000athere was no wait for a table for 2 at 6:00 on a friday night.  our waiter asked us for drinks, promptly brought them, and was great about refilling them throughout the meal.  the menu is pretty extensive, as is the drinks/dessert menu.  i was not feeling any of the vegetarian options (no cheese chiles rellenos :( ) so i did a create your own combo, as did my roommate.  i got 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and refritos ($8.49); he got a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a beef quesadilla with rice and refritos ($9.49).  we were both enjoying the free chips and salsa when the food arrived.  almost too quickly - makes me wonder if it was pre-prepared and just microwaved.\u000a\u000aat any rate, it was good.  there's not too much to say about cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, but they were good.  my roommate enjoyed all his food as well.  we ordered a fried ice cream for dessert, which was very good.  total before tip was about $28.\u000a\u000ai really enjoyed this place - it wasn't crowded, service was really quick, and it seemed like a pretty good value.  i definitely wouldn't mind coming back.

Vwe stopped in for lunch because the library wasn't open yet. \u000a\u000athe food was good. my companion had the emiliano's special which was 2 plates full of food (you get one of everything - taco, enchilada, burrito, tostada, relleno, and tamale served with rice and beans). i got a create-your-own combo which i'm always a fan of. \u000a\u000aservice was inexplicably sloooow, we were one of 5 tables seated, there was a sign on our table that advertised guacamole "hand crafted at your table!" - it wasn't. the guac itself was okay, a little too smooth for my liking, i want to see chunks of creamy avocado and leaves of cilantro. \u000a\u000athis would have been a good experience if not for the fact that we each got a bloody mary. big big big mistake. it was basically tomato juice and turpentine with a rim of salt. if you're not going to put horseradish, worcestershire, and tabasco in it, don't call it a bloody mary!! was it really too much to ask for a garnish (celery? olives? a lime wedge?) i even had to add hot sauce and salt. needless to say i had to chug it in order to get it down. oh, did i mention they were $8 a piece? pure lunacy! \u000a\u000awill we go back? probably not.

Vi was expecting better service than i received here. they have a lot of employees in the store and they try hard, but i fell through the cracks.  i showed up for an appointment, but had to wait 30 minutes. what they told me would take 15 minutes ended up 90 minutes... i think my iphone was ready, but i suppose he forgot to get back to me. you can download a store app, but it was useless for me...i advanced in in the queue, then fell behind again. the service is very uneven. i do like the displays, you can try a lot of new devices here, but wish they would improve on service.

Vcan we just call this place a beehive?  the employees worker bees?  \u000a\u000ai stopped in here to have my phone looked at as it seemed to be one of those phones that were affected by a defect.  i showed up (after setting my appointment online, best way to go about doing this) and was greeted warmly at the door.  escorted to where i needed to be and then i waited.  i was approached shortly thereafter and was on my way out the door with a loaner phone.  i was told that i would receive my fixed phone in five to seven business days.\u000a\u000ait actually took less than that.  i had received word that my phone was in fact fixed and ready for me to pick up.  i stopped back, help by the same exact person and had my phone back in my hands.  using their wifi, i set up my phone and was on my way.\u000a\u000ano problems what so ever here.

Vgreat pizza and hoagies! \u000a\u000afrank's has three locations. this one is in troy hill on lowrie street. they offer everything from pizzas, broasted chicken, chicken bites, breadsticks, pizza rolls, calzones, salads, hoagies, wraps and appetizers. \u000a\u000amy favorite pizza that they offer is the buffalo chicken pizza, chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and covered with mozzarella and provolone cheese with a side of homemade ranch dressing. yummo! \u000a\u000ai've also tried the broasted chicken, it's like fried chicken but a little different. it's pretty tasty as well. \u000a\u000amy favorite hoagie is the diablo steak hoagie, seasoned steak, buffalo sauce, parmesan cheese, blended cheese and ranch dressing. outstanding! \u000a\u000athey do deliver if you work in or near downtown too!

Vtypical qdoba location, set up is almost exactly the same as other location.  what set this one apart from the other locations is that it was able to handle the influx flow of customers that seemed to form a line to the door.\u000a\u000athey worked efficiently to make the food as fast as they could.  the guy in the kitchen area was what really made them go so fast.  it was like he knew what was going to be going out soon and had it sitting there waiting for them when they were about to turn around.  the lady at the head of the line made it a smooth process too.  she had everything set up and was on to the next person.\u000a\u000aone of the major things that i don't like is that it seems that the portion sizes have gone down since my last endeavor to a qdoba.  i got a naked burrito and the bowl it was in seems to have shrunk.  i was still kind of hungry afterwards.

Vi agree with the previous post.  how exactly do they justify the prices that they charge on some items?  specifically the idea nightstand they were charging $80 when it doesn't cost that much at the store to begin with.  \u000a\u000athe clothing selection is definitely scaled back from other store, and not marked at all, so you may think you picked up a men's shirt when you really may have just picked up a women's shirt.  no idea where to look here.  \u000a\u000abook selection is a good one.  knick knacks galore and household items are kind of awesome if you have time to pick over the stuff.

Vle mont or should i say "the le mont" like my yinzer brethren is what you would expect it to be if you are from this town.  now, if you are from out of town it is truly one of he most beautiful vistas you can see whlle dining in any city.  i've eaten here maybe a dozen times and a few years ago hosted about 30 nights while presenting seminars.  as an aside this is a good spot for business functions because it has good name recognition, professional staff and a restaurant manager who will negotiate costs.  anyways, i was here again on monday and the fact that we were there probably dropped the average age a few decades, which is fine.  this is definitely the kind of place your parents and grandparents would like.   it was a monday and at first when we were cocktailing at the bar seemed relatively empty, but actually to my surprise filled up through the evening with elegant gents and ladies wearing there sunday or monday best'.  the restaurant itself is classically elegant.  big beautiful chandeliers, lots of ornate woodwork and crystal, bold colors and a baby grand' elevated above the dance floor.  after a guinness (bonus) at the bar we were seated at a big table right on the glass.  the view was sublime, however there were a few dead flies on the inside ledge a few inches from where we were seated.  the waiter was there quickly to get our drink orders and explain the features.  he was a professional server and was pretty much spot on from start to finish.  the features of course, were seafood (restaurant trying to clear out leftover seafood from the weekend) there was a platter with lobster tail, coquille, and a few other items.  i didn't try it, but garrett and tom said it was good, i'm sure the quality wasn't that great, but it was a large portion.  we started with a few apps'.  they were calamari (nothing special, overpriced at $13), also the brie (chambord brie stuffed with apricots, apples and pecans finished with an apple glaze).  this was pretty delish, but at $14 again a bit high and the final app' was oysters bienville (oysters topped with asiago, crab and spinach).  this was okay, but again the same theme here overpriced for quality.  a few folks had the ceaser salad which was fun because it was prepared tableside.  i was told it was very good.  megan got some chicken dish with pineapple.  it looked pretty good and not dry.  tom and keith had some type of preperation of veal, which they both said was excellent served with perfectly cooked root vegetables and mashed potatoes.  matt had the steak diane, which is fun again because it's two small filets prepared tableside with a nice demi-glaze.  i had the lamb which were several small lamb chops lightly breaded with a mustard type glaze and breading.  it was okay and i will admit i ate all of it, however it was a bit more "gamey" than it should have been.  there were several desserts sampled and most were palatable.  megan tried some coffee at the end, however the cream was spoiled.  the waiter quickly replaced.  this is a place you should take out of town guests, however if it's my "dime", which it usually isn't when i'm here you can do better elsewhere.  you are easily paying a 20% premium for the view and it is pretty much the opposite of "hip or trendy", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  the service is 4 stars, the food 2 stars or less because of price, but the view is 5 stars.  go at least once and sadly that's probably enough.

Vbeing a minimalist person and not requiring cable, tivo, 3d tvs and the like, i haven't had the internet at home for years. j and i both have laptops and when you can go to a coffee shop or hop on the net at work or from your smart phone, who really needs it? well, i'm going back to school, so i do.\u000a\u000ai went into the store and a sales rep eagerly came to ask if i needed assistance, i declared, "yes! i need home internet service" what would i be using this for and how many devices would i be connecting she asked. "2 laptops and an xbox. we watch a lot of streaming netflix movies and play online video games (j was so pumped he'd be able to play online again, after 3 years)." this would be perfect for you then she exclaimed, showing me the mifi. you can connect up to 5 devices and its a sinch to hook up... only $100 with a $50 rebate and your employee discount waives activation fee and $50 a month for service. sweeeet, i thought, so i purchased it.\u000a\u000anever was a data plan discussed with me and never was a data plan explained to me. so imagine my shock when i went online to check some stuff (my little sis is on my account and sometimes downloads a lot so i monitor it) my bill was already $958!!! 5 days into the cycle. yes! 5 days in. tears welled up in my eyes and i called j and k to stop using their phones until i got this shit taken care of. come to find out i was on a 5gb plan and every gig i went over i was being charged $10. we were at 67gb. verizon's largest package was 10gb. \u000a\u000amaybe i should have asked more questions but i told the woman what we used the net for. surfing, streaming, gaming. why this was never explained to me is beyond my comprehension. i also told her i was not tech saavy so i feel like she took complete advantage of my naivety. the sales reps at the store made me feel completely stupid and so did the customer service over the phone. i guess they are all about profit and not customer satisfaction or education. i can not wait until my contract with these assholes expires.

Vi do wish the prices were lower at rei, but i must say that their products are high quality and they stand behind them with an excellent return policy.  i have made some excellent sale purchases, and also some impulse buys, but i am always impressed by the durability and design of their products.  some things that i use all the time are a light weight backpack and some marvelous hiking boots.  the sales personnel are never pushy and always helpful.  i enjoy their climbing wall from time to time, but also it's fun to watch kids take the challenge of climbing to the top.  if you are an rei member, you get a better price, so i advise you to join, plus there is a nice rewards program.  i do have one story of a wonderful experience i had with my bicycle at rei.  the quick release lever had fallen off my front wheel during a ride, but because i was an rei customer, they gave me the part free.  it didn't matter that i had not purchased the bike in the store.

Vsituated right on murray ave. in the heart of greenfield is a little dive bar named the coop. it has 1 pool table, 1 dart board, 2 touch & plays, 2 tv's (the big screen is hd and almost always has sports on), there is a limited juke box but it has something for everybody. it can get pretty loud during a steelers or pens game. the owners & evening bartender are friendly and inviting.\u000a\u000athe food is classic pub grub lovingly prepared. wednesday is wing night and it can get pretty crazy (if you want your wings at 8p when it starts you better have your order in by 6p). all of the portions are incredibly large so come hungry. it has a better selection of beer than your average dive bar - all the big 3 beers are there plus guinness and heiniken.\u000a\u000ait reminds me of cheers - you go there a couple times and everyone knows your name and welcomes you when you walk in the door

Vif there were ever a bar in pittsburgh that would somewhat remind you of cheers, the coop would be it (sorry october, but i agree, i was thinking that before i read your review).  it's one of those places that you want to go into even though it is a "dive bar."  i'm by no means a regular there, but i feel as if the bartender knows me well enough to be able to grab my preference in beer without me saying a thing.\u000a\u000ayes, it can get rowdy and loud, but that's part of the charm there.  many a nights have been spent there saying, "huh, what?" to a friend because you can't understand them.  the bartenders are inviting and love the chat when they got a sec.  the patrons that do regular the place are always nice and up for a chat with you.  \u000a\u000athe tvs usually have sports on, expected of a bar in the burgh.  the jukebox has an awesome selection of songs that span the decades.  i've caught myself singing along to some 70s stuff and then the next beat i'm having a good time with more recent music.  pool table is a bit cramped, but that doesn't stop people from playing.  the touch and plays definitely fill up the night if you're not paying attention.\u000a\u000athe food is amazing.  i've had their fries and the portion is ginormous.  they're big and potatoey.  might be the irish coming out in me, but i fell in love with those fries, the right amount of grease for sure.  \u000a\u000athey are in no rush to kick you out at the end of the night, they let you finish your beer instead of gulping it down.  even though they are just following you to the door to unlock it for you to get out, you feel like you are getting a personal escort.  it might just be the fact that as they are letting out the door they are saying to you, 'thanks for coming and have a good night.'\u000a\u000aside note: cash only.

Vthis week has really shaped up to be the "susan world tour, 2010" as far as concerts have been concerned.  okay, "world tour" might be stretching it a bit.  let's just say it's a "pittsburgh metro area tour 2010".  i went to the byham theater last night to see richard thompson in concert last night.  the funny thing is, i have none of his cds in my collection, and only a "best of" that he did with his ex-wife, linda thompson.\u000a\u000amy only exposure to his solo work spanning 30 years has been what i've heard on wyep and i believe he's done a couple of tv shows for pbs.  oh and don't forget a you tube i saw of him doing the britney spears tune "oops i did it again".  trust me folks, it works as both send up and on its own.  i read a great quote on you tube, which went something like "if there were any justice in the world, richard thompson would be on the radio and the only microphone britney spears would need would be the one at the burger king drive up window."  so true.\u000a\u000athompson played a lot of material from his new cd, "dream attic", followed by a lot of favorites.  thompson, 61, had a great quote in the tribune-review, "you don't expect a filmmaker or novelist to taper off after they're 40 years old; you expect their best work after 40. i really don't see why that shouldn't apply to popular music."\u000a\u000athe byham itself is a little on the unspectacular side, but still a good place to see a show.  it's size works perfectly for acts like thompson.  the byham was originally a movie theatre and it was once called the fulton.  it operated as such until the 1990s or so, probably the last cinema showing regular films downtown.  i recall the fulton mini which showed a lot of art and indie flicks.  my seat (and yes i went alone) was on the main floor and i thought the sightlines and acoustics were very good.  it works well for acts that play in theaters instead of arenas.

Vthe byham is smaller than other theaters in the cultural district, but the acoustics are very good.  i saw puscifer here and even in the balcony, the sound was clear and nothing was phased out.  \u000a\u000ait's cool that they have a variety of shows--ballets, plays, movies, and rock concerts--all under one roof.

Vi had a seriously shocking amount of fun here last night.  more fun than i've had in a bar in a looooong time.   but i might be biased, because....\u000a\u000awe won trivia night!  woohoo!!\u000a\u000ait was my first trivia night here at the jaggerbush.  we got there around 730ish and it was easy to get a table, but just before and after 8pm, they filled up quickly.  trivia got started around 830.  the dude who runs trivia night was really funny and very muscular, and let me and my friend touch his biceps.  so that's a plus.  he had a great sense of humor, the whole place was really high energy.  he also played seriously random and awesome music in between quiz questions.  like the best and weirdest ipod in the world on shuffle.\u000a\u000atrivia is really fun, and took about 90 minutes for the whole game.  it's well-organized, with a wide variety of questions so you don't need to be an expert in one genre or another to do well.  you get to assign point values to your answers, so if you're really sure about one category you can assign the most points, and if you are making a random wild guess you can assign fewer points.\u000a\u000aanyway it was challenging and exciting and we won so that rules.  i had to leave right after the game was over so i do not know what our reward was, but i'm told we get a gift card to the bar or something like that, so it's incentive to come back for more trivia!\u000a\u000abottled beer was $3.50, bartenders were friendly.  atmosphere is divey casual but very lively on tuesday trivia night.  tvs to watch various pittsburgh teams play sports.  and they still allow smoking, unfortunately, so i smelled like nasty gross ashtray at the end of the night, which i hate.  ugh city smoking ban please?\u000a\u000abut yeah, i'd totally come back for trivia, any week.  not sure i'd come just to hang out, given the cigarette factor, but the trivia night is solid.

Vthis is a small family-owned business, and although i've only been here once, the service was friendly and the staff seemed knowledgeable. the father sharpened and waxed my skis for me, and the son helped my girlfriend purchased new ski boots. compared with the other ski shops i've seen around town, this one seemed more honest and i will definitely return in the future. prices were on par with other shops, and the service on my skis was completed while we shopped.

Vthis is just an oddly configured getgo.  it's hard to come in here and get right to a pump.  there is so much traffic on 51 that everyone has the same idea.  that idea being i'll just pull in real quick and get my gas.  let me tell you people, that doesn't happen here.\u000a\u000aexiting is just as not fun here.  i chose to go to the light instead of pulling out onto 51 again.  it's just so much easier than praying that you'll make out of there alive.

Vhey!  where are all the reviews for this place?  anybody?  bueller?\u000a\u000ayes, i've only been here once, and yes, i've only had one kind of fudge (pecan turtle), but it was amazing and people should know about it.  in fact,  pecan turtle was nearly sold out, so we can't be the only people who know about the deliciousness.\u000a\u000anot only was the fudge luscious, but the woman behind the counter was sweet and friendly, and told us how to store the fudge best for optimum lasting power.  and indeed, a few days later, it is still as delicious as the day we bought it.\u000a\u000aso, everyone come check it out, and join me in giving the great reviews!

Vi was originally excited when my sisiter was selling fudgie wudgie as a fundraiser, i've heard about the company and wanted to try it for some time now. i finally decided on a box on truffles because it had a variety of fudgie flavors. i bit into a pistachio flavored truffle and began to look at the half that was not in my mouth (i study my food sometimes... don't judge me), there was an air pocket between the fudge and the chocolate coating with mold growing between, yes...mold. at first i was in denial (still chewing the half that made it into my mouth) i kept looking at it hoping that it was something else, i began to peel back the chocolate layering and...yep, it was furry green mold. nuff said.

Vkiev is the best eastern european/russian grocery store in pittsburgh so far. it's clean, well-lit, the food is fresh and the people who work here are friendly. they have pelmeni, caviar, tvorog, a nice variety of kolbasa and salo, seaweed salad, freshly pickled cabbage and tomatoes. this is only place i was able to find that that sells pre-made olivie (and it is delicious, a huge container of it is sitting currently in my fridge). \u000a\u000athere's also a wall with konfeti (candy) that you can buy by weight and make your own assortment. bunch of pickled veggies, canned sardines and etc. the only thing that was lacking here was bread but i don't feel like it's a drawback since you can get most of your russian-tasting bread at numerous jewish bakeries up the street. they even have some greetings cards and russian magazines and newspapers. and you can order birthday cakes here from a russian bakery in nyc!

Vgreat sandwiches! they are located on liberty avenue across the street from fifth avenue place.\u000a\u000athey offer three types of different sandwiches. plain slims which is a regular sub minus the veggies. eight inch sub sandwiches and giant club sandwiches which have twice the meat and cheese. you can choose between two types of bread (french and seven grain). \u000a\u000ayou can also get a low carb lettuce wrap called a jj unwich if your watching your calories.\u000a\u000aif your really hungry or just want to have your own "man vs food" moment go for the jj gargantuan. it consists of genoa salami, sliced smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese on a french bun smothered with onions, mayo, lettuce and tomato covered with homemade italian dressing. it is utterly amazing! i think i have a tear in my eye.

Vtwo and a half stars!\u000a\u000aa couple of my co-workers and i had to attend an off-site training session this morning.  as a way of saying thanks, our district director treated the three of us to lunch afterwards.  to tell you the truth, because of all the great sandwich shops downtown, i'd never eaten at jimmy john's before.  subway, quizno's, jimmy john's--they're all pretty much alike to me.\u000a\u000ai did opt for the turkey tom and on its own merits, it was a good sandwich.   the turkey was better than what you get at subway and the veggies (sprouts, lettuce, tomatos, plus i had them put onions on mine) seemed fresh enough.  just a couple of notes of caution:  these are 8-inch subs and although you might think a turkey sandwich is light, these bad boys still pack in over 500 calories.  and that ain't even with cheese on it.  and if you opt for the "healthier" 7-grain wheat bread, you're bumping it up to over 600 calories.

Vfinally, a decent frozen yogurt spot in the burgh! this place beats the other two offerings in shadyside and oakland hands down! six flavors, self serve, fresh delicious fruit (and other) toppings, and it's reasonably priced! i really enjoyed the taro and original flavors (both tart) with kiwi, mango, and strawberries on top.

Vrazzy fresh has pretty good froyo by pgh standards (but then again, sweet berry and karmic yogurt are pretty darn mediocre at best).  they do self-serve yogurt working a 12 flavor rotation with 6 flavors daily.  if you're familiar with the froyo chain yogurtland on the west coast, it's pretty similar.\u000a\u000awhen you go to razzy fresh it's definitely all about their toppings though.  their yogurt isn't spectacular, but it's good enough.  toppings include the usual suspects when it comes to fruit (strawberry, mango, kiwi) but they also have blackberries!  they also have assorted cereals, various cookie crumbs, and chewy mochi.  i also like honey on my froyo, so next time i might ask the owner/suggest having a squeeze bottle of honey at the toppings bar as well.\u000a\u000athey have a $5 minimum for credit cards, but because they do end up being on the pricier side for froyo @ $.41 per ounce, hitting that minimum is a piece of cake.\u000a\u000ain a froyo saturated market razzy fresh might not stand out, but in pgh it's easily the place to be if you're in the mood for froyo.

Vsix yogurt flavors, tons of toppings: mango, blueberries, kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, pineapple (they manage to keep the fruit bins full even when they're extremely busy) and etc. i usually go for original flavor with tons of fruit mixed in. today i tried raspberry and it has replaced the original as #1, now i want to try raspberry+honeydew, it's probably the best combo there is. chocolate wasn't too great. they seem to be open late, at least until 11pm and have a $5 minimum on cards.

Vi love the selection of yogurt flavors, mix & match, get 1, or try them all. the topping options are expansive - get whatever you want and as much as you want.\u000a\u000athe self-serve is ingenious - if you don't enjoy it, you have no one to blame but yourself.

Voh.  delicious.\u000a\u000athis was one of my only frozen yogurt experiences, and my first in pittsburgh!  places with names like "swirlberry" and "frozyo" seem to be everywhere in large cities, but i've hardly ever gone since there wasn't one in my neighba-hood.  until now.\u000a\u000aone hot summer eve, i wanted to go out and get some air, and some yogurt.  fortunately, razzy fresh is about a 3-minute walk from my apartment (i know, who's the luckiest?)  so here at razzy fresh, you serve yourself.  they have....i wanna say 6 flavors of frozen yogurt to choose from, and they tell you which ones are nonfat, and which are especially tart.  apparently the flavors change often - i remember "original," "raspberry," and "taro" when i was there.  taro was too tart for me, but original was perfect.\u000a\u000athen you step over to the mix-ins area, and help yourself to toppings!  they have a lot rich, sweet, bad-for-you toppings like peanut butter cups, oreo bits, chocolate chips, sprinkles (which i got!  lerv) and then a bunch of fresh fruit (kiwi, raspberries, blueberries, mango, strawberries, maybe even something else) which is what i mostly put on my yogurt.  fruit and sprinkles.  nom.\u000a\u000aat 41 cents per oz, my very sizeable portion was about $3.80.  i thought it was a steal!  i can't wait to go back on the next hot day, because my yogurt was delicious and absolutely will hit the spot every time.

Voh, how i love razzy fresh!  i love any fro-yo place, really, but a couple things set rf apart:\u000a\u000a-the tart flavors are labeled, so you won't end up with an unsweetened yogurt you aren't expecting.  also, if you have any doubts, ask for a free sample cup or two at the register.\u000a-great selection of toppings: the fruit is always fresh and they have two flavors of mochi.\u000a-nice and bright on the inside--it can cheer me up on the gloomiest pittsburgh day.\u000a\u000adon't come here in the evening expecting to sit and chat a while--they have maybe three tiny tables inside that are always overcrowded.  minus a star for that, otherwise, perfect.

Vwe're getting on that time of year folks. you know, when the days are still warm but the nights are getting cooler. where'd the summer go? well there's still time to take a walk with your loved one and get a nice cool treat. \u000a\u000arazzy fresh is yet another one of those places that are right in the neighborhood that i'd just never gotten around to reviewing. razzy fresh has got some amazing frozen yogurts and toppings. and not just plain vanilla either--they've got honeydew, passion fruit, mango, lychee, etc. as for fresh fruit toppings, they've got mango, kiwi, pineapple, etc. and for dry toppings they've got fruity pebbles, reeses, m&ms. rice krispies, and white chocolate to name a few. \u000a\u000aso i went a little bold this time. i tried the lychee yogurt topped with raspberries and white chocolate. yum!

Vrazzy my razzy!  time for another end-of-summer review.  yes i know i've been here a few times this summer, but it's been a hectic one and i've taken a little break from yelping!\u000a\u000aanyway, much like my review last year, the days and nights are cooling off a little bit and there's still a little time left to take a walk for some yummy treats with your significant other.  so how 'bout some original flavor topped with pineapple and white chocolate?  yum!

Vhungry for some of kevin sousa's food, but the menu at salt doesn't change frequently enough for your taste? while you wait for union pig & chicken to open, station street hot dogs offers you a late new years gift - a closed hot dog shop, revived by sousa and his brother to create fun but still sophisticated food.\u000a\u000aupon walking in to the shop, you're greeted with two familiar features - first, a wide open kitchen, striking due to the fact that a hot dog joint is usually the type of establishment where you'd rather not see environment your food is being cooked in. this, though, is spotless and currently manned by some familiar faces from salt's kitchen(easily identified by their tattoos and salt t-shirts under their aprons).\u000a\u000asecond, a large chalkboard menu above the register. hot dogs range from a standard dog($4) to a sweetbread-laden frank topped with an apple mostarda($9), with most of the dogs featuring american(chili,saurkraut) or asian(kim chi, sweet soy sauce) influences. other items on the menu include fries, optionally fried in duck fat($3/$5) and mexican coke($2). around the outside of the restaurant is a bar with stools for seating, and a few trays of condiments(ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, vinegar, sriracha).\u000a\u000awe ordered a hawaii dog($5), a devil dog($5), and a kim chi dog($7), along with fries. the hawaiian dog tasted fantastic, sweet and salty all at the same time, though i wasn't pleased to find a small garnish of fresh mint, an herb that i'm not fond of. surprisingly, the mint wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but i would have enjoyed it more without. also, they are unfortunately not immune to the age-old mistake of putting watery toppings on a hot dog - the bottom of the bun turned to mush and the two halves had split by the time i could pick it up. the devil dog was a bit bland, egg salad, tabasco, and potato chips tastes about how it sounds, and was not very spicy at all. as a chilihead, i'd prefer to see a non-tabasco hot sauce used here, and this turned into the spicy dog expected it to be.\u000a\u000athe kim chi dog was the star of the show, though. if you've ever gone to the brooklyn flea and stopped at asia dog, you know how wonderful of a combination kim chi and hot dogs can make. i've searched high and low for a competitor to those wonderful dogs, and now there is one mere blocks away from me. covered in kim chi and kewpie mayo(a japanese brand of mayo made with vinegar and egg yolks), garnished with bonito and strips of nori, the flavors of this were spicy and creamy and bold and salty - my favorite combination. i did find the price tag to be a bit hefty, but i've spent more on bad downtown lunches, so it could be worse.\u000a\u000athe fries were tasty, well-fried and salty, but not particularly notable. my only other complaint of this place would have to be the atmosphere - it was almost dead silent, even the guys calling out the order numbers was quiet. a hot-dog joint where you sit on barstools, to me, should be boisterous - cooks yelling, pans banging on the griddle, etc. hell, at least put in a jukebox or something.\u000a\u000aother than that, this is an awesome reinvention of an east liberty landmark. i urge you to come give it a shot and see what an inventive hot dog can taste like, especially with the awesome hours(open until 11pm mon-sat!!). also, i urge you to take a look at the fantastic website of this establishment, i was really impressed by the design.\u000a\u000a--also, they offer smart dogs as a veggie replacement for any menu item. i'm not a fan of them, though, as their texture is too far off(feels like lumpy pudding) - i wish they'd take advice from franktuary and get a local option, and a veggie option that doesn't try to imitate.

Vi'm a fan.  i'll go back regularly, as it's right next to work.\u000a\u000a\u000athe hawaiian dog was the winner.  all around great.  my girlfriend's a fan of the devil dog.  the plain dog is solid.\u000a\u000athe chili dog was really, really dull; it's some of the most boring chili i've had in awhile, and it reminds me of the staag chili-in-a-can my neighbor's dad ate when i was a kid.  some tomato, or some spice, or some heat would help this for me.\u000a\u000athe new york dog is missing something, but i can't figure it out yet.\u000a\u000athe buns fall apart with the wetter toppings, which made this a bit of a mess.\u000a\u000a\u000athe regular fries at $3 are almost indistinguishable, to me, from the $5 duck fat fries.  both are good, but neither tasted clearly better.

Vi got the bahn mi dog, which is a wonderfully souful combination of vietnamese flavors.  delicious.  the fries are fresh cut, not frozen, and arguably the best in town. they taste real, this is how i remember fries before everyone started using frozen potatoes.  the fries portion is large enough for 2 to share.

Vso, my husband and i have long lamented the lack of low priced good food around where we live. that is, we've been looking high and low for a cheap meal (think less than $10 pp) that isn't pizza or a chain, like chipotle or panera. for a while, the only place we had on our list was la feria (which, to be fair, breaks the $10 rule by two dollars or so sometimes). enter station street hot dogs.\u000a\u000afirst - gotta come clean, we only tried the veggie dogs. lord only knows, the beef dogs must be fabulous, because the veggie dogs are legit. as in, i could barely tell they were veggie dogs. they had all the texture and taste of a regular hotdog, minus the dripping grease. so, if you've ever been interested in trying high quality vegetarian protein, try this. i got the po boy (delicious) and the hubster had both a classic and a veggie chili dog. the veggie chili was meh, but apparently, the meat chili is made from the brisket that they use at union pig and chicken, and if you have seen my review of that, you'll know why my mouth is suddenly salivating. next time i come, i'm getting the poutine - the gravy for that is also made from the brisket drippings.\u000a\u000aso get your legs a moving over here and give this place a try. it doesn't have to be a gut buster, and it almost certainly isn't a wallet buster. rumor has it that they are going to try a legit dinner menu sometime down the road.

Vit's unofficially summer.  when you can go get a fresh grilled hot dog and sit outside to eat while getting a sunburn, it's definitely unofficially summer.  and what better place to do it at than station street?\u000a\u000ait's got that old feel mixed with new flavor.  it definitely can tickle anyone's fancy.  the menu...it's simple: choose your dog, choose your fry, choose your drink and slide on down the line.  service is super fast with courteous staff that are polite beyond belief.  from time of order until the time my order was ready, i barely had enough time to slide my straw into my drink, and that was during lunchtime, with cars pulling in one after another.\u000a\u000athe food, oh the food, how i could have probably downed several of their variations on hot dogs.  but with summer here, i need to realize baggy clothes are out.  i stayed with just my one dog and some hand cut fries and was full when i left here.  of course i opted for a chili cheese dog, who wouldn't?  but this isn't your run of the mill chili cheese dog.  the chili is made from brisket, and the cheese, it's not from a can, it's big huge cheese curd chunks.  i think they should invent some jumbo hot dog buns here, the dog sticks out on both ends of the bun which let's you know you are going to be full here.  and the fries, crunchy and salty.  fried to the point that they almost remind you of potato chips.  i keep kicking myself, i should have got the poutine, but that just warrants me another visit to the fine establishment.  \u000a\u000ai love the outdoor seating area.  music is pumped outside so you don't hear the cars, buses or trains as loudly as you would.  the view needs a little work, but i'm not going to fault them for that.  it's not very often you get that close to the church from dogma (you can see the shingles falling off the roof).\u000a\u000alike the staff said as we were leaving, "thanks, hope to see you guys again soon!" oh, you will, most definitely.

Vi decided to come here for lunch instead of going to my beloved chipotle. i had the banh mi dog, which was very delicious. however. . .\u000a\u000athe actual hot dog looked nothing like the photos i've seen from other reviewers. photo after photo shows plump dogs hanging off their buns. my hot dog was scrawny, short and looked like a generic value time hot dog from giant eagle. what's up with that and having to pay $7 for it?\u000a\u000adespite the hot dog setback, i would definitely return to station street to try out their poutine. i didn't get any at my first visit but other customers had them and they looked and smelled awesome!

Vthis place was pretty good, but not incredible. i would recommend the al pastor tacos as they were quite flavorful and came with pineapple! the chicken tacos were bland and unremarkable. unfortunately, the tacos were only served with a single corn tortilla which fell apart quickly.\u000a\u000athis is better mexican food than many places around pittsburgh, but only in the middle of my range. i wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but would probably try it again if i was driving by.

Vfortunately i have a low-maintenance dog, grooming-wise: she's short haired, doesn't shed much, and rarely gets into anything smelly.  unfortunately, i think she's claustrophobic.  she spends bath times trying to escape and pedicure sessions running away, so finding a groomer is essential.  throw in the fact that she's a pitbull and people are afraid of the breed, and it gets even harder.\u000a\u000athe petco groomers were pretty good.  they were able to squeeze her in with about 24 hours' notice.  at first i thought the groomer seemed a little stand-offish but when rosa popped her head over the counter, she immediately warmed up.  there was a different groomer to ring us up and she said that rosa was friendly and full of kisses, so obviously the groomers were nice and she felt comfortable, which makes me feel comfortable if/when i bring her back.\u000a\u000ait cost $32 for a full service bath, which "includes a 15-minute brush out, bath, blow dry, ears cleaned, nails trimmed, anal glands checked, ribbon and fragrance".  they have a lot of other add-on services, like a de-skunking bath and teeth brushing.  it you have a petco pals card, you get the 9th grooming session free.\u000a\u000athe only cons were that it took a while (about an hour and a half - a weekday appointment might be faster) and the entrance to the grooming section is right next to the cages of adoptable cats - this seems like a sure way to ensure traumatized cats.  there is a separate door that we used to exit, so definitely use that if your dog will try to go after the cats.\u000a\u000aas far as the store itself, it's huge.  petco is like the walmart of pet stores - everything you could ever need is here.  they also sell fish, reptiles, and little mammals (ferrets, mice, guinea pigs).\u000a\u000ai would prefer to go to a locally owned groomer and pet store, but i was surprised and pleased with petco's grooming.

Vit's convenient, it's close, it's petco.  i frequent a lot just because i can take little man in if i want.  careful taking your pet inside, or you might have the experience i had where a gentleman was walking and didn't notice my pup and kicked him.  \u000a\u000aprices are moderate, depending on what you are looking for.  be sure to have or get the card there, even if you don't plan on shopping often.  without it  you won't get the deals, and like i said, prices are moderate.  \u000a\u000aselection is good, wide variety.  my pup and cat don't seem to mind when i go a little wild in there and come home with just about everything i didn't need.

Vi was totally impressed with this fast-food chain location.  the food was hot and fresh, the employees were friendly.  the place was well-lit, has a huge play area for kids, and was spotless.\u000a\u000ait was seriously like a model example of how a fast-food place is supposed to be...it's a good thing they're not all like this or i would eat a lot more of it!

Vthis particular chik-fil-a is one of the best fast food establishments i've ever been too. the food is good, although i admit i always buy the chicken nuggets whenever i come. they're not greasy, soggy or salty. the coleslaw isn't that bad either. refills are free.\u000a\u000a the customer service is what i really like about this place. the staff is friendly and smiles. a staff person will walk around and and ask dining customers if the food was okay or offer to get another refill or take away your tray. i have not witnessed any frowns are surly attitudes yet. this place gets extremely busy and crowded around lunch time yet the service remains consistent. \u000a\u000ai've never used the restroom but the dining area is clean and the condiment counter is organized. on some occasions there will be fresh flowers on the tables. \u000a\u000achik-fil-a gets 5-stars for their food and pleasant, professional service!

Vas i turn that curve and see the hideous orange "big!lots" sign come into view, my dopamine neurons start a'firing.  \u000a\u000aoh how i love you, big lots! \u000a\u000ai'm a girl who loves a deal, but who also likes to have nice things, and big lots frequently satisfies that need.  my 2 favorite sections are the housewares and dry foods, though they also have automotive, furniture, personal care and kids toys. \u000a\u000acrockpots, cuisinart programmable coffee makers, and paula deen cast iron skillets and roasters for $20 and less.  blenders, dishes, glasses, utensils, not to mention the inexpensive throw pillows, curtains and seasonal decorations (i mean, who really wants to pay $6 for a christmas cookie tin at target when you can get the same thing here for $2) are bountiful. then i love going to the dry food section and stocking up on kashi & pepridge farms products, fancy european jams, & dry spices, then finishing my shopping at giant eagle and noting the price difference. then, the best part, *the best part* is their rewards club.  every so often, you'll get e-mailed a 20% off coupon that applies to everything in store, so that $20 cuisinart blender is now only $16!

Vi'm thinking my joy for big lots is starting to fade.\u000a\u000awhat was once a happy trip to pick up some unwanted items is now more of chore.  i feel like you need to put on some gear to go into the wild to find items that you may want or need.  can definitely tell it is a buyout store, but not as bad as ollie's.  the aisles are more organized even though the store is set up weirdly.  \u000a\u000ai always find myself going into to the store to search for an item and only realize i have forgotten to pick it up when i'm on my way back home.

Vi've reviewed other big lot's but this is my favorite. it's close and it has all the staples i need like tp (12 rolls for $5) and bold evoo ($5). bl is also a great place to shop for holiday and seasonal decorations especially after the holiday, when items go half off then eventually 75-90% off. i made sure to stock up for this years halloween and christmas.\u000awhen i stop in it's usually for a couple items, but i always end up with a buggy full of this and that. the cashiers are absolutely delightful, they all know me by name and are so polite and helpful which is becoming harder and harder to come by these days.

Vwhat, no reviews for the melwood screening room?  what's wrong--don't you people like movies?  more accurately, don't you people like good cinema in an off-beat setting?\u000a\u000athe melwood screening room is owned by pittsburgh filmmakers.  it along with the harris and regent square show foriegn, indie, and revival pix that you just can't get anywhere.  my husband rick and i each have our screenie passes, which can be used for 12 admissions and 12 popcorns or soft drinks.  all for $80.00 each and they can be shared with friends.  not a bad deal.\u000a\u000aso with our screenies we came over to the melwood to see "taxi driver".  yep, the "taxi driver"!  i'd never seen it before, but i now understand why it was considered one of the greatest movies of the 1970s.  "village voice" said: "libidinal politics, celebrity worship, sexual exploitation, the fetishization of guns and violence, racial stereotyping, the fear of foreigners - not to mention the promise of apocalyptic religion - all remain. taxi driver lives. see it again. and try to have a nice day." \u000a\u000aas for the melwood screening room itself, it really is that--just a room with 130 seats.  so we are talking an intimate venue here.  melwood was built in 1995 into part of a converted urban warehouse.  it houses pittsburgh filmmakers' administrative offices, its classrooms, and art galleries. but if you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary, come check it out.

Vthe melwood screening room shows wonderful foreign, art, and documentary films.  it seats 130, so it's someone small and intimate.  if you like the big screen, then filmmakers has a larger movie house called the regent in regent square.\u000a\u000athe melwood has reasonably priced popcorn and drinks, but it's mostly about the high quality cinema that you won't find too many other places.\u000a\u000ai have gone to several screenings where i've met the filmmaker, and sometimes there is a nice reception, which is a great way to meet other film fans.  best of all, the melwood is one of the theaters used for both the 3 rivers film festival and the silk screen film festival, both are worth checking out.\u000a\u000aparking is mostly on the street, plus they do have their own parking lot.

Vfor years, i drove by this restaurant and laughed - korean, japanese, and i believe it also mentioned chinese food?  are you kidding me?  i definitely try to avoid asian restaurants that make more than 1 country's food.  however, my friend brought me here, and because i was being polite, decided to try it without laughing.  especially since she told me their korean food was good.  i needed to find a good korean restaurant in pittsburgh!  \u000a\u000athe food was surprisingly good!  it was a tuesday, and they had some sort of sushi special going on, something like $1 per nigiri sushi - what a good deal!  and the kalbi...  yum!  not the best that i have had (that is reserved for korea house in san jose), but decent.  the best that i have had in pittsburgh, actually.  and they had a decent selection of ban chan!  that alone made me happy.  \u000a\u000athe staff is very friendly.  i would definitely come back here again!  no more laughing as i drive by - in fact, now i usually wistfully gaze at the restaurant and think about kalbi.

Vpart of growing up is picking your own doctor.  most people don't get it right the first time and some even go longer before they find the perfect fit. for me however, i got it right the first time. \u000a\u000awhen i moved to the city years ago i wasn't sure where to go for a doctor and traveling back and forth to my childhood neighborhood wasn't an option when something came up medically.  i did little research when it came to finding a doctor and frankly i just showed up one day at the office and asked to be seen.  luckily for me dr. jarvis was a perfect fit. any time that i've had an appointment with him for a check up he puts me at ease. \u000a\u000aeven if its just a last minute stop when an illness pops up they seem to be able to fit you into the schedule, which is what happened recently for me. i was able to get an appointment, be seen and have a medication sent via computer to my pharmacy before i left out the office door.\u000a\u000aother pros to this location, even though it appears small from the outside they have a lab that can draw a specimen on site. also if it is something they can't handle, upmc shadyside is across the street.  parking is provided off street for patients at no additional cost. and they have a friendly staff.

Vi had a groupon so i invited my sister to have lunch with me. i actually thought the place was closed because, from the outside, it looked very empty and dreary. when we went inside there was only one person there working. it was very quiet. even though there was a large portable ac at the front of the store, the place was still hot. \u000a\u000amy sister ordered a gyro and i ordered a rueben. the only sides available were potato chips and french onion soup; we chose the soup. i took the last plastic spoon and i was told that the restaurant was out of spoons. luckily, i was able to find a spare spoon in my purse. \u000a\u000amy sister loved her gyro and i loved my reuben. i really loved the french onion soup that was topped with cheese and i ate that first. \u000a\u000aeast end cafe is in a very good location and the food isn't that bad. however, the owner can make the place livelier and more inviting.

Vi really like this place.  the massage prices are reasonable, and the staff i've encountered are kind, competent and professional.  pcchh offers a wide variety of massages and "energy work" like acupressure and reiki.  their rooms are pretty quiet, so you don't have to listen to outside noises or other clients while you're trying to relax.  they are located in regent square across from square cafe.

V4.5 stars.\u000a\u000ariverview park is considered the gem of pittsburgh's north side and it was created in 1894.  it predates the city of allegheny's annexation to the city of pittsburgh in 1907.  it's home to the allegheny observatory, a visitor's center, and the mairdale watershed.  it's also got many recreational amenities such as a swimming pool, playground, baseball diamonds, and of course hiking trails.\u000a\u000aand it was the hiking that brought me and my girlfriends here this past weekend.  we are avid hikers and we'd never been here before.  there's nothing quite like hiking on a bee-you-tee-full october day.  now granted, we prefer hiking on cool fall days when that crisp bite in the air gets our blood going.  but hey, when the weather's this great, who cares?  \u000a\u000awe met up at the visitor's center, which is accessible from perrysville avenue and watson boulevard via riverview avenue.  we began with an easy hike going counterclockwise on the observatory trail.  this is an approximately 1/2 mile loop and it gives you a great overview of the observatory and the park.  we then crossed the main road and entered the east end of the park, via the old kilbuck trail.  we then made a clockwise loop via the leaning ash trail, the marshall trail, the ground hog haven trail, and the old zoo trail.  then we made our way down the overlook trail to the chapel shelter.  \u000a\u000aby this point we hiked about 2.75 miles and decided to take a snack break.  i have type-1 diabetes so i needed to "sugar up".  the chapel shelter is a remnant of a former presbytarian church, restored by the pittsburgh parks conservacy in 2008.  the restoration included creating a new trail, planting of native species and the clearing out of invasive species.  \u000a\u000afrom this point we decided to take it up a notch a little bit.  resuming our clockwise direction, we returned to the overlook trail and then took that to the snyder's point loop trail.  we looped on that before taking the deer hollow trail back to the overlook trail and then returning to the visitor's center.  \u000a\u000aafter taking another break here, we decided to kick it in even more.  we decided to go for the rigorous hike as recommended by the park's website.  we hit the wissahickon trail and then went up towards the park's northern edge via the archery trail, the snowflake trail, and back east via the archery trail again.  but then the hike grew more difficult!   we resumed the wissahickon trail, arced around the picnic grove, before taking the steps up to the road and followed it to the bob harvey trail.  we followed that trail to the bear pit, then paused to catch our breath (pant, pant) before returning to the visitor's center.  man, that last part of our hike really had some steep ups and downs!  \u000a\u000aso as rachel said, this is a stunning park and it's well worth your visit.  but the trails are not well marked and you would be wise to bring a map.  the park's website http://www.pittsburghparks.org/userdocs/riverview-letter.pdf has a good one.  although i recommend  using a good topography map along with the park's map.  a topo map will show you what you're getting into on the trails.  we hiked almost 7 miles without leaving the park's borders.  man, i must have sweated off 10 lbs. on that hike!

Va beautiful 287 acre park that features marvelous walking trails, horseback riding and pavilion rentals. in the center of the park is the allegheny observatory, and you can sign up for free tours, however you must call for a reservation. there is a 2 mile trail that loops around the park, however the trail is not well marked, so a trail map is recommended. there are some steep slopes in the park, which some will find charming, some will find challenging. deer are plentiful, as are song birds.

Vthis was a nice little stop downtown while we were doing out rounds at the arts festival.  was not busy at all, and we were able to get in and out quickly.  \u000a\u000athe staff were polite and had our drinks made in no time flat.  it was that quick that i wasn't able to notice anything else about this place except that it had outdoor seating, that's how quickly they work here.

Vi had a pretty negative experience here.  i was told that my design was "about the worst design possible," which was condescendingly explained as being because i wanted it to have a circle in it, but "the human body isn't flat."  really!!! the human body isn't flat!  no way!  i'm pretty sure i've seen a lot of people with circles in their tattoos before.  i have a tattoo on me already that was at least as complicated as the design i brought in to cyclops that they essentially refused to do.  i appreciate that the artist i talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos i was surprised that he was so rude.  i definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  i also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.  \u000a\u000ain the end i'm glad that i didn't get tattooed here, because i wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  i give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what i wanted but was refused).  i guess if you really don't care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty, it would still be an ok place to go.

Vnote.  this review is just for the bad coffee experience i had one morning.\u000a\u000ai had to stop here one morning for coffee as i was on my way to an off-site meeting.  normally i wouldn't bother with a review of convenience stores, but who the hell put decaf in the regular pot?  how could i tell it was decaf?  susan didn't assume the form of a human female after drinking it!  it tasted burnt and flat and i'm pretty sure i peeled a little film of the top!\u000a\u000aon the other hand, the meeting wasn't worth staying awake for anyway!

Va 7-eleven downtown always make me feel dirty.  doesn't matter what corner or what part of downtown they are located.\u000a\u000athey are all almost always cramped, jammed into a very awkward space and made to contain everything a normal store would carry.  the clientele inside, let's describe a majority of them as shady.  how many times in such a small space can i be asked if i have $.53 cents to get on a bus.  get out of 7/11, then you won't be spending that $.53 and be able to use it on the bus.\u000a\u000athis one is quite close to the center of the downtown region, but if memory serves me correctly, right now, there's not much else around it.  i think i could have been near having a panic attack before leaving here.  in a pinch, it's a quite stop and possibly cheaper than a drug store in the downtown region.

Vas far as walmarts go, this like the bottom of the barrel for walmarts.  i give be props to the fox chapel/aspinwall area for not caving into the demands of walmart and not allowing them to build a super walmart here, seeing that there is one in every direction within a 20 minute ride from here.  \u000a\u000awith that being said you can tell that this location had to scale back on every department in order to try and fit everything they could think of under one roof.  yes, it's smaller and you would think that would mean that you'd be able to find things more easily...wrong.  the set up is so awkward that you turn from the hardware section into the pet food aisle.  soaps right next to fresh produce (i'll wash my own fruit with the appropriate cleanser, i don't prefer head n shoulders on my bananas).  \u000a\u000achecking out here is such a chore.  my most recent visit i only had four items and it took me nearly fifteen minutes to clear the front of the store.  out of the many cash registers they could have had open, only three were in fact open to take customers.  each of the lines reached all the way back to where the merchandise started.  not good for wanting people to return for business.

Vi have had a love affair with pittsburgh for as long as i can remember.  i am a native pennsylvanian, but not a native pittsburgher.  i suppose that means i am a transplant pittsburgher.  even though i am the latter, this city has been welcoming and very hospitable that no matter where i roam to, i end up back here.\u000a\u000ai admit that when i first moved to the area i was that annoying driver that had no clue where he was going.  not my fault i must say.  when the downtown is set up like a triangle and some of the streets turn into sidewalks or stairs, it can be confusing to a newbie.  i also admit that i had no clue where the neighborhoods began or ended.  with over 90 neighborhoods that comprise the city, it is hard to figure out what getgo someone wants to meet at.\u000a\u000aas time passed, i grew into pittsburgh or maybe pittsburgh grew in me.  from the way i dressed to the way i now talk, i have become a pittsburgher.  you can call me a 'yinzer' if you like, but my response to you is going to require the word 'jagoff' in it.  a yinzer isn't anything bad to represent, it's like being a new yorker, philadelphian, or bostonian.  they all have their unique way of living just as this area does.\u000a\u000apittsburgh has grown and changed over the years, but for the better.  pittsburgh is kind of like that annoying person you know that loves the limelight, but easily melds back into the crowd without missing a beat.  that person that can be gracious yet confident enough to own up to the achievements it has accomplished.\u000a\u000ahere's to pittsburgh, my home, and my home away from home.  as willie stargell said, "i would always reserve a special place in my heart for pittsburgh."

Vnice store. right near trader joes and across the street from bakery square. similar to stein mart just a lot smaller and very few designer clothes if any. \u000a\u000alot of housewares like pillows, sheets, rugs, towels, dishes and more. there is also a small section of furniture in the back of the store. they also carry a small section of small electronics like mp3 player, headphones and other little gadgets. \u000a\u000adefiantly worth a look.

Vpsst!  wanna know about a great little deli?  want some tiny place hidden within an office tower?  want food that does not taste like cardboard (subway, jimmy johns)?  c'mon with me to yimmy's!  just be prepared to get your sandwich to go.  yimmy's has almost no seating.  \u000a\u000athis is a locally owned place.  it's the kind of place where you'll actually see the owner working there.  he'll make your sandwich for you.  he'll make recommendations for you.  he's open to suggestions and he makes changes to the menu himself.   i had me a ham-n-swiss sub that was amazing!

Vpido's reminds me of a place you would find in fayette county with its wood paneled walls and backwoodsy charm (i prefer places like this over clubs and crowded bars). the average patron is 30+ and casual, i think the only time it gets rowdy is friday night karaoke, which i avoid at all costs. the beer selection isn't the best but they do have new castle and that makes me happy.\u000a\u000aon to the food - freshly handmade pizza is phenomenal, wings can be served whole or wing dings, jb had a steak sandwich with onion blossoms last time we were there. i favor the blossoms over rings b/c its one bite! no more worrying about taking a bite and the onion sliding out leaving you with only a mouthful of breading and the sauce they come with is a perfect match. the sandwich was ridiculously large but he got it down no problem, so i guess it was good. the only thing that has left me dissatisfied was the cheese fries, they were a little limp and the cheese was melted shredded cheddar instead of cheese sauce but they were still edible.\u000a\u000aall in all, a good place to go grab a bite and a couple of cold ones.

Vi absolutely enjoy going to dr. rudavsky.  he's such a wonderful mix of old school, no nonsense optometrist, with lots of interesting high tech gadgets.  \u000a\u000ahe writes down his notes with a fountain pen.  his office reminds me of a pediatrician's office for kids.  all of this, i really love.  add to the mix his warm and genial manner, and his vast knowledge... he's the real deal.  i hope he never retires.

Vhorrible and ridiculous...there appears to be a pattern here ppa.  and nothing but one star reviews,  it's not a great pattern to have. \u000a\u000ataking away the meters was a huge thing. then putting in those new computerized stations throughout the city was an ok thing, but maybe you should have put some better lighting around those things. i mean i'm a bit leery walking to one of them in the dark and paying in the dark. i'm also a bit leery of how honest these machines want you to think they are. no slip to make sure you parked unless you print out a receipt.\u000a\u000aand how about the rates?  $3/hour, $.25/five minutes in the downtown area. that surely has deterred me from visiting some places that don't stay open later than when you continue to monitor the meters. and to park in a garage downtown is as equally gouging. it hurts. on the southside it's $1/hour. may i make a suggestion in some of these areas?  have a convenience spot or something like that, 15 minute free parking for people like me that just want to run in to a store/office, pick up my item, then run back out. paying $1 for one minute of parking was a bit ridiculous. \u000a\u000amaybe you can take a page from san francisco's book and fluctuate the rates for parking downtown depending on the time of day. they've got it figured out, even have an app to let you know when a spot opens up. that would be great here, especially how wonky the streets are downtown.

Vi haven't live in the city of pittsburgh in 14 years. i just hate how greedy the city of pittsburgh has become. they have managed to put those new dumb electronic meters everywhere including areas that never even had metered parking before. i mean do you really need to charge people to park on saturdays and sundays too? 25 cent for 5 minutes is crazy! i hate parking in the city and try to avoid it like the plague. \u000a\u000adon't even get me started on the parking garages downtown. most of them are utterly disgusting and smell like pee and are falling apart. and you have the gall to raise the prices even higher?!\u000a\u000ac'mon son!

Vi am not so sure where all this negativity is coming from for this place.  i'm in love with it.  it's gritty, it's cramped, it's greasy and it's everything i imagine a diner to be when placed in a downtown area.  in fact, i think that's what gives this place it's charm.\u000a\u000awhen you think diner, you picture one that they depict in movies or television shows.  one where the wait staff is quick with their wit, maybe a bit sarcastic too.  one where you want to smell the grease from the cooking in the back.  and even though cherries doesn't have the typical diner look on the inside, it has a very unique look to define itself.\u000a\u000awhen i walked in here, it was after the morning rush.  it was dieing down inside and it made for pretty quick service for me.  the waitress i got greeted me with a 'i'm late for my cigarette break' look, and a voice to match.  the order was sent to the back and i paid promptly after wards and just sat at the counter and waited.  while i waited, i thought the price i paid was a bit steep for the item i ordered.  i had ordered a breakfast sandwich and nothing more.  what i got was one huge honking sandwich.  it's was the equivalent of two or three breakfast sandwiches at any other place in the area.  when i pulled the sandwich out of the bag and it was wrapped in it's aluminum foil glory.  i truly did feel like i was on a movie set diner.  the toast was perfectly toasted.  the eggs were cooked to griddle perfection and the sausage patty was by far one of the best i have ever had.\u000a\u000ait should be noted, that like most small eateries and restaurants in the downtown area, they have a 3 o'clock closing time.  so you do need to be in the downtown area fairly early to enjoy this place.  credit cards are accepted.\u000a\u000aand this, my friends, makes my 400th review!

Vmarvelous venue for cabaret style shows and musical events.  somewhat small seating, but this allows for a nice connection to the performers.  they have salsa dancing here on friday nights, wine or beer tastings some tuesday nights, the space is programmed by the pittsburgh cultural trust.  the cabaret is directly behind the backstage bar, so dining and bar service is available.

Vi remember when this was crossroads and actually had gas pumps. i must admit, smart move getting rid if the gas pumps and just being a convenience store.  that lot it sits on is just too small for all that was going on there.\u000a\u000aas far as the convenience part, it's spot on.  able to walk in here and grab a snack or drink while you're walking the southside. feels a bit safer walking the parking lot too. not having to dodge all those cars is a plus.

Vyes, i know, it's a lingerie store, don't you all worry, i wasn't in here buying items for myself.  i came in here to find a friend that was shopping.  i also was able to observe the store.\u000a\u000afrom the viewpoint of a gay male, this store does nothing for me...if you know what i mean.  i was just noticing how the place was set up, and with no surprise here, it's just a smaller version of an american eagle store, except more organized.  i suppose people don't like messing with undergarments as much as other clothing.\u000a\u000ai also noticed how nice the staff was.  the associate noticed me looking around and knew i was in here to find someone.  she was kind enough to let me know that she was in the dressing room...uh...trying some things on.  also she was fantastic to talk to.  asides from knowing her job, she was a plethora of knowledge.\u000a\u000agood one on you for a store like this...i think.

Vi dread going to the post office! especially this location, there is always a line of 10-15 people and this line does not move fast. be prepared to wait and don't go if you have other things to do. if you have no other option, clear your schedule, wear some comfortable shoes and take your ipod so you don't have to hear all of the ridiculousness going on around you.

Vi mean, you're just going to go to the closest post office anyway, so why even write a review?? well, some of us have yelping problems, and we just can't stop reviewing every little thing! you can buy stamps at a kiosk 24/7, so that's nice. they have a pretty good variety of shipping containers (official usps kind, and fancy decorated kind), and i believe you can get passport photos here if you make an appointment.

Vthis is where i was first diagnosed.  at age nine.  the questions as to why i was going to the bathroom all the time.  why i was thirsty all the time.  why i was tired all the time.  it was at my pediatrician's at children's hospital that i received the news that would change my life.  at age nine, i was told i had type-1 diabetes.\u000a\u000amy nine-year-old mind blamed the doctors of course.  i was fine up until that point, right!  they must have put something in me to make me this way.  from that moment forward, everything had to be regimented.  my eating.  my testing my blood sugar.  i learned that i would have to have snacks when i was not hungry.  i learned that several times a day, i would have to prick myself with needles, take insulin, etc.\u000a\u000abut y'know what?  in looking back, the care i received was wonderful!  they taught me and my parents that it was not the end of the world.  they showed me how it was nobody's fault that this happened.  they taught me how to take my insulin.  i learned through stories and children's books how to do this.  much was being learned about diabetes back then (1986) and i discovered that i could still have a lot of the same foods i always liked.\u000a\u000alet me say that children's guided me and my parents through all of this.  no, diabetes is not the end of the world for a 9-year old girl.  but they taught me well that everything changes when you're a diabetic.  thanks to them, while i admit that i am not always a good girl when it comes to eating, i am meticulous about my healthcare.  i get my heart, teeth, kidneys, and feet checked on a regular basis.  i've become more consciencious about the obesity problem in this country.  and since i've long "graduated" to magee women's hospital, i still thank children's for what they've taught me.

Vtypical dollar tree location.  nothing to really write home about.  it's definitely cleaner than most dts which is nice.  located in the square where there really isn't much else, so it does fill a void for little things you need on your list, but don't want to spend some big money on.\u000a\u000aample parking outside.  decent selection that could maybe benefit from a small expansion in items.

Vbakery square or bksq is a new $150 million development on the site of the former nabisco plant in the larimer section of the city by walnut capital of shadyside. to me it's really sad how people are trying to take over and rename urban areas of the city. this area is now know as "eastside" for east liberty and shadyside. \u000a\u000aas of right now there isn't to much open. on june 14, 2010 urban active fitness opened a 47,000 square foot facility the first urban active location in pennsylvania. anthopologie, a women's clothing store is is open. google inc. is moving their cmu office to bakery square as well. pottery barn will be relocating to bakery square from walnut street in shadyside. it will join sister store west elm furniture. there is also a 110-room marriott spring hill suites hotel on site. \u000a\u000aneiman marcus is in talks of opening a mini, smaller version of one their stores on the site as well which would be the second neiman marcus in pennsylvania besides the one in king of prussia. a few restaurants are in the works as well. \u000a\u000aall in all bksq reminds me of a mini south side works. there is a large parking garage in the rear of the property as well. \u000a\u000awe'll see how it goes.

Vi'm hoping that this place will eventually bring more life than what they do right now.  i really want to like it, but it's lacking something.\u000a\u000ai think once they add the residential part across the street that it'll liven up the area even more.  and with that it will probably bring some more interesting and diverse businesses to the area.  \u000a\u000auntil then, this is only a place to come if you have a purpose, not a place to come and hang out.\u000a\u000a(those bikes would be awesome to use if everyone in the city could use them, not just the google employees and cmu students)

Vthere is some cool stuff in here, that's for sure. it's laid out with mostly furniture in the front and mostly clothes, toys, and other small housewares in the back, including old records, electronics, etc. most of their furniture seems to be in great quality.\u000a\u000awhy only 2 stars? first, the reliability - i have come by this place many times on my way through this block of 8th ave only to find them to be closed in the middle of most weekdays. i've mentioned it to others, they all thought it had closed. i imagine i know how peter felt on easter morning when jesus's tomb was open, having come across this store during a time it was open.\u000a\u000asecond - the staff. we walked in, stayed for about 40 minutes, discussed many of the pieces, and even spoke about buying a few(large) pieces and not once did the woman who (owns?) worked behind the desk look up from restoring a small toy. it's one thing if you don't care to be particularly friendly(maybe even a good thing - i walked into mostly mod after and couldn't get out of there in less than 30 minutes because we kept chatting), but to totally ignore potential customers is unacceptable.\u000a\u000aso i left empty handed on principal, although there were a few smaller pieces i could have been coerced into buying. would i stop in again? if i had the option to, yes. maybe it was a bad day, and the stuff is definitely worth looking at.

Vmy husband rick and i were here on saturday night for the john mellencamp concert.  and how uncool is this?   going to a concert with my parents!  hey, both mom and dad are mellencamp fans too, so we made an evening out of it.   once again, this is more of a concert review than a review of the facility.  look out rolling stone magazine!  \u000a\u000ai'm sure most of you are familiar with mellencamp's material, especially his 1980s stuff.  he started off as a young punk (but not a punk rocker) under the name johnny cougar, a name he always despised.  he had a minor hit back in the 70s, "i need a lover" but had a breakthrough with "hurts so good" and "jack and diane".  by then he was known as john cougar.  he hit his stride as john cougar mellencamp with the album "uh-huh" and his best known work, "scarecrow".  he had a string of hit singles including "authority song", "paper in fire", "lonely old night", and "rain on the scarecrow".  his last major single came in the mid-1990s, "key west intermezzo".  by then he dropped the "cougar" name.\u000a\u000aif you went to this show expecting to hear those songs, well you did get some of them.  but this time out, it wasn't about the hits.  mellencamp's show began with a documentary on the making of his new cd, the stripped-down "no better than this" and last year's tour he did at minor-league ballparks (wilco did the same thing this year).  \u000athe new cd was recorded at the legendary sun studios.  about that documentary, i was wondering why the concert starting time was 6:30pm!\u000a\u000awhen mellencamp & co did take the stage, they went right into "authority song", but if you were expecting the usual uptempo rocker, were you in for a surprise!  they did a rockabilly version of that one.  he reinvented some of his other work too--a guitar and fiddle version of "jackie brown" and a honky-tonk version of "jack & diane."  \u000a\u000athe new material got a work out too, and believe me it stands well with some of his best, even if it's a little stark.  "save some time to dream" is an amazing tune as is "the west end".\u000a\u000aartists like john mellencamp and john fogerty may not sell as many cds as they used to.  but isn't it great to hear artists who still pay attention to their crafts and who still can write good material?  instead of others who keep slogging through the same tired old hits year after year.\u000a\u000aand i'm the first to review heinz hall?  s'matter, hasn't anybody ever been here before?

Vreally great hall to hear the symphony. the  balcony has great acoustics as does the front of the downstairs. i don't recommend sitting underneath the balcony. i also enjoy attending the speakers series in the hall. beautiful architecture, great acoustics.  one idea to consider is to eat at the mozart room, a restaurant connected to heinz hall.  it's a way to park early, eat a leisurely dinner, and then pop right into your seats.

Vi remember when this store opened, my ex use to work here and was the store manager upon it's grand opening.  honestly, this place has not changed much, still the same bland selection of clothing for girls (come on now, why don't you carry the heritage brand in here for guys, there is tons of space and you could give up one corner for it).\u000a\u000athe store is showing it's wear.  paint is faded, nicks on the table, cracks in the tile, and so on.  i like urban, street setting stores, but with the selection of stores they have down here at south side works, there are days that it is like walking a barren street.\u000a\u000asave your time girls, go elsewhere to find clothing that will fall to threads in about one wash.

Vi was just discussing the upcoming summer concert season with a chicago yelp guy.  i mentioned the pickings this summer and how i'd likely not be spending a lot of $$ this summer.  i told him, "at least you have jam productions in chicago, so you have some competition."  he then reminded me of the proposed live nation/ticketmaster merger.\u000a\u000aeek!\u000a\u000ano matter what bs live nation tries to cram down our throats about how great this would be for the average concert goer, i'm not convinced.  i guess if you like miley cyrus or whatever the latest flavor of the month is, or if you like your latest prepackaged classic rock/oldies shows, then by all means the live nation/ticketmaster merger will benefit you.  \u000a\u000abut what about the rest of us?  what about those of us who want something else besides bands still coasting on their hits (or hit) of 30 years ago?  what about those of us who don't want to shell out over $100.00 a ticket for the umpteenth eagles reunion show.  and yes, the eagles were the first band to charge over $100.00 per ticket!\u000a\u000aso let's take a look at what live nation is offering us at first niagra pavillion (that's the star lake ampitheater for you old-timers) in summer 2010:   http://www.livenation.com/venue/first-niagara-pavilion-tickets\u000a\u000alet's see:  \u000a\u000a1) styx with foriegner;\u000a2) lynyrd skynyrd god & guns tour w/ bret michaels of poison & 38     special ;\u000a3)  iron maiden \u000a4)  tom petty and the heartbreakers and drive-by truckers (that one would probably be good)\u000a5)  john mayer (i used to like him, now he creeps me out)\u000a6)  jimmy buffett and the coral reefer band (man, how many times do you wanna hear "margaritaville" over and over?).\u000a7)  kings of leon (okay, this one might be good).\u000a\u000awhatever.  i'm getting to the point now where i'd rather see some indie act at a small club or theater for a lot less $$.

Vyou know that old saying? "opinions are like butt holes, everyone has one." well it's defiantly true of peppi's. some people hate it. some people love it. i am a part of the later group. peppi's is a pittsburgh institution that unlike primanti's hasn't sold out yet. \u000a\u000athis location is in a old diner and is rather divey but, who cares? their food is as great as ever. f.y.i. there is a small parking lot in the back. on this particular visit we all got cheese steaks to go. my wife and i both got new yorker's. (steak hoagie with provolone and american cheeses, grilled onions and bacon and we added mushrooms). our daughter got a regular cheese steak. ten minutes later we were on our way. after smelling our hoagies during the whole torturous ride home we destroyed them as soon as we hit the door!\u000a\u000athey were just as good as ever! we all tried to eat just half but, the other half keep calling us so we put them out of their misery and eat the whole thing.

Vthe muddy cup is a refreshing change from all the chain stores.  there's a friendly community feel to the room and they have wonderful coffee and a great selection of teas.  i spoke to the owner, and she was very friendly and enthusiastic.  the food is wonderful, and there is an inviting feel to the place. i love this place!

Vas far as a chain office supply store goes, this place will do.  sometimes it is a little confusing when you come in here looking for an item you would assume would be located in one aisle but is actually half way across the store.  asking a staff member here where this item is located is about as useful as looking online.\u000a\u000athe worst part about this location is that when you enter or exit the store you are hassled by panhandlers.  i assume they get better "tips" over here because no one has the time at neighboring trader joe's.

Vthis is like the little walmart that couldn't.  correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe this use to be just a walmart.  they have attempted to make it a super center.  what a horribly dumb idea.  if hoarders were to do a show that concentrated on establishments, i'm fairly sure this location would be one such location.\u000a\u000ai literally walked around, and around, looking for an item that i passed several times.  stupid me, i guess the logic of organization i have does not pertain to here.  \u000a\u000aplus side here, the sinks work in the men's restroom finally.

Vthis review is really for their drive thru service.  i had called my order in while i was in the plaza at another store.  giving me ample time to finish what i was doing and then head over there before i headed for home.\u000a\u000anever using the drive thru here before i was a bit leery when i used the drive thru lane.  it's quite narrow and hard to maneuver through.  especially since it runs between the building and trash area.\u000a\u000athe food, even though it took me five minutes to get home, was nearly cooled the whole way through.  i know i could have heated it up in the microwave, but i kind of expected it to be at least lukewarm.  this made me think that the twenty minute wait i was to have was an over estimation.\u000a\u000anot even the tiny smiley cookie they gave me could make up for the lackluster meal i received.

Vas i was walking to my car one morning after work i heard a murder of crows cawing and i just knew at that second what i was about to encounter...my car, once blue was now white...i was shit bombed! there was so much bird poop that it smelled like the bat cave at the zoo. to make matters worse, it was cold so the dung was already hard.\u000a\u000ai remembered this place from all my visits to big lots, so i headed over. i was in line for bay #1 when the attendant came over and said "oh, dear! you want to head over to #3"\u000a\u000athe difference is that the first and second bay are high pressure washes only and the third has brushes that go around and above. i was warned that it wasn't going to get 100% of the nastiness off my vehicle, but i didn't expect it to because there was so much. i got the royal treatment which is now $12 but still worth every penny.\u000a\u000ai regret not taking before and after pictures so you could see the difference.

Vunique place to go to eat, buy pottery or host an event.  the staff here is excellent.  the cafe is a good place to go for a salad, sandwich or coffee.  you can take classes in ceramics or stained glass here.  the cost of holding an event here is quite reasonable.  the stained glass is beautiful.

Vsince moving to the burgh from california, i've been on a never ending quest to find decent local tacos. this taco stand outside the grocery store doesn't disappoint! tacos are cheap, authentic, and you get to doctor them up yourself with whatever salsas and toppings your heart desires. so far, i rate these as the most authentic mexican tacos in the pittsburgh area that i've come across. note that as this isn't actually a restaurant, you'll have to stand around outside to eat them, but that's part of the experience. also, if you're afraid of spice, avoid the orange (habanero?) salsa at all cost - it'll knock you flat on your back!

Vthe pizza here is great!  they have tons of specialty pizzas to choose from, many have multiple kinds of cheese.  i have tried mediterannean, vegetarian, and artichoke--all were awesome.  the crust is thick and they put salty feta cheese on top.  i think this is my favorite pizza in pittsburgh so far!!

Vfor our first pizza since moving to pittsburgh, we wanted something simple and inexpensive.  we'll try the aiello's and mineo's later i'm sure, but we were just looking for something standard to curb the pizza craving.\u000a\u000afound a coupon in the mail for a $15.99 combo at pizza bellino - a large pizza and 12 wings.  sold.  i called to place the order, and whoever answered the phone was a bit disorganized.  when he asked to put me "on hold," he clearly just put the receiver down on the counter because i could still hear him yelling at someone and then taking an order from an in-person customer.  i felt like a moron because i kept thinking he was talking to me!  also, after i ordered, he did not take my name or any personal information.  i know it was pick-up, not delivery, but um - shouldn't you get my name?  i tried to ask if he wanted my name but he'd already hung up.  stellar first impression!  not.  (haha. i said "not."  i'm eight years old.)\u000a\u000aso we mosey down the street 20 minutes later for our pizza.  seeing as he didn't have my name, the dude tried to give me a pepperoni pizza with wings, and then we had a brief and confusing verbal exchange where i said i didn't order pepperoni, but i'd take it if they made it by mistake - as long as i didn't have to pay more than the coupon price.  the guy did not seem keen on that idea, but then suddenly he had an epiphany - perhaps there was another pizza in the back - the one i'd actually ordered!  revelation!  and that was what happened.\u000a\u000aat home, we opened up our boxes, ready to chow down.  the pizza was utterly, totally "fine."  it was okay.  it was standard.  it was pizza.  cheese wasn't oozingly melty, there wasn't a luscious smear of homemade sauce, and the crust didn't have those hand-tossed bumps and crevices.\u000a\u000ait was college student pizza.  totally standard, totally satisfying.  the wings were actually a step above - lots of meat on them, and the sauce was pretty hot!  lips and tongue definitely tingling for the rest of the evening.  and of course, cheap (with a coupon at least!)\u000a\u000ai'd get pizza here again - especially if i was ordering for a crowd or a sporting event and didn't want any really gourmet or expensive pizza.  it's probably good drunk pizza too.  the wings i'd definitely order again as well.  it's totally fine pizza, as long as you know what you're getting into.  if you want something above average, look elsewhere.  if you just want crust, cheese, and sauce - this will satisfy your cravings.

Vlunchtime in oakland can be a daunting task.  options are immense here.  when you factor in if there is delivery or not, the number dwindles down some.  while hungry on this particular lunchtime, my coworkers and i decided to try something a little different than what they usually get (thank heavens for that).\u000a\u000aafter riffling through the menus they had stashed at work, they came upon bellino's menu.  after looking it over, and tired from pizza and hoagies, i decided to go with a salad.  not a bad choice to make.  \u000a\u000aunlike your typical pizza place salad, this one actually made me feel full.  maybe it was because of instead of using iceberg lettuce, they went with the mixed greens as the base.  and unlike other pizza places, they actually gave you some good toppings.  cucumbers, green peppers, grape tomatoes, and carrots.  i would have been satisfied if i would have just gotten a regular salad with those toppings.  however i did opt for the popcorn chicken salad which basically voided my healthy eating for the day.  with all the good for you toppings, they added the popcorn chicken, a ton of cheese and french fries (hey, they are still a vegetable ;)).\u000a\u000aoverall, i liked it.  it hit the spot and i wasn't craving anything by the end of my shift at work.  i would definitely give pizza bellino a spot in my folder for their menu.

Vbacon caramel.  yes, bacon caramel! \u000a\u000a some would argue that's all i need to say for this review, but i shall, dear reader, continue.  my husband and i came here because we had a groupon, and honestly, i wasn't expecting much from a hotel restaurant.  boy, was i wrong.  the lobby of the hotel is really cool-- urban and chic-- and the restaurant decor continues in this vein.  the charcuterie plate was the stand out of the evening.  the "small" portion is loaded with cured meats, pates, little pickles and the fabulous bacon caramel.  the caramel was deep brown and sweet, loaded with chunks of thick-cut bacon.  we so enjoyed this first visit that we returned for my hubby's birthday.  all told, we've had the cheese platter (diverse, tasty cheeses), the lobster cassoulet (chock full o' lobster and delicious), seared scallops (cooked perfectly), veal milanese, and the steak frites (delicious fries).\u000a\u000aif i love braddock's so much why don't i marry it and give it 5 stars?  well, the waitresses could be a little more put together.  their uniform is a bulky black shirt with black pants, and a tailored look would go better with the atmosphere.  also, their beers and cocktails, while delicious, can be a bit expensive.  minor gripes, but they're keeping me at a 4.5 star review.

Vmy mom was in town for a conference, and i thought it was the perfect opportunity to use my groupon to braddock's.  a short walk from her hotel on a beautiful day, we strolled in to the lobby of the renaissance hotel to find the restaurant.  what a gorgeous hotel!  it makes me want to wear a long red dress and walk slowly down a staircase to greet a crowd of admirers.  classy place.\u000a\u000athe restaurant has a classy vibe too - leather booths, white tablecloths, and dim lights.  we started with cocktails - alas, the cocktail menu is not on the website (or i'm dumb and can't find it) - but whatever we had, it was delicious.  i believe it was marked as the house specialty cocktail.  i wasn't sure i'd like it because sometimes i'm a little iffy on whiskey, but it was actually fruity and delicious.  we both loved it.\u000a\u000anext, we split the goat cheese and beet salad (which they put on separate plates for us), and it was great.  sweet beets, amazing fried goat cheese, tasty vinaigrette.  oh - and we also got a soft, warm baguette wrapped in paper, with a plate of sweet butter.\u000a\u000afor my entree, i had mussels and frites "billi-bi" style, which means in a saffron-cream broth.  the frites were served with an aioli.  i also had a side of garlic spinach.  the entree didn't bowl me over - mussels were well prepared and the broth was tasty, but it wasn't long before it seemed too rich for me, and became a little hard to eat.  there was just so much broth and it was so creamy!  the spinach did a nice job of cutting through the heavy meal, but the overall effect was still a bit much. \u000a\u000away too full for dessert!  i think our meal came to about $90 (mom got the daily special, a fish dish) - so that's $90 for two drinks, one salad, a side dish, and two entrees.  it's pricey.  the groupon helped. i think i would return though, it made a good impression.  our server felt a bit rushed - she didn't really connect with us and always seemed to be moving quickly, but that's okay.  there weren't many people in the restaurant at all, which was kind of sad on a friday.  more people should give this place a shot!

Vsimply awesomely amazing!\u000a\u000amy friend and i were doing some strip shopping and looking for a place to grab some lunch. we are both vegetarians and weren't really feeling any of the street vendor offerings, then i remembered jb's mum raving about salem's (her office is across the street so it's a frequent lunch spot for her). we decided to give it a go.\u000a\u000amy friend ordered a falafel which i was quite jealous of, it looked and smelled heavenly. the falafel was the size of a baby and it came with a separate pita and small container of hummus. i will definitely be returning for one in the near future. as for me, i opted for the veggie curry. i received a generous serving of basmati rice blanketed with garbanzos, carrots, and onions in a rich curry sauce. it was definitely enough to satisfy two meals. i also ordered jb a lamb shwarma to-go, an hour later it was still warm and didn't require reheating. after he ate the entire thing his reply was "that is one delicious lamb...in my belly!"

Vnothing special. \u000ai had cheesey bread sticks and a five cheese pizza delivered, the delivery guy gave me attitude because it was near closing (it was a half hour before hand which i thought was reasonable). the sauce is bland and so is the crust and my bread sticks were plain. when i say plain, i mean they didn't even put garlic butter on them let alone the cheese i paid extra for. i'm certain this was done on purpose, oh well! next time i'm in pinch for a late night pie, i will take my business elsewhere.

Vbig mama has moved from her take out only location in the strip district to a bigger and better location in downtown pittsburgh. they are now located across the street from the august wilson center in the old steel city diner on liberty avenue. there is now plenty of seating but, it gets crowded at lunch time. i especially like the gospel music playing as you walk in. \u000a\u000athey now offer breakfast which consists of fish & grits, chicken & waffles, french toast, huge pancakes, omelettes and sandwiches. \u000a\u000athey offer pulled pork sandwiches, ribs, smothered pork chops, baked, barbecued, delicious fried and jerk chicken.\u000a\u000atheir sides consists of baked beans, collard greens, cornbread, green beans, mac & cheese, candied yams, seafood stuffing, mashed potatoes, rice , potato salad and linguine salad.\u000a\u000adesserts are peach cobbler and sweet potato pie.\u000a\u000ai highly recommend the fried chicken. the mac & cheese is so so and the potato salad is decent.\u000a\u000aif you go for lunch be advised it takes a while to get your food as everything is cooked when you order it. i would only eat in if  you have an hour for lunch.\u000a \u000ams brenda aka big mama is such a sweet woman! i wish her all the best!

Vbig mama has closed her restaurant for good due to fines and parking issues with the city of pittsburgh. she stated on the front door that she may be moving to the washington dc area. now that is a tough market for soul food! check out a & j's ribs in market square. their food is just as good.\u000a\u000abig mama will be missed.

Vperfect place for a romantic date!  didn't have dinner here (ate next door instead) but had a few pre-meal cocktails each and really enjoyed them!  the room is dimly lit, and there are comfortable chairs and candles throughout.  the atmosphere is cozy and intimate.  \u000a\u000ai had a glass of champagne first, from their very nice selection.  all their champagnes are dry - i had the sweetest one and it was still barely sweet at all but still very nice.  my next cocktail was basically an elderflower gin and tonic which i loved.  the last cocktail i had was something called the dutch courage (i think, can't find the list online) and it was my least favorite.  a strong orangey flavor in there that was a bit too cloying for me.  my boyfriend enjoyed his masculine cocktails and we both nibbled on tasty olives.  though beware, the olives come literally in a bowl of oil - when you bring one up to your face, it will drip - on your trousers, as he learned!  the cocktails are indeed presented beautifully, with interestingly shaped ice cubes and clear precision from whoever is behind the bar.\u000a\u000ai will say that we hoped they would be a bit stronger.  two cocktails and champagne for me, three cocktails for him, and we both felt barely buzzed.  not that the point is to be drunk, of course, but you know...would've been a plus!  but i suppose the good thing is that you can come and try lots of cocktails without being on the floor!  prices were better than i thought too - champagne was pricey per glass but many of the cocktails were only 4 or 5 pounds.\u000a\u000awould return anytime for a drink and a snack!  so glad my friend told me about it as we could easily have walked right by!

Vit's hard to believe just how much this area of the north side has come of age in the past few years.  i'm surprised in a way at all the little coffee houses, etc, that have come in here.  \u000a\u000aanyway one of my subordinates, a colleague from another sub-agency,  and i had to come up this way "on official business"*.  we all decided to stop in for a little shot of the caffeine beforehand.  buena vista is a little gem of a coffee shop.  it's cozy and very inviting.  i only had black coffee, which was really good mind you, but one of our party had some coffee cake with his.  he said it tasted like it was freshly baked and not at all like it had been shipped in a cardboard box the night before.  \u000a\u000agreat place and worth checking out if you're in this area and you need that second shot of morning "pick me up".\u000a\u000a*believe me, this "official business" wasn't as glamorous as it seems!

Vi like to go get coffee at buena vista.  it's right down the street from my house, but their brewed coffee is so good that i will often walk here rather than make my own at home.\u000a\u000athey also have an assortment of pastries in the morning, the "good morning" muffins are my favorite.\u000a\u000athis place has a definite neighborhood vibe.  i've been here when someone was practicing flute, i've seen dogs with their people at the indoor tables...if that kind of thing bothers you, you might not enjoy buena vista, but i do.

Vfood is ok; beer selection is good.  i was surprised not to see your typical budweiser/coors/yuengling selection, but rather a few of rivertowne's lighter brews and a wide selection of heavier craft beers.\u000a\u000aon wednesdays any rivertowne beer s $3, boneless wings are 50 cents, and jumbo wings are 75 cents.  (i think this is from 7-10pm.)  they have other daily specials as well, but we were here on a wednesday.  we tried mild, fire, and cajun bourbon flavors--my advice would be to stick to the classic buffalo/hot sauces.  \u000a\u000amy husband and i watched the whole first pens playoff game here (we sure picked a good time to move and therefore be out cable for a week, eh?) and our waitress was the perfect balance of attentive and laid back. she let us hang out and watch the game, but also made sure we had everything we needed.\u000a\u000aoverall, i would recommend this place if you're at the north shore already, but maybe not if you have to go very far to get here--it's a typical pub scene and parking can be a bit of a pain.

Vthis may be the best indian i have ever had.  i've had several curries on this long trip, but wow - this one wins the prize.  they are also byob, which is fairly common in the states at asian and indian restaurants, but perhaps not as much here?  so it was a very nice treat to bring loads of wine and beer for the group.  dimly lit, casual atmosphere, and friendly service.  there were about ten of us in a group, but everything went really smoothly.\u000a\u000astarted with some delicious chicken pakoras with a few different sauces, then followed it up with the chicken deshi khani and a side of the best, freshest sag alu i've ever had.  the deshi khani is advertised as being "limited availability," and a special, particularly authentic curry.  spicy, rich, and succulent, it was one of the best curries i've ever had.  and the sag alu!  not the fatty (but delicious) creamy spinach you usually get at indian restaurants, this was fresh and brimming with spice.  would've been happy to get it as a main with paneer, but i didn't think to do so because i figured it would be pretty standard instead of spectacular, and i was wrong!\u000a\u000amy friend ordered something they used to serve but is no longer printed on the menu and they still make it for her.  fragrant pilau rice and hot, crispy garlic naan made this such an outstanding meal.  i'd beeline here the next time i was in edinburgh because as far as i'm concerned, this is as good as indian gets.

Vtwo of us just ordered two 10" sammiches (buffalo chicken and turkey 'lite'), cole slaw, and a salad with sesame-peanut dressing from foodler.com. \u000a\u000athis was the most perfect delivery food i've ever been lucky enough to order.  the sandwiches were perfect.  the salad was perfect, with great dressing, and onions sliced incredibly thinly so they weren't ever overpowering.  the cole slaw went together with the buffalo sauce really, really well.\u000a\u000ait also got here early.\u000a\u000athis might be my favorite place for a sandwich from now on out.

Vif it were possible to give a place no stars or negative stars, i'd hand out -100 stars to this fine establishment.  i've never dealt with a more unprofessional business such as here.  very rude, especially if  you call an order in.  i can understand having an attitude if you had stellar food, but sorry grinders, you do not.  knock it back a few notches.\u000a\u000alet me recount a story for you.  ordered here, quite a bit of food, wasn't just one or two items to be delivered, this was an order for several people.  called the order in, added up the amount that would be needed to cover the bill, factored in tax and tip as well.  when given my price from them on the phone it was $6 more.  i didn't think twice about it at first.  a few minutes later i needed to add an item to our order and called back, not only was it like i was wasting their valuable time, but it was the biggest inconvenience for them to have to take care.  i was unaware that you didn't want to make more money...  since i had them on the phone i asked about the extra $6...guess to them it's a-okay to charge you a $6 delivery fee and expect you to still tip the driver afterward.\u000a\u000athe phone call was filled with lots of rudeness from the employee on the other end, so much that i had to hang up on him and just pray to god my food wouldn't be tampered with.  the next day i sent a complaint via their website and got a generic response back saying something along the lines that these are franchised stores and you would need to contact that store.  ha, that was laughable.  my complaint was probably properly filed in the toilet after a nice wipe, never heard back from them.\u000a\u000athat just means they'll never hear from me again for an order, and to this day i tell anyone that will listen to not order from such a rude establishment.

Vi decided to do a little shopping while visiting edinburgh.  i wandered into debenham's not knowing what to expect.  i suppose that if i lived in edinburgh, my review might have been different.  but i didn't find anything here that i couldn't get at macy's and not have to ship or schlep home.\u000a\u000ait's a bit of a maze and it's layout isn't the greatest.  still, it was kind of neat just looking around.  i did manage to stop for coffee at the little cafe they have here.

Vi recently ordered szechuan tofu, the small portion cost me $6 and change plus tip. the rice was nice and fluffy instead of sticky and clumped together. the veggies still had crunch and the tofu was fried nicely. dress all that deliciousness up with a sweet and spicy sauce and you've got yourself fantastic meal! the service was extremely friendly and fast.

Vthe green mango owners recently opened up an outpost at the waterfront.  it's tiny, with two tables and bar stools, and they have a limited menu, but it's great for grabbing something to eat once your errands are finished.  \u000a\u000athey have a limited menu: two soups, four appetizers, two salads, sandwiches and entrees and a few curries.  i grabbed a pumpkin and tofu curry, which the girl whipped up in about five minutes, maybe less.  it was $6.95, and the portion was a bit smaller than those in the full-service restaurant, but i'm happy to pay a bit extra for the convenience of being able to grab some thai food while i'm on the go.  they also sell a lot of drinks and some imported snacks like pocky.  \u000a\u000ai'm not sure of their hours, but check them out if you're at the waterfront around lunchtime.  they provide a nice halfway point between the convenience of fast food and the quality of a sit-down restaurant.

Vcannon coffee is the first part of a new non-profit where the owner intends to set up coffee shops in various neighborhoods of pittsburgh and reinvest the earnings in the community. the next installments will likely be in sheraden and beechview.\u000a\u000aas to the shop itself, the prices are decent, the coffee is good, and the baristas are extremely friendly. it's an independent coffee shop that provides all of the benefits you would expect an independent shop to provide(many in pittsburgh are guilty of not fulfilling their role!). the decor is fun, old looking mix-and-match chairs and tables. a patio for smokers and non-smokers to share the fresh air. a piano that can be played, usually some other instruments hanging about as well.\u000a\u000aevery wednesday night they have an open mic at 8.

Vthis is quite frankly one of the finest modern art museums i've ever seen in my life. housed in an imposing neo-classical building, which was designed by william burn in 1825, it moved to this site on belford road in 1984. \u000a\u000aright now they are celebrating their 50th anniversary, so i recommend you don't miss this museum. they've currently rehung a lot of their works and they're currently featuring "what you see is where you're at". i'm not much of an art critic, but i did enjoy the "super realism" exhibit, which showed how pop art renewed interest in photographic realism, and american popular culture. \u000a\u000abut i think i enjoyed the young scottish painter exhibit, which over the next several months will showcase three emerging scottish painters: alex dordoy, sophie mackfall and alan stanners. it's a pleasure to discover the works of new artists. while we have an outstanding art museum in my native pittsburgh, the carnegie, i often wish we had something a little more dedicated to modern and contemporary art. \u000a\u000athe building grounds here are simply gorgeous! the layout of the building is very logical. and the facility itself is simply stunning.

Vwe wanted to like this place, really we did.  and there a lot of things to like - cozy ambiance, friendly service, awesome beignets.  but the food was, in our opinion, just "meh."\u000a\u000awe came here for brunch on a sunday morning and tried the zucchini risotto cakes and the french toast.  the french toast was better than the risotto cakes, which had a crispy exterior so crispy that it was like chewing on ... i dunno, rocks?  definitely beyond the crispy stage and moving into the rock stage.  anyway, so that wasn't so great, but the french toast was legitimately tasty.  was it $11 tasty?  i guess where it goes wrong (for me) is that i used to get a stuffed french toast from dozen (back when they were open) that was seriously good stuff that probably cost about the same.  so... in the matchup against good ole dozen's sunday brunch, this couldn't compare.  and that made me sad.  =(\u000a\u000awe're game to give it another try, but it's just a meh to us.  we'd rather go to casbah or frick cafe.

Vwe went with a party of 4 and had quite an amazing evening.  our food was creative, fresh, local and cooked to perfection.  i like that you can mix and match appetizers, that way everyone gets something they like and everybody shares. the wait staff was extremely friendly, attentive and helpful.  i can't wait to go back again.

Vso, our first time to e2, we were underwhelmed. we came for brunch, and while parts of the meal were pretty good, the overall experience wasn't good enough to get us to come back.\u000a\u000asome friends mentioned that e2 was doing dinners, and suggested that we give it another try. and, we are glad we did. they specialize in pastas, which is perfect for those of us who are vegetarian. the pastas are fresh and delicious. they are not meat heavy, so if you are looking for that, go across the street to joseph tambellini's. otherwise, the food is good, the service is lovely, and the ambiance is cozy and nice. a very nice addition to the growing highland park restaurant landscape.

Vfinally went here for brunch today after having it on the to do list for over a year. on a saturday morning, they were able to seat us immediately without a wait which was unexpected but pleasant. the interior is small and cozy, and the waitstaff were friendly.\u000a\u000aas appetizers, they have a variety of interesting donut flavors available. we tried the caramel ones which were among the best donuts i've ever had. amazing. these aren't your standard donuts - they are little balls of deliciousness and come five to an order covered with toppings.\u000a\u000aneither of us was as impressed with the actual brunch food. it was good, but on the heavy side and not overly remarkable. i probably wouldn't go out of my way to have brunch here again, but i would definitely go back for the donuts.

Vgiven that two of my colleagues have already written about their experience here, it seems a little much to weigh in here, but here goes anyway.\u000a\u000ai wasn't wowed by habitat - it's a swanky place to take clients if you're stuck downtown and can't get anywhere else more interesting.  the hotel itself is really nicely done - our guest was shocked that we could have such a nice hotel in pittsburgh (although i think that says more about pittsburgh than it does about the hotel).  the entrance to the restaurant is rather unassuming, and the host podium is oddly situated.  it's neither right in front of the door, nor is it off to the side.  someone did not get the flow on that entry right.\u000a\u000aanyway, nobody was at the host podium when we arrived, which was a little shocking.  however, i liked the wait staff, and especially enjoyed the open kitchen concept.  the food is good, but not spectacular.  i didn't find it particularly inventive, and it was almost certainly a little overpriced.  however, the quality of ingredients were top notch.\u000a\u000ait's a place to go to see and be seen.  they do the whole local, sustainable thing, which is fantastic, although one might wonder why it is so expensive if it didn't have to come very far.  i will also say that one huge detraction is the acoustics - it is super loud in here.  for a place that is supposed to be tastefully modern, that doesn't seem consistent with the ambiance.\u000a\u000ai'll also mention that the bathrooms are awfully far away.  again, i think whoever the architect was didn't plan for a lot of these small little details, and it's unfortunate that they have to find out about it after the fact.

Vthe food was decent, and the servers were attentive. i'm lowering the rating because for the price, i don't think it was quite worth it - i've had better food, or certainly comparable food for much less money at other fine pittsburgh establishments. habitat also felt a little snooty to me - i probably won't be back for another $120 two person meal anytime soon. i had the halibut, and while it was fine, i didn't love the way they prepared it.

Vok, i am upgrading my rating for habitat. when we first went here, almost two years ago to the day, they were working out their opening kinks. but now, they are a much smoother operation. i am a fan of the whole locally sourced commitment, and they have very interesting taste combinations. they also dabble in the whole molecular gastronomy thing, which is always fun.\u000a\u000ayou know how sometimes hosts/hostesses can seem both solicitous and snobby at the same time? the host here seemed to walk that fine fine line between seeming like he was used to dealing with high status clientele and that he wasn't sure which class we should be categorized in. we were probably among the first diners that night, so maybe he hadn't gotten into the spirit of things yet, but i felt like i had been weighed, measured, and found wanting. that being said, he didn't do anything overtly to make me feel bad, but... anyway, just a heads up. \u000a\u000abut our actual server was incredibly gracious, and we enjoyed talking with him. we started with compressed watermelon with prosciutto, which was really divine. i haven't had watermelon in so long, and this was like a breath of fresh (spring/summer) air. hubby had the burger, which was also quite good, and i went with the wild sea bass, which was excellent (and also about 3x more expensive than the burger... eh?!?! what is going on when wild caught fish is 3x more expensive than locally sourced grass fed beef?).  \u000a\u000aoverall, we really enjoyed habitat. the service was nice, and the atmosphere wasn't as pretentious as it was last time. but, it was really expensive for what it was. that is, there are so many more options in pittsburgh that give the same level of quality of food for less that it's hard to rationalize coming here. but if you are on an expense account and want to impress a client, by all means, habitat is an excellent choice.

Vwhoooo-hoooooo hand drawn noodles are da bomb and this place didn't disappoint. \u000a\u000achinese dumplings were some of the best i've ever had (including mainland china). the filling was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of ginger and garlic. \u000a\u000athe soup with noodles was to die for, it's not pho people (other yelpers have confused it) it's chinese soup and they pulled off the broth perfectly. the stir-fried noodles had a wee bit too much sesame oil imho but they were still very yummy.\u000a\u000aservice was spot on and friendly. watermelon and mango smoothies were super delicious. \u000a\u000aprice - great value, wish we had this place where i lived.

Vone of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in! \u000a\u000amy wife and i decided to have a "romantic weekend" close to home and chose the fairmont hotel. great choice! the lobby is very cosy and spacious. i like that fact that you have to have a room key to get to the rooms. our room was quiet and had great views of downtown pittsburgh and pnc park. they even supply in room binoculars that you came buy for $150 if you would like to keep them. \u000a\u000amy only true complaint is that we requested a king bed room well in advance but all they had available were double queen bed rooms when we checked in. :( the room was well laid out and reminded me of the rooms at wynn las vegas. the bathroom is nice with a separate tub and shower. lots of towels and soft bath robes. i just wish they offered a tv in the bathroom and slippers like wynn as i left mine at home by mistake. \u000a\u000athe tv was a phipps hdtv with true hd channels. the bed was heavenly! it was either a sealy or serta. i can't remember. i haven't slept good like that in a long time. the in room bar had everything that you could possibly need to get you night off to a good start including a bottle of wine and two glasses. (insider tip: there is a wine & spirits store directly across the street on liberty avenue next to fifth avenue place.) there are tons of treats and snacks in the room also. \u000a\u000athe closet only had a few hangers that we had to share but, has a good bit of storage with plenty of shelves and a in room safe that was too small for my 17.3" laptop. \u000a\u000athe desk had tons of inputs that work with the tv like 3.5mm audio, hdmi, iphone/ipod inputs, inputs for video game consoles, usb chargers, vga connectors and plenty of electrical outlets. \u000a\u000athey also offer a saks fifth avenue shopping experience great for the out of town fashionista of well dressed metrosexual. \u000a\u000aall in all a great place to stay while in pittsburgh!

Vwell i finally got my receiver fixed. i'm not going to pretend that i'm an audio expert, and thus i won't talk about things i don't know. my story is as follows: i own an old kenwood kr-7050 receiver. i noticed it didn't work after a particularly crammed car ride up to state college(but not to say i knew it worked before). it powered on, but no sound came out.\u000a\u000ai took it to atlas audio repair around noon one day. the kid behind the counter told me it was $40 to get it looked at, but that $40 would be taken off the cost of the repair  if i got it fixed with them. fair enough, i paid and got a claim check. \u000a\u000aat 3pm that day, i was called and told my estimate was ready. i called back and they said it would be $138, minus the $40 i had already paid. i didn't know anything about the stuff, so i said ok. he said it would be done tomorrow.\u000a\u000asure enough, tomorrow they gave me a call and told me it was done. i couldn't go in that day, so i went in this morning and picked it up. it was wrapped tightly in plastic and the kid held the door for me on the way out.\u000a\u000awhen i got home, it worked! i noticed that a few of the switches on my model were bent, but they bent right back into place easily - so i am not sure if it was done by the tech, the plastic, or by my own transportation.\u000a\u000asince i don't know about how much this stuff should cost, i will list what they claim to have replaced and you can make your own judgement:\u000a2 regulators\u000a1 lamp\u000aclean + something(can't read)\u000a$138.00

Vthe north shore trail is a part of the great allegheny passage and the three rivers heritage trail.  the address i gave you is an apporximation.  it's where my husband rick and i picked up the trail on herr's island.  it's a multi-use trail running along the north shore of the allegheny and ohio rivers.  it ends at roughly westhall street on the north side, opposite brunot's island.  it's about six miles in length.\u000a\u000ait's really more of a connector trail and you can see some good riverscapes (if such a word exists) and urban landscape.  you can use it to reach heinz field and pnc park.  it's good for bike commuting too.  it's not the greatest trail in the world, but worth it if you want to get a short ride in.

Vwell with some unexpected dry weather, i decided it was time to get my road bike out, pack some snacks (and my insulin kit), strap on my helmet, and get a decent ride in.  i tell ya, when you haven't been on your bicycle in a few months, you work out leg muscles you forgot you had!  \u000a\u000ai basically rode from squirrel hill, through schenley park, down to the eliza furnace trail, then over the hot metal bridge to the great allegheny passage trail over to station square and then to the north shore.  i used the north shore trail to return.  \u000a\u000athe north shore trail runs between the velspar corporation on westhall street and herr's island, going past the stadiums.  it's really still a connector trail, paralleling the ohio and allegheny rivers.  it's a fairly pleasant ride, not overly exciting nor exerting, but still pleasant.\u000a\u000aall in all i got about 20 miles in--not too shabby for my second ride of the season.

Vi'm giving the great allegheny passage four stars for what it will eventually become.  it's part of a trail system that will eventually connect pittsburgh with cumberland, md and the c&o canal path to washington, dc.  there is a gap between the southside and west homestead and again to mckeesport (more about that in a moment).  it is long the goal of mine (and my husband rick) to bike it all the way to cumberland and possibly washington.\u000a\u000aas it is now, the trail can be used as a connector, for commuting, or a good way to spend an afternoon cycling, using the connecting trail.  my husband rick and i returned home on it, after biking the north shore trail (also a part of the system) from herr's island to the north side. \u000a\u000athe address i gave you above is the unofficial trailhead.  we picked up the trail at station square.  like the north shore trail, it passes through urban landscapes, parkland, and riverscapes.  it goes past a lot of pittsburgh's industrial past, including the former j&l steel mill site.  in fact, it can be used to connect station square with the south side works theater.  we rode it as far as hot metal street because at present, the trail appears to dead end just west of the glenwood bridge.  the duck hollow trail picks up on the other side of the river and the glenwood bridge, but presently they are not connected.  plans are afoot to link them.\u000a\u000athis would be great because it would save us the long climb up boundary street and four mile run road (pant, pant!) on our way back.  we did connect with the eliza furnace trail and then up the aforementioned streets to schenley park.\u000a\u000aas i mentioned, this will be a great trail system once completed.  get out and ride or hike sometime.

Vgreat news pittsburgh cyclists!  the last mile or so of the great allegheny passage trail has been completed!  you no longer have to try and bypass the area around sandcastle.  for the first time, a complete trail ride from pittsburgh to cumberland is now possible.  actually, if you're really ambitious you can connect in cumberland to the c&o canal path, you could ride uninterrupted to the national mall in washington, dc.\u000a\u000ahmm, do i sense a challenge here?  perhaps a vacation idea for me and my husband rick?\u000a\u000awell my first ride on the new segment was considerably less grandiose.  i rode from my house in squirrel hill via schenley park, the panther hollow trail, the eliza furnace trail, the hot metal bridge, and the south side trail (which is part of the gap trail) to homestead--a distance of about 9 miles.  i would have liked to have gone down to mckeesport, but it was just a little hot out-not too bad though- and i didn't want to overdo it.  i brought extra water and i rode at a reduced pace.\u000a\u000aas i rode through the new segment i  thought, "it doesn't get any better than this".  i thought of all the years of hard work, all of the trail groups coming together, and all of the money wisely invested in this tremendous public asset.  it was well worth the wait.\u000a\u000aoh, my bike and i road the bus home from homestead.  it was after all a very warm day.

Vwow! talk about strange! \u000amy boyfriend and i stopped in on one of the first nice days of the season, because it was so beautiful we seated ourselves outside. between the menu and the daily specials it was difficult to decide what to order. after a lot of thought i decided to go for (this is where it get strange, as i read the 1st review i experienced deja vu) butternut squash lasagna and my companion followed the advice of our waitress and ordered the eggplant parm on top polenta and a bed of lemony spinach. everything was absolutely delicious. the lasagna was so creamy and cooked to perfection. the sprig of fresh basil on top was a nice and refreshing touch. justin's eggplant was also transcendent - my first experience eating polenta was lackluster and kind of scared me off for a bit but after eating tfc's i'm totally a fan. the combination of the slightly sweet sauce, tartness of the lemon spinach and melted cheese was incredible. i can't wait to go back.

Vattending a show at the nearby carnegie music hall and not wanting to eat at the nearby  water-(let's-buy-goods-made-in-china-in-chain-stores-located-on-the-site-where-a-steel-mill-that-paid-union-wages-used-to-be) front, i decided to stop here for a bite beforehand.  i've got nothing against chain restaurants, but i needed a little break from your p.f. chang's and dave & busters of the world.  \u000a\u000abut be advised--tin front is a vegetarian, but by no means vegan place.  a lot of their stuff has eggs and/or cheese.  me, i went for the apple & cheddar grilled cheese with a side of home fries & red peppers.  no i'm not switching to a vegetarian diet, but who'd ever thought that vegetarian chow could be comfort food?\u000a\u000atin front doubles up as a coffeehouse too, so i'm gonna have to come back here some time for some joe.

Vthis location has been everything from a bp gas station to a drivethru rallys/ checkers hamburger location. it is now a decent little automatic car wash with five do it your self bays and two touch less automatic bays that do a good job. if your vehicle is excessively dirty spray it off in one of the do it yourself bays first and bring your own tire and wheel cleaner so they will be extra clean.

Vnice to walk around in the summer time but it's a real bummer in cold & rainy weather. has a shop for everyone. the theater is beautiful and has special deals from time to time. great places to eat whether you're in the mood for a quick bite or a sit down meal, classy or casual.

Va decent selection of guys clothes that aren't all smalls? in-house tailoring? good prices, local shopping, indie designers?\u000apageboy has it all, it's a really cool shop run by some really cool people. there is also a salon in the back, but i haven't used it. also, they recently celebrated their 1-year anniversary with 20%+ off most items and a lot of $10 items - most of which were not taken off the sale racks(i don't think anyways). also, they had free beer and awesome food from e-squared to celebrate - just to let you know that pageboy takes care of their customers.

Vyeah, yeah, yeah!  i know--the irony of a non-drinker going to a beer emporium for lunch.  hey, i may not imbibe but that doesn't mean i don't like the occasional repast of good pub chow.  i went with my coworker maria and to be fair, there are strict rules against alcohol consumption during business hours.\u000a\u000abut o-my the food here is good, if a little expensive!  maria and i began by splitting an order of wild mushrooms & leek tarts.  picture a baked pastry filled with beer braised leeks, chives and shallots!  mmmm, baked pastry. pump that insulin, susan!  pump!  i was considering the flemish onion soup when suddenly the belgian burger caught my eye.   oh baby, that burger was to die for!  ground lamb & beef with shallots & bacon, topped with melted smoked gouda!  \u000a\u000aso i guess my burger was gouda 'nuff!

Vi'm sure that if you like beer and you come for the beer, this place is going to be great for you. if you are coming for food, and especially if you are vegetarian, this place is to be avoided. it's just incredibly overpriced for the quality of food.\u000a\u000ahusband had the mystery beer, which he thought was meh. we started with the crab stuffed artichokes, which were legitimately tasty. then, a salad and salmon burger to share. the salad was really one of the sadder things we have ever seen. lots of lettuce, little to no toppings, and the grilled portobello mushroom was small and shriveled, rather than plump and juicy. the salmon burger was fine, but nothing to write home about. at the end of the day, the tab came to a little over $50, which just seems ridiculous, given the quantity and quality of food. we won't be going back.

Vgreat place for live jazz. the musicians are always top notch. the wine list is somewhat limited,  but there are some very good choices on the list. this is a fun place to visit and it's quite elegant. they have recently extended the number of evenings for live music from tuesday to saturday evening.  no cover charge.

Vthis is one of those bars that makes me think, "you know, pittsburgh isn't some two-bit town with nothing to do and bland food and drinks." it is swanky up in here, and i like it!\u000a\u000aandy's is so named after mr warhol, and the theme carries through the decorations and drinks. the bar is located in the lobby of the lovely fairmont hotel, which is sleek and modern, without being cold. we stopped in here on nye to grab a drink before heading off to another place to have additional drinks, and were quite delighted by the live jazz and thoughtful cocktails. i had a bellini manhattan and the hubby had a maple syrup infused old fashion. the bellini manhattan was delish-- loved it. the old fashion was good-- strong, and you could taste the maple syrup on the back end. neil said he liked trying it once, but would want a traditional old fashion to drink all night. service was attentive, and we got to valet park for nye for $15 when there were zero spots available downtown. all in all, a success!

Vthis place gets a solid 5 stars for everything - the delicious, authentic kubideh, and the incredible concept behind the take-out storefront.\u000a\u000aas others have said, conflict kitchen features authentic, inexpensive food from a nation that the us is in conflict with.  rights now it's iran - afghanistan is next, and i hear venezuela might be in the works!\u000a\u000awhen you place an order, it takes a while since the delicious kubideh is cooked to order.  the woman working at the window engages passersby in conversation about iran, expanding our knowledge and bashing stereotypes.  even the wrapper that contains the kubideh is printed with insightful interviews from local iranians, offering us a glimpse into their culture and a chance to examine our prejudices.\u000a\u000aan ingenious idea, executed perfectly.  loved it!  can't wait to try afghanistan!

Vthey've changed to afghanistan!  at long last!\u000a\u000anow they serve bolani - which is like a pocket of flatbread filled with vegetarian deliciousness, and cooked to crispy perfection.  last week when i stopped by, they had two flavors: spinach/leek, and red lentil - both delicious.  especially the lentil.  they're going to have two more flavors soon (or maybe they already do) - pumpkin, and something else.  all vegetarian.  all made to order, hot and fantastic.  rock on.  you can get one for $3, or two for $5.  one is enough if you are just a little hungry, or if you have other things to snack on during the day - two is a filling lunch, you won't need anything else.  and i haven't tried this, but a coworker said they don't reheat well in the microwave, so only order what you want to eat right then.\u000a\u000ago enjoy the inexpensive, authentic tastiness!

Vthe sad, icky ghost of mr. willy's did not curse sababa!  the owners have really transformed this space, and the food-- the food!  the falafel was so fresh and crispy and not greasy.  the hummus had a great texture, and the pita bread was warm and poufy.  the main courses come with rice, majadra or fries, and you get fresh grilled veggies.  my shwarma was really delicious.  the baklava is made in more of an israeli fashion than the lebanese-style baklava i've had before, but it was still pretty good.\u000a\u000awhile we were eating the cook/owner came out to greet us and was really welcoming.  they're byob, but didn't charge us a corkage fee for our bottle of wine.  my kind of place!

Vwe kept being thwarted in our attempts to go to sababa.  other plans would come up, or they'd be closed for passover, but finally the stars aligned and we went in on a saturday to use my groupon (before it expired in like, a week.  down to the wire).  we were hungry early, so i think we were there around 545ish.\u000a\u000athere weren't too many people in the restaurant, so we got to pick where we sat, and we took a table by the window.  the server opened up our bottle of wine and brought out some glasses (byob with $5 corkage fee).  the room was brightly colored, sunny from the big windows, and inviting.  we made our selections - hummus sababa, the falafel platter, and chicken shwarma.\u000a\u000ahummus sababa came out first - it was regular hummus, with a pool of olive oil, some chopped parsley, lemon, whole chickpeas, and a quartered hard boiled egg.  jazzed-up hummus.  it was served with four hot, puffy pitas, and we loved it.  the pita was different - thicker and fluffier than usual - turns out they get it shipped from israel!  they'll sell it to you to take home for 80 cents a pita, and i recommend you get yourself a little bag.\u000a\u000athe falafel platter was also delicious - like everyone says, the falafel is fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  i think there is cilantro chopped up inside it because the inside is green, which makes it look awesome.\u000a\u000ai was a big fan of the chicken shwarma.  not the most creative entree choice i know, but i was totally validated for my boringness when i saw how not boring the shwarma was.  it was flavorful, bursting with spice, and crispy!  as if it had just come off a grill.  served over mild mujadra (lentils and rice) with delicious grilled vegetables (love that smoky taste), i was in heaven.  we took some home, and it made nommy leftovers.\u000a\u000athe prices are a smidge high, but the portions are pretty big and it's overall much fresher and tastier than most middle eastern food.  maybe it's because it's israeli as opposed to the usual lebanese, but it tasted different, and special somehow.  it's so great to know we have this place in our neighborhood, it'd be perfect to take friends and family for a nice meal out.

Vjust popped in again to say we got takeout from here, and it was still delicious.  we also tried the "kababa" which i think was like a kofte kabab, ground herbed meat wrapped around a skewer.  it was delicious and pretty juicy.  the schwarma, mujadara, and hummus sababa continue to be good as well.  so eat here.  order confidently.  carry on.

Vmy husband and i loved this place when it first opened.  like, seriously loved it.  we came here pretty frequently because their chicken is addictive.  dark, juicy, perfectly seasoned meat that was prepared fresh, all wrapped up in a fluffy pita... just thinking about it makes me want to cry and salivate at the same time.\u000a\u000abut recently, sababa has been letting us down.  whenever we get the chicken shishlik (or however you actually spell it), sometimes the pita doesn't seem fresh (it's started to go hard) or the amount of chicken to pita is off (not enough chicken) or, and this is the worse part, the chicken would be tough in places, indicating that it was probably cooked a while ago and just reheated.  i know that one of the issues is that when they first opened, the chicken took forever, because it was made to order.  but it was worth the wait!  now, i think they precook some stuff and just throw it together.  and it simply isn't as good.  so, slowly, we've given up on it.\u000a\u000ai'm going to give you one more try sababa.  don't disappoint me again.\u000a\u000aone thing to note - the chicken is pricey.  but, given how good it is/was, we were more than willing to pay it.

Vthere is a sign above the stage and above the bar that says "absolutely no covers". that alone gets this place 5 stars - giving a thriving scene to musicians that create their own work. the ceiling and walls are lined with drum heads and broken cymbals of bands who have rolled through - look hard and you'll see some names that would sell out stage ae these days. smoking is a downside, but it's hard to complain about it in a place like this. if you like rock, come on out. the drinks are cheap, too.\u000a\u000aalso, i love the electronic sign above the bar that scrolls through "fuck *your favorite place here*". some of the names on the list shut down years ago - that just makes it even better.

Vthe almond croissants are one of the best pastries i've ever experienced! they're unbelievable when fresh out of the oven. this small french bakery serves up delicious pastries, sandwiches, and breads on butler street. if you've never had a sandwich for breakfast before, try one of these and you won't be disappointed. even though the ingredients are relatively simple, e.g. ham and cheese, the excellent bread makes all the difference. \u000a\u000ahighly recommended, although be aware that it's a popular location so there may be a line. also, they tend to sell out of popular items such as the aforementioned almond croissants, so go early if you want some. it's a good thing i live across town from this, otherwise i'd come by a little too often!

Voh my! this place is great!\u000a\u000amy girls and i went on a sunny saturday morning this past summer. surprisingly the line wasn't out the door. we were all overwhelmed by the variety of choices from such a small space. the pastries are out of this world! the pain au chocolat ou chocolatine (flaky pastry with chocolate barres.) is without a doubt my favorite pastry that they offer. they also offer danishes, croissants, individual little pastries, cakes, tarts and so much more. everything i tried was delicious. they also offer coffee that goes perfect with the pastries they offer. the space is small with only a few tables to sit at so i would suggest getting your stuff to go. \u000a\u000atheir sandwiches are also delicious. the fresh french baguette really makes the sandwich. the le parisien (french baguette with butter, ham, and swiss cheese) was my favorite.\u000a\u000athe people seem happy working there, are patient while waiting for you to make your choices and greet you with a smile. \u000a\u000aif you are ever in the area, this place is a must stop!

Veasily my favorite coffeehouse in sqhill.  their coffees are reasonably priced and high quality.  i used to be a big fan of another sqhill coffee institution (that shall remain nameless).  one morning i had to go to said place in stead of commonplace, and, no lie, i almost spit out my coffee it tasted so bad in comparison.

Vthis is my new favorite coffee shop in pittsburgh! they roast their own coffee (at a different location), and the baristas seem to be very knowledgeable and friendly. the shop itself is clean and has an inviting atmosphere, and they even take square as a payment service (on your iphone) which is extremely convenient. the best soy cappuccino i've ever had came from this location.

Vwell we certainly have a plethora of coffeehouses here in squirrel hill and i'm' surprised i haven't reviewed this one yet.  commonplace took over from the old arefa's espresso a few years ago.  \u000a\u000athe place seems inviting enough, though not as comfortable as the nearby 61c.  but they really are trying to build a community atmosphere here.   .i tried the building new hope nicaraguan el porveir and found it to be a really smooth blend.

Vthe trib total media amphitheatre at station square has been around in one form or another for the past 25 years.  i remember when i was a teen it was called the ic light amphitheatre and it was a temporary looking stage.  next to it was the tent which was booked for smaller acts.  it's been in several locations in station square including the west lot, the east lot, etc.  it's also been known at various times as the amphitheatre at station square, the melody amphitheatre, and the chevrolet amphitheatre.  it didn't operate between 2006 and 2009.\u000a\u000ait's a nice little facility to see a show.  the sightlines are way better than at first niagara pavilion.  let's face it, the whole atmosphere is w-a-y better here.  plus you don't have to drive all the way out to the boonies and you can eat and drink at station square before or after the show.  so you don't get gouged on parking or food and beverages.  the only thing i don't like is that because it's booked by live nation, it tends to get a lot of has beens---er i mean "classic rock acts from the 70s" (chicago, reo, doobie brothers).  every so often they get a good act though and i took my dad here last night as an early father's day gift.  we were sitting in section 117--granted a little towards the back but not too bad.  \u000a\u000aso faithful music fans....can you combine a concert with "wheel of fortune"?  well if you're declan mcmanus (you know him as elvis costello) you sure can.  stage right he had the spectacular spinning songbook, a roulette wheel, which was spun by various audience members, nearly all of them female (quel suprise) and not one of them me (of course not).  this concept really didn't work too well at first and costello and the imposters seemed to be a little shaky on that.  \u000a\u000ano matter, the rest of it was fantastic.  he opened up with "i hope you're happy now" and then did such tunes as "mystery dance", "radio radio", "(i don't want to go to) chelsea", etc.  the "spin" songs included "you tripped up at every step", "everyday i write the book", "sulky girl" & "monkey to man".  after a brief intermission, he did a lovely slow version of "allison", which included a medley of "tracks of my tears" & "tears of a clown".  he also did "watching the detectives" and my personal favorite "what's so funny about peace, love & understanding."\u000a\u000aelvis costello is a very engaging performer and he's one of a few that have remained viable as he ages, not just content to sing the same old classics over and over.  dad was into his early music and he remembers the time on snl when costello began playing "less than zero" then actually stopped the show before going into "radio radio".  me, i got into his music when i was a teen and "veronica" became a huge hit.  so he transcends generations.\u000a\u000aand now i can safely say i've seen elvis.

Vso i'm with darren w. on the united steelworkers union.  my grandfathers were both mill workers.  it was thanks to the union that my grandfathers enjoyed such "ridiculous" (as edwin h puts it) as 40 hour work weeks, paid overtime, affordable healthcare, good wages and pay increases, and above all a decent pension.  my grandfathers were able to buy homes without fear of foreclosure.  they were able to buy cars, put food on the table, and raise my parents.  they were able to retire on decent, but not lavish pensions.\u000a\u000aridiculous, ain't it?\u000a\u000asome may believe the cliche of unions encouraging laziness, but i can assure you that my grandfathers worked damn hard in those mills.  they could certainly put the yuppie whiners of today to shame with their work ethics (or in the yuppie's case, a lack thereof)   unions were and are a system of checks and balances.  unions ensure that management cannot trample all over the workers.  since most union jobs have been abolished, you have to ask yourself where have wages gone since then?  where have your benefits gone?  why have the poor increased many fold in number?  why are smaller percentages of people owning greater percentages of wealth?  why has the gulf between rich and poor widened?  why are pensions the thing of the past?  why must we accept poverty wages as the norm?

Vit's a strong start.\u000a\u000asaw a writeup for this place online, and stopped in last week for lunch.  the special was a rice, shrimp, and red sauce dish that was okay, but we also had the namesake - pastitisio - which was excellent.  \u000a\u000atried the lemonade, which was cheap *and* actually made with lemons, delicious.  took home a pound of dolmades - vegetarian grape leaves.  the dolmades were a touch dry, but didn't last the day anyways.\u000a\u000ai'm interested in heading back in a month or so, seeing how the place progresses as they're open longer.

Vspoon just proves that east liberty is neighborhood in the midst of revitalization. spoon itself is split into a restaurant and a lounge area. currently, the lounge area offers an intimate bar setting and a limited appetizer menu (although there are burgers s-w). the restaurant has a full menu, and includes a wide variety of items sourced from local growers.\u000a\u000amy friends and i uniformly thought that the food was fantastic, and the presentation was good. i took a look at the wine list, as well, and the selection is decent, although not outstanding, but more importantly, the prices are reasonable.\u000a\u000awe had no problem getting a table on a weeknight, and i would recommend this as a good place to take a date or get an after-work drink.

Vi'm so glad that pittsburgh has added yet another great dining experience to the mix.  everything is sourced as locally and sustainably as they can manage, which is always a good thing, in my book.  the food was great, but it did take a little bit for it to come out.  the servers were incredibly apologetic about the timing - i think it's just one of those things they have to work out.  we started with a tuna tartare appetizer, which was great.  we then shared the pork entree, which was also really delicious.  portion sizes were just right, not too much, and not too small.\u000a\u000athe vodka gimlet, btw, is definitely worth trying.  very tasty!\u000a\u000athe decor doesn't look substantially different from what it did when it was red room, but the food is substantially better!  and isn't that what counts?  although ... i do have one request - could they please bring back the croissant chocolate bread pudding they used to make at red room as a dessert?  pretty please?

Vmy husband took me here for our first anniversary and everything was perfect.  they have a great wine selection, amazing food and even better desserts.\u000a\u000ahe ordered the chicken two ways, and i had a salmon caesar salad.  the food was cooked perfectly and the presentation was artful.\u000a\u000aalthough the meal was great, i think my favorite thing about spoon is the atmosphere--very modern, neutral color palette, lots of candles lit.  we will definitely return--it's a great place to sit and share a bottle of wine.

Vthe experience from start to finish was delightful. we drove around the block 3 times before opting for the valet service which is extremely reasonable at $3.upon entering the restaurant, the maitre d' took our coats and we were promptly seated. the decor is very soft, soothing, and intimate. service was exceptional, not at all overbearing.\u000a\u000a as for the food, jb and i started off by splitting (they actually split it on seperate plates) the gorgonzola blue cheese souffl which came with a bed of arugula, roasted beets, grapefruit, and fennel. i expected a slightly pungent flavor but it was perfectly balanced and so light & fluffy. for dinner i had the vegetarian sampler which was divine. the cannolli was situated on top of a roasteed red pepper puree that lent some acidity to the mushroom and cheese filling. the brie bruscetta was good, but i would have liked more brie. oooo and the truffels, well, they make everything better.  jb had the strip steak which was so tender, it just fell apart and "the fat (which there was very little of) just melted in his mouth" (i'll take his word on that one). the accompanyments to his steak were just as pleasing.  \u000a\u000aour cocktails were both boozey but very good and we were so full from the dinner that we couldn't even attempt dessert. maybe next time...and there will be a next time!\u000a\u000aif i could knock off half a star i would. only because of the valet, they park your car for you but its up to you to find it afterwards. at $3 though, its hard to complain

Vi'd actually give spoon 3.5 now that i've thought about my experience. i kind of jumped the gun when i gave 5 stars, im taking half a star off for valet, half a star off for not getting these legendary biscuits (a friend of mine went a week later and had to inquire about them after seeing other tables receive them) and the last half star comes off because i could have made the cannoli and bruschetta at home.

Vi've made several trips to spoon, and the food seems to get better and better.  there's the imaginative menu for one thing, then the careful preparation, followed by excellent service.  i particularly like the smiles i get from the wait staff, there are many restaurants that feature bored or snobby staff, i always feel like a special guest at spoon.  i also recommend the wine tasting on first and third thursdays from 7 pm - 9 pm.  it's called "3 blind wines," and it's a blind wine tasting that's lots of fun.

Vgreat find in the middle of nowhere banksville road.  i'd just about given up on indian food in the burgh (except for taj majal up on mcknight road... but who is going to drive there on a regular basis?) and my friend pulled me back in.  this place has all three of my trinity of cream based chickeny goodness favorites - chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and butter chicken.  in a pinch, i always get one of these three.  this time, i got the chicken korma and the lamb saag.  \u000a\u000aboth were delicious, and spice-y in a way that i hadn't had before (i.e., not spicy as in hot, but spicy as in lots of interesting spices).  we contemplated one of the many naan choices, but ultimately decided to skip the carbs.  in retrospect, i wish we had gotten some, because the sauces here were great.\u000a\u000ai also got a mango lassi, which was spiked with cardamon, which i wasn't used to, but still tasty.  just a heads up.\u000a\u000ain sum, a good find that i will go to again should i ever find myself up over thataway.

Vwhen you first walk in, the atmosphere is surprisingly luxe.  considering i was coming in from a strip mall parking lot, i was surprised when i saw the jewel-toned walls and white tablecloths.  pleasantly surprised!\u000a\u000athe menu is so big it's a little overwhelming.  they have it split up into indo-manchurian, south indian, and a few other categories like veggie, lamb, chicken, etc.\u000a\u000ai came with two other people and we ordered samosas, two kinds of naan (rosemary and regular), chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and an eggplant curry dish.\u000a\u000athe naan and samosas were delicious.  the guys loved their chicken dishes, but my eggplant entree was a little short on eggplant and was pretty much a bowl full of sauce.  hot, delicious curry sauce--so i still ate most of it anyway, just scooping it up with the naan. \u000a\u000awe also shared a bottle of wine.  it's byob with no corkage fee, so that's a definite plus.  the minus is that they are slooooooooooow with water.  come on, people!  i ordered an "8" on the spice scale!\u000a\u000athey were also painfully slow in bringing the check.  like, so slow that we were about to walk up to the counter to pay because we thought that was the way to be able to leave.  we got to the restaurant at 7:15, were done eating in an hour, and didn't leave until after 9.  what?!  it's kind of a laissez-faire waiting style, similar to what you'd expect in a french cafe.  not what i'd expect from a full-service restaurant in pittsburgh though.\u000a\u000abottom line--atmosphere: great, food: good, service: the worst.  give it a try if you're not in a hurry.

Vi was anxious to try this new addition to the shadyside buisness district, however i was quite disappointed.  i think their prices are too high, and they gave me a lot of hassles on a return.  i expected a lot better customer service, but they gave me the run-around.  they sent me to their online store to make the exchange, but then the online store said they would not send an exchange for pickup in the store.  my best advice is to shop elsewhere.

V"if you have to wake up, you really should start your day with a sweet treat from prantl's."  so says their website.  well actually i believe that if you have to wake up, you should do so with coffee, coffee, and more coffee.  remember folks, a caffienated susan is a happy susan!  and because i'll soon be the boss, my minions will discover that when susan is happy, they'll be happy!  but i digress...\u000a\u000abut i get it, yeah.  hey, who wouldn't want to start the day with a lovely sweet?  ever since jenny lee shut down, prantl's has filled in the void on market square.  it's too bad this place is a bit of a hike from work.  or maybe that's a good thing.  i'd get so fat and i'd burn up so much insulin from all the sweet gooey pecan rolls, strudels, donuts, pies, and tarts here.  and just look at the varieties of coffee cakes http://www.prantlsbakery.com/our-products/coffeecakes/\u000a\u000ai'd say i love the cookies the best, with the rum tea being my favorite.  forget dunkin!  stop in here for a yummy donut!  \u000a\u000aokay everybody!  one more time:  "pump that insulin, susan!  pump!"

Vso the space really is nice, but the staff are truly horrible.  it's required to actually physically hand your keytag over to a staff member before entering, which wouldn't really be a problem, except almost all the staff are more interested in:\u000a\u000a--txting\u000a--watching tv on the big screens in the gym\u000a--just standing around\u000a--hitting on any attractive female that walks in the door \u000a\u000athan in taking your keytag.  there have been multiple days when i would get skipped over in the line formed up to hand over the keytag for every person more attractive than me, or just stand around waiting while the staff member was hitting on someone.  another classic "urban active" moment was when i was waiting in line at the juice bar for 5 minutes after a workout waiting for a smoothie, while a meathead staff member leaned against the wall with his back to me texting.  his manager came out and said meathead would be right with me.  meathead turned around, looked at me, laughed at me, and went back to texting.  i did not receive a smoothie.  \u000a\u000athe attitude of every person that works there is definitely "lol you signed a contract screw you."  it's way too expensive to put up with that bullshit.

Vvery good gym. it's big and you don't have to wait very long to use the equipment.  some of the provisions of the contract are unreasonable, so be careful what you sign, you may have to pay for early termination, late fees, and other nonsense.  but i like that everything is clean and there are lots of ways to exercise.

Vsome friends and i were looking for a place downtown with food specials for happy hour, and element's tasting tuesdays and usual happy hour specials($5 pizzas, drinks from $3-$5) seemed right up our alley. we arrived at happy hour and they directed us to the loung area: about half the restaurant with low tables that seated 4, high tables which could probably seat 6, and a long curved bar. half the tables(the ones by the window) were reserved, but were never taken for the duration of our visit.\u000a\u000awe arrived at about 3 minutes to 5 and asked the waitress about happy hour: "you have to wait until 5, it's not me, it's the computer!" - save it, i've heard it all before. you might have an argument after 5 because i don't know your system, but that close to 5, take my order and take a nap for 2 minutes before you put it in. see, computer's not all that smart.\u000a\u000aregardless, the specials for the restaurant were very good. the menu said select drafts were $3, but in reality all of them were. a decent selection of beers that contained a few macros and a few craft domestics. i settled for a great lakes burning river and a troeg's dead reckoner. my friend got a mini martini flight for $5 - 3 1.5-2oz martinis of the chef's choosing. today he was feeling apple, so she got an apple burbon martni, a granny smith martini, and an apple cosmo. my friends seemed to agree that the apple burbon was easily the favorite, but enjoyed them all.\u000a\u000ait came time to order some food, and while i originally planned on getting a pizza, the soup($9) beckoned: a butternut squash soup with green onions, chili oil, and crab meat. my friends chose a meatball and a proscuttio pizza. the food arrived and the soup had an interesting presentation: an empty bowl with the chili oil, crab meat, and green onions was placed down, then the soup was poured over it from a large looking tea-kettle. we all agreed our food was tasty, the crab meat and chili oil being highlights in the dish to the point that i feel like they could put a little bit more in, because each bite without seemed lacking. the pizzas were "good, but definitely no piccolo forno". my friends were still hungry at the end and ordered a pumpkin tasting dessert($8). it was a sizeable plate containing brittle, a cheesecake lollipop, a truffle, a panna cotta, and what seemed to donut holes, but i didn't catch the description. they agreed this was probably the highlight of their meal.\u000a\u000athe down side of the restaurant was the service. any questions we had were met with short, uncomfortable responses. we asked them about the prominently displayed "tasting tuesday" signs in the window, she simply said "that's for downtown residents" until a few seconds of silence and dumbfounded looks on our faces caused her to go into slightly more detail. met with a question about validating parking, again a short response, as if it were even busy enough that we could possibly be holding her from something. regardless, the service was fast and efficient, and she was not rude by any stretch: it just felt that we might have been seen as inferior customers by coming in for the happy hour.\u000a\u000aregardless, elements was certainly a decent stop on our quest to sample downtown happy hours. the drink specials are great(they also do $5 sangria and select wines) and the pizzas make for a good bar snack, if the food in the bar didn't quite live up to what i feel the restaurant is pushing with its image. i would happily stop back in.

Vwhen rick and i come down to the strip district we sometimes stop at strip district meats.  depends on what we're in the mood for.  it definitely has that old world strip district feel to it.  believe it or not their head butcher once studied art and sculpture at cmu which gave him an idea of how to arrange everything so the customer can get a vision of a wonderful meal.\u000a\u000athey can do holiday orders here.  and all their meats can be prepared to order. if you need suggestions, their staff can help you.  we mainly get our meat here when we're planning a special meal.  we love the smoked meats here and the sausages (except italian--we get that at donatelli's).

Vwell i finally made it out to consol energy center.  i've got to admit i had some trepidation.  see, i've always loved the old civic arena.  i know, it was getting old and a little run down.  but it was distinct and i always had a place in my heart for the old igloo.  rick and i had tickets for tonight's penguins game, but not the penguins you're thinking of.  their ahl affiliate, the wilkes-barre penguins were playing the washington capital's affiliate, the hershey bears.  we'd only been to one other ahl game before and that was a chicago wolves game a few years ago.\u000a\u000aso how does the consol energy center stack up?  well, nothing will ever replace the civic arena but judging it on its own merits, it's fantastic.  besides being brand spankin' new, the seats here are very comfortable and the sightlines here are outstanding.  we had main floor seats--we'd never be able to afford those for an nhl game--and we could see everything quite well.  they drew a respectable 13,000 for the game too.

Vi have been to several pens games here and i find the venue to be very good.  i seek out the sweet potato fries, they are hard to find but worth the trouble (sections 120 & 232.  the burgatory concession is also good, section 206.  the visibility is great from everywhere in the room.

Vlooking back, if anyone ever told me back in 1991 or 1992 i'd be seeing bruce springsteen & the e street band in the year 2012, i'd'a said that person was nuts.  see back then springsteen had disbanded the e street band.  and his major albums at the time--"tunnel of love", "lucky town", and "human touch" kind of represented him in an artistic nadir.  they are not favorites of springsteen fans.  and the song "streets of philadelphia"?  as far as i'm concerned, the lyrics are beautiful however musically i think the song is very dull.  it doesn't go anywhere.\u000a\u000aface it folks.  springsteen was someone my dad liked.  geezer rock.  passe.\u000a\u000abut then a few things happened.  i grew up.  i began to diversify my musical tastes.  thanks to a certain billy bragg and wilco album called "mermaid avenue", i began to hear how bruce springsteen was inspired (if maybe indirectly) by woody guthrie.  then he put the e street band back together and began writing politically charged material again.  and scored a major comeback.\u000a\u000athe funny thing is i've seen bruce springsteen live in concert before.  twice in fact.  but i'd seen him as a sideman with  joe grushecky & the houserockers at their now legendary shows at soldiers and sailors memorial hall.  \u000a\u000abut this time around it was bruce, not joe.  and along with the e street band, he gave a thundering show, running through the catalogue.  he began with "don't look back" and worked his way through about five songs including "hungry heart" before getting to "we take care of our own", the first single off of his latest album, "wrecking ball".  and no fans, the new material is not an excuse to take a washroom break or run for the beer stands.  this new material is very good and "we take care of our own" is a highly politically-charged song.  let's hope no one co-opts it, misinterprets it, or abuses it like "born in the usa" was.  \u000a\u000athe band worked through a few more issues-related songs including "death to my hometown" and "my city in ruins".  we then heard some of the more classic springsteen hits including "spirit in the night", "adam raised a cain" and "because the night" (sorry patti smith and natalie merchant, but he totally reclaimed that tune).\u000a\u000awell he finished the main set with "land of hopes and dreams".  the encore began with "racing in the street" and "born to run".  and who joined him on stage for "glory days"?  yep, you guessed it--joe grushecky and his son johnny grushecky.  but bruce did step into the background for one grushecky number--"light of day".  so yes, i've now seen three springsteen/grushecky performances.\u000a\u000awhat i did miss though was the 45 minute free concert springsteen gave in support of barack obama at soldiers & sailors earlier that afternoon.  \u000a\u000aand my one regret of the whole evening was that i never got the chance to see and hear clarence clemmons live.  having him still around would have made the evening complete.

Vthis is a very short review.\u000a\u000athis place served me the best meal i've had in years, and i'm enormously happy it's open; it's spendy, but damn, if you're going out for a good dinner, this is the place i'd recommend, hands down.\u000a\u000aphenomenal.  perfect.  no fault.  awesome.  great.  stellar.  wooo.

Voh. my god. drop every single thing you're doing right now and go to salt of the earth. go ahead, i'll wait. go eat there, then come back and give this review a big ol' "useful" (i also accept gifts) for leading you to the best restaurant in pittsburgh. \u000a\u000athe surroundings are modern and warm, and the waitstaff is friendly, professional and knowledgable. the food is conscientious, complex, delicious, quality, and surprisingly reasonably priced. when i went, none of the entrees were more than $25, and the portions are perfect.  i was really afraid this was going to be a fancy $40, 2oz fillet with celery foam pretentious place, and it was the total opposite. the menu is written on a giant chalk board, and you can also download it to your phone if you want to read it in hand. there's a set of specialty cocktails, wines by the glass and bottle and beer for libations. the appetizers are big enough to share, and are all around $10. get the cockscombs. yep, that weird thing on the top of a chicken's head. get it. eat it. love it. get dessert too. goat cheese ice cream with raw honey, crushed pistachios, and lavendar-infused white chocolate-- how you gonna say no?? finally, they have the chemical symbol for salt on their exterior. nerds rejoice!

Vthere's a good reason why salt of the earth won "best new restaurant" in pittsburgh magazine.  and why it's packed with patrons.  it's simply the best pittsburgh has to offer and it delivers a great meal for a very reasonable price.  the wine list is excellent.  every dish is extremely creative and carefully prepared.  the kitchen is open for viewing and the seating downstairs is communal tables.  while you may not agree with the way they do things at salt, they certainly do it well.  i highly recommend this place.

Vanother visit to salt of the earth and i was not disappointed.  i got the montepulciano d'abruzzo, which is a very yummy wine that goes well with many of the dishes here.  the risotto/miso/octopus/prosciutto/cantalope appetizer was delicious.  the octopus was cooked to perfection, not an easy thing to do.  the miso adds a lot of flavor and texture.  very rich and satisfying overall.  we were able to share this appetizer, and because of the intense flavors, there was enough to go around for 2 people.  i had the  scallops/chorizo/saffron/rapini/anchovy/kalamata and i loved the spanish/moroccan treatment of this dish.  there was a lot of spice and flavor to the food, but not too much heat.  scallops cooked to perfection with a wonderful texture.  there were heirloom tomatoes grown in a garfield farm, which was a nice touch.  my friend had the flank steak/garbanzo/asparagus/chimichurri and it was also very good. the asparagus was cooked just right, the chimichurri was excellent.  i can see why this dish is often on the menu at salt.\u000a\u000ahere's the thing about salt.  the food is meant to challenge you.  you can spend some time figuring out how they put everything together and what the chef was trying to accomplish.  some might call this fussy, but i call it creative, intense, wonderful and satisfying.  there's always something to discuss and enjoy about the food.  if you are looking for simple elegance, then salt may not be for you.  but if you enjoy complexity and creativity, you will probably want to return to salt of the earth again and again.\u000a\u000ai always recommend sitting at the common tables.  i heard the beautiful white wood was salvaged from local riverview park and i love the beauty of the wood and the craftmanship.  you are sitting quite close to the person across from you, and i think that promotes conversation.  \u000a\u000athe menu is on the wall, and it changes frequently and especially seasonally.  there used to be a good number of stan the wine man's wines, but i am not sure what happened to them...hope to see them at salt again soon.\u000a\u000athe kitchen is open and viewable, which creates some drama and completes the whole farm to table cycle.  it's local food prepared locally...and you see it prepared before your eyes.\u000a\u000amy vote for best restaurant in pittsburgh.

Vsalt is one of those places jb and i have been meaning to try but just never got around to...until now.  \u000a\u000awe started off sharing the watermelon soup and tomato starter. the soup was perfect for a hot summer day, chilled to just the right temp with a kick of jalapeno for a little bit of heat and fresh herbs with every delicious bite. the tomato dish was beautifully presented, two large midsection slices in the center of the plate with herbs and micro shaved parmesan. heirloom cherry tomatoes lined the edge of the plate with dots of dashi gel artistically scattered about.\u000a\u000afor entrees, i ordered the tofu and j the ribeye. my tofu dish was a work of art, carrot puree on the bottom with a sarsaparilla reduction. on its own, the reduction was overpoweringly sweet but mixing it with the puree achieved a succulent balance. the bright orange of the puree and vibrant green of the peas and asparagus provided a pop of color to the toothsome, smoky tofu. toothsome meaning extra firm but still chewy, just the way i like it. jb's sous vide ribeye was medium rare, the fat was like butter and you could literally pull the meat apart with a fork. three different types of mushrooms and baby zucchini accompanied the steak and were packed with flavor! i found myself stealing veggies off of the plate time and time again.\u000a\u000awe did not partake in dessert but jb did imbibe on some cocktails while i did not. the first was vodka with some chartreuse, the second he left up to our waiter and what tim returned with was a jasmine tea, pink lemonade concoction that was amazing!! tart and refreshing, boozy but not overpoweringly so. needless to say, he had another.\u000a\u000abottom line is, this was a meal worth waiting for but we won't be waiting long to return.

Vi've only ever gotten take out from here while at work.  it serves the purpose of filling the belly until you can make it home to run to the toilet.\u000a\u000aordering over the phone from here can be an experience...that is if anyone picks up the phone.  better yet, they pick up and immediately put you on hold without even asking.\u000a\u000ai've had the joy of experiencing a little bit of this and that from there.  usually go for the combination platter.  just your usual fare that comes with your choice of white or fried rice and an egg roll.\u000a\u000adepending on their promotion if you call in an order over a certain amount, they usually give you something in your order.  recently it's been a two liter soda; in the past it has been an appetizer portion of fried won tons and 20 oz. sodas.\u000a\u000aword of advice, if you don't have your own utensils at work or wherever you are ordering from, ask for chopsticks, they are more sturdy then the thin plastic fork they'll give you.

Vwhat a hidden gem. this is old school pittsburgh at its best. if you like the whole dark wood, library aesthetic, this is the place for you. add to that, an awesome waiter and great food, what's not to like?\u000a\u000amy husband and i came here for lunch one day, and both got the daily special, which was squash ravioli in cream sauce (it was actually called something much fancier), and we both also had portobello mushroom on top. it was absolutely delicious, and we couldn't figure out why the ravioli filling was so damn good. turns out that if you add just a touch of blue cheese to squash puree, the result is magic. who knew?\u000a\u000awe will definitely be coming back here for lunch when we're downtown.

Vwe are razzy fresh devotees, but when i saw a groupon for tutti frutti one day, we decided to check it out and give it a chance.  let's just say we were not converted.\u000a\u000athe decor is very cute - shiny, clean, and colorful.  they have many choices of flavor, and i tasted a few.  i wasn't overwhelmed by the mango or original flavors, but the vanilla was pretty good and very similar to the razz.  they also had a great topping selection for the most part, some creative offerings, lots of random kids cereals, and a fair amount of fruit - but no mango!  i was super bummed about that.  the juicy mango bits are my favorite thing to put in froyo!  sad.  my boyfriend was more unsatisfied than me - taro is his favorite flavor at the razz, and he did not like tutti frutti's taro at all.  i tasted it and it was hard for me to judge, since i don't like taro anyway, but tf's yogurt was generally less strongly flavored, and had a bit more "fake" sweetness to it.\u000a\u000awe gave it a chance, but i don't think we'll be back.  why to go tutti frutti when, for the same price, you can get some tastier froyo (and mango chunks!) at razzy fresh?  razzy fresh is also about a block closer to our apartment, so the deal is sealed.  razzy fresh wins the froyo throwdown!

Vi ate here recently and was very impressed.\u000a\u000apros: excellent, excellent burgers. creative toppings, well-cooked meat, and great buns (often overlooked). additionally, the burgers are inexpensive given the quality. the fries and particularly the brgr sauce are fantastic, as well. finally, the alcoholic shakes are amazing.\u000a\u000acons: beer prices are high. i guess this is where they count on making their money. also, service was slow when i went on a weeknight, so i imagine it's even worse on a weekend.

Vi would give brgr 2.5 stars if i could but certainly not 3 so ill stick with the 2. \u000a\u000ajb and i went around 5:30ish on a saturday evening and got seated right away. tables are pretty tightly squeezed together and they have those 1 sided communal booth thingys with chairs on the other side, which i hate. the party to my left was obnoxious and so loud  i could hear every word of their conversation, therefore i had to yell across the table to be heard.  the couches are a fun idea and looked comfy, maybe a little too comfy - people were actually laying on them.\u000a\u000aanyway, on to the food. well, before we could order food we had to have a waitress. service was lackluster, but to be fair it was pretty crowded. i got a ginger beer to quench my thirst but to my dismay, the waitress poured it over a glass filled to the brim with ice which quickly watered down my beverage and diluted that amazing ginger bite. for dinner i ordered a treehugger, the lentil &  falafel patty was crunchy and dry, i had to slather it in the house mustard to get it down. jb had the locavoire, a lamb patty with mint and feta and a plethora of other ingredients all vying for attention. it was over ambitious to say the least. we ordered fries and fried pickles as sides. the fried pickles were the best i've ever eaten but you only got 3 spears - that's not even a whole pickle!!! the fries were of the shoestring variety with parmesan cheese on top (or should i say on bottom because that's where most of the shreds were found). the flavor was good but they could have stayed in the fryer a bit longer.\u000a\u000ai was really excited about finally getting to grub at brgr, unfortunately, the experience was a huge let down.

Vthe burgers are outstanding but, the customer service could be better. \u000a\u000amy wife, daughter and i decided to give this place a try. i must say i really dig the decor. it is very manly with lots of tvs on the walls, nice shades of blue and grey. two huge all glass garage doors that open to let the warm weather in. there is a decent size bar area also, there is even a outdoor level on the second floor. \u000a\u000awe were seated promptly and handed menus. we order our drinks. my wife and i got cokes and our daughter got a chocolate milk. when our drinks came my daughter tasted her milk and said it tasted funny. my wife smelled and tasted it. it was spoiled! i'm glad i didn't get a milkshake if they are using spoiled milk! we flagged down the waitress and told her that our daughter's milk was spoiled. she apologized and said she tasted it before she brought it out. you tasted my daughter's chocolate milk?! are you going to taste our burgers too? i knew she was full of it because if she did taste it she would have know it was spoiled! she replaced it with a coke and all was well. \u000a\u000awe already knew what we wanted as we looked at the menu already online but, the burgers we wanted weren't on the menu. maybe they change ever so often. \u000a\u000athey do offer kids meals. don't ask me why they are not listed on the menu. for kids meals they offer a cheeseburger, grill cheese or hot dog which includes fries and a drink. my daughter got the cheeseburger and loved it. i believe the kids burger is the same size as a adult burger as she could only finish half of it. \u000a\u000amy wife got the "cease & desist" which consists of a burger with american cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 island dressing. pretty much their version of a big mac. i had the "button buster" which consists of a burger topped with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar cheese, barnaise aioli and crispy onion rings. it was outstanding! i especially liked the bun as it was coated with butter and then lightly toasted. \u000a\u000amy wife and i shared a order of brgr fries tossed with parmesan and herbs and topped with cheese whiz. they were really good as well. \u000a\u000aour waitress came over with drink refills without being asked i might add (which always gets you a few extra bucks in your tip from me), as we were eating to tell us that her shift was over at brgr and she was going over next door to spoon to start her shift there. and that we would be taken care of by her replacement. we sat waiting for a good ten to fifteen minutes for our check and a doggy bag. my wife flagged down a waitress would then got our replacement waitress to bring our check. \u000a\u000aother then our daughter's spoiled milk and taking forever to get our check we really liked brgr and would have given it 5 stars. we will defiantly be back!

Vsome coworkers and i came here for lunch last week, to order "a burger, hold the vowels."  we were seated right away around noon on a weekday, but there was a pretty decent sized lunch crowd.  the door/window thing was open so we got a nice breeze - it can make it chilly if it isn't a warm day outside, so bring a sweater!\u000a\u000aour server was friendly, and was nice about waiting to take our order until our last friend came about 10 minutes later.  we desperately wanted alcoholic milkshakes, but stuck with water since we were on the clock - pity.  so we decided to split some side dishes, which came out first as appetizers.  we got the "brgr fries with truffle cheese whiz," and the "housemade chips with crack dip."  yes, crack dip.  apparently it does not contain real crack, so don't be afraid.\u000a\u000athe sides were okay - i love french fries in all situations, but the "truffle cheese whiz" didn't add much to it.  i'm not really a big fan of processed cheese food, even if "truffles" are involved. i prefer plain old ketchup.  fries were totally decent, with a little smattering of herbs and parmesan on top.  the potato chips were tasty and freshly fried, but the crack dip was essentially more cheese whiz, only this time they added sriracha instead of "truffle."  it tasted pretty much the same to me as the truffle cheese whiz, and its neon-orange nacho cheese appearance was not really appealing.  so i say if you're getting sides, avoid anything with cheese.  sides can easily be shared between several people - the four of us couldn't finish the chips and fries between us.\u000a\u000ai'm being weird and healthy lately, so i decided not to get a regular beef burger.  i asked the server which was the best of the non-beef burgers, and he suggested the asian-flavored tuna burger, aka the "love you long time."  really?  can't say if i was asian i'd be a huge fan of that title (imagine ordering matzo ball soup and it being called "big nose take all your money" soup).  anywaaaay, you can order it seared rare or cooked through - get it rare, tuna cooked all the way through is not yummy.  there's some avocado in there, also wasabi, sweet soy, pickled cucumber and daikon, and "chili aioli" which was a pretty creamy, somewhat spicy sauce.\u000a\u000ait was all pretty good, had lots of flavor, but it was a bit heavy.  i guess i'd hoped for more sushi-on-a-bun, but the creamy sauce and somewhat messy toppings made the meal seem a bit rich.  still, i ate most if it before i got full. didn't think it was worth taking home.\u000a\u000athe restaurant itself is nicely decorated and sunny.  i'd like to come back this summer for a boozy milkshake and a beef burger.  oh, it's a wee bit pricey as well, i think the prices are better suited for dinner, so keep that in mind.  and watch out for the rcst brgrs.

Veh. maybe i was expecting too much? overall, this place was a letdown, though closer to 2.5 than 2. let's review, shall we?\u000a\u000apros: \u000a1. they text you when your table is ready. i like not having to stick within 10 feet of the host, especially in a crowded space like brgr.\u000a2. spiked milkshakes. seriously, this was pretty much the only redeeming factor. these things are the bomb-diggity. salted caramel and the dude (think white russian) are to die for. prepare for multiple brain freezes.\u000a3. they can cook meat to the requested temperature. sadly, this can be a rare quality, and brgr nailed a med rare, med, and a med well.\u000a4. the fries were good, and the truffle cheese whiz was ok.\u000a\u000acons:\u000a1. our server sucked. i won't go into the details, but she was a space cadet.\u000a2. the fried pickles are spears, and they're nothing to write home about. especially since they're, like, $1/spear.\u000a3. my kobe burger was just ok. honestly, i took 2 bites, and was done.  i didn't get onions on mine since another burger at the table requested no onions, and there was barely any bleu cheese. the whole thing was dry.\u000a4. it's expensive.\u000a\u000ai'll try you again, brgr, and hopefully we can go up a star or two next visit.

Vi must have been at a different place than all the other reviewers.  i had a very pleasant experience while i was here for the first time.\u000a\u000athe wait staff was very polite and chatty as can be.  attentive to our needs and always coming back around to refill our drinks.  the food was delicious.  i opted for the california lovin', i was craving and in need of a turkey burger and it hit the spot.  the pesto mayo and alfalfa sprouts was quite the nice mixture.  on a wheat bun was a great choice as well.\u000a\u000amy only downside here is that i was unaware that a burger only came with a pickle as a side.  i was kind of expecting to receive chips or fries as a side, but just a plain old dill pickle.  next time i'll be sure to add a side or get an appetizer to start.

Vpretty standard but nonetheless awesome frozen yogurt.\u000asteer clear of the tart flavors.. i prefer sticking to the more ice cream-y ones like cake batter and new york cheesecake.\u000agood selection of toppings and a really spacious area to sit and hang out with friends in.. best ambiance out of all the neighboring joints on craig st.

Vthis place is awful.  it's always totally empty, and for good reason.  i went for lunch today since it's walking distance from my workplace, but i will never go back.\u000a\u000ai got yelled at for asking questions about the menu, it took forever to get my food, the food wasn't that good--and then it made me feel sick all afternoon.  i got the lunch special with vegetables and tofu, steamed rice, and hot and sour soup.  it was all bland--amazing, since this restaurant is one of the few chinese places that still uses msg.\u000a\u000ait looks like they used to do a buffet, but now the food tubs on the buffets are filled with old magazines and trash.  not even kidding...i don't usually write entirely bad reviews, but i can't think of a single good thing about yen's.\u000a\u000aif it were the zombie apocalypse and i were locked in this restaurant, i still wouldn't eat the food.  gross.

Vi am quite a fan of the public market.  it's filled with booths from a variety of small local businesses.  it doesn't replace what's in the strip, it just adds to what you can find.  \u000a\u000asometimes i forget that the apple guy is only there on saturdays.  while that's disappointing, i completely understand.  he's a full time farmer.  it's one of my favorite things to buy, i think he has the best apples in pittsburgh.

Vwhen my coworkers told me that coriander had finally opened, i knew what my boyfriend and i were having for dinner!  we came in on a friday night, about a week after they had opened.  we were seated immediately, even though the place was really very crowded!  clearly, everyone is jazzed about an indian restaurant in squirrel hill.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is pleasant, with dim lighting and lots of booths - it feels more like a true restaurant than many of the other places on murray.  however, there are a few tvs playing bollywood music videos, and the volume was turned up a bit high.  it was a little distracting - our eyes kept going up to the screen, sometimes in the middle of conversation!\u000a\u000abeginning with the food - we started with mango lassis, which i really enjoyed.  they were creamy but not too thick - some places make them practically like smoothies - and they weren't too sweet either.  we had an order of regular naan, which was hot and as tasty as expected.  we also shared three dishes - it was way too much food for the two of us, but we knew that in advanced and took some home.\u000a\u000awe had a lamb dish that was one of their specials, and the name of tihe dish started with x.  i can't remember the name but hey, it starts with x, you can't miss it.  the dish had long red chiles and curry leaves clearly visible, and you could taste the complexity of the spice blend.  the chicken biryani was very good, though i had trouble appreciating its flavor after the strongly flavored lamb.  i didn't care as much for our vegetarian offering - paneer in some sort of red tomato-looking sauce.  i prefer creamier, richer indian dishes and this one was a bit more thin and had a stronger acidic flavor than i prefer.  all in all though, the food was solid, and the menu was pretty extensive with some creative offerings.\u000a\u000aservice, as can be expected from a brand new restaurant, was slow and disoriented.  we waited a long time for a server to take our order, a long time for our drinks, and a long time for our food.  i'm sure they are just working the kinks out.  i'm sure we'll go back for more indian food in a few weeks, and perhaps they'll be a more smooth operation by then.  i think we would easily give 4 stars next time for more good food and improved service!\u000a\u000aalso the food is well-priced, at least compared to indian food i've had in chicago!  good bang for your buck.  and they offer "mild, medium, hot, and indian hot" spice levels.  we went for medium and still got a pleasant tingle on our lips while being able to taste the flavors at the same time.

Vwhat can i say? i love indian food but all indian restaurants taste the same to me, like those heat and serve pouches of food you can buy off the shelf at your local grocery store. of course i had the buffet and maybe if i ordered off the menu my opinion would be slightly different but as it stands i am neither impressed nor disgusted.\u000a\u000a a coworker of mine is from india and makes food to bring to work then shares it, its amazingly flavorful unlike anything you can find at a restaurant, at least any of the ones i have been to around here. now that she is in india visiting family for a few months i don't know where to get my fix, maybe ill return to coriander or maybe ill just go pick up one of those pouches. \u000a\u000ap.s. the service is great, unlike its main competitors

Vcame back for dinner on a sunday night - the place was way less crowded then it was when we first visited.  could be that it was not a popular day to go out to eat, or that the excitement of the grand opening has died down, or it could be that we came during the steelers/jets playoff game and everyone was at a bar somewhere.  whichever.  it was quieter, in a good way.  they have a full bar now, and the tvs were playing the game, not bollywood movies.\u000a\u000awe got the buffet, which i think was about $10.  they had a pretty good selection of things - several vegetarian offerings (aloo gobi, chana masala, potatoes in spinach, paneer in tomato sauce), and chicken tikka masala, tandoor chicken, goat biryani, spicy chicken wings, and various other things.  also two soups, a little salad area, a handful of condiments/chutneys, and a few sweet dessert-ish things.  and naan.\u000a\u000aeverything was pretty good - on the lukewarm side, as per usual for a buffet, but i appreciated the wide variety of options.  it was a good deal for the price.  still, i think the quality (and temperature) of the food is higher when you order off the menu.  nothing wowed me enough to bump them up to a four-star review.  it was standard indian buffet fare - tasty, well-priced, all the usual suspects.  but next time i want to get the more creative and spicy options that aren't on the buffet line!

Vsquirrel hill is starting to step up the culinary scene, y'all!  coriander is delicious, authentic (well, that's what my indian friends tell me), and reasonably priced.  i've been twice now, and each time we've eaten family style with the friends we were with so that everyone could try multiple dishes.  now, everything was good, but the goat sagwala was the stand out dish.  that type of good where you start to get sad upon seeing that it's almost gone, or you want to stab your bff for taking the last bite.  the goat is tender and not too gamy, the spices are perfectly blended, complementing the spinach and the goat.  seriously, get this dish.  \u000a\u000abecause i'm not terribly familiar with the names of indian dishes, i can't list everything i've had there, but i've liked it all.  the menu is pretty extensive, with several subheadings including a chinese-indian section.  i haven't tried the buffet, but unless you're in a hurry, i would recommend ordering off the menu.  the service at coriander is attentive and pleasant, and they're happy to make recommendations.

Vmy first time going to coriander, i was seriously unimpressed. the naan was gooey, and the chicken tikka masala wasn't cutting it (the chicken chunks were, considering that they are drowning in sauce, dry). but, coriander has redeemed itself on the second try, and i'm now willing to come back again. \u000a\u000anaan was much better this time - fluffy. we had the saag paneer, which was exceptionally creamy, in a way that made it almost too rich. we also had a vegetarian dish that uses the korma sauce, which i thought was delicious. finally, we also tried one of their house specialties (which comes from a particular region of india, can't recall the particulars now, but they are in their own special section in the menu) and boy was that stuff strong. spicy both in terms of spices used and in terms of heat. i couldn't handle it, even though we had requested everything to be mild.\u000a\u000aso, overall, not a bad place to go, and we'll probably come back again. i still prefer taste of india (on penn), but the service here is nice and this is much closer.

Vhmmm, indian food...never had it.  but this past year has been about discovering new things and attempting to step outside of my comfort zone.  for some odd reason i thought this was going to be and experience like ben stiller had in one of his movies.  but not to fear, i had a wonderful time.\u000a\u000awhen we walked in, and i may add that was the only downfall, we were not greeted.  in fact we stood there for a few minutes and then were acknowledged from across the room by an employee who kind of nodded and then threw up the peace sign...er, i mean "two" sign, indicating how many were in our party.  have i mentioned i have never tried indian food before?  oh, yeah, i suppose i have.  so looking over the menu was bit of a task for me.  having to read the description to almost everyone of the items before deciding on the mango chicken curry.  after selecting the spice level, everything was smooth sailing after that.\u000a\u000athe ambiance in here was quite pleasant as well.  had the indian flair and the music coming from the tvs was quite entrancing.  coming back here would be a delight for me.  who said that stepping out of the box was a bad idea?

Vy'know, in passing by this place it's hard not to get nostolgic.  my parents used to take me here all the time when i was a kid.  these days i'll sometimes get gifts here for my niece allison and my nephew brian.  s.w. randall emphasizes toys and games based on their play value http://www.swrandalltoys.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&itemid=61  i've bought my niece and nephew games, dolls, legos, etc here.  ah, but they are growing kids and one day they're gonna be too old for a place like this.  my husband rick and i don't have kids of our own.\u000a\u000athere just aren't a lot of toy stores like this anymore (thank you walmart).  it's a fun place to come in and look around.

Visn't it interesting how a predominately chinese restaurant has a japanese name?  last i looked, osaka is in japan, not china!  the reason is probably because they serve sushi and sashimi here.  \u000a\u000aotherwise this place seems like it's pretty much your typical americanized chinese food restaurant with your typical lunch menu.  there's a difference though.  the food here is really really good!  in fact they charge a couple of bucks more than most places for their lunch menu but it's worth it.  i went for my usual chicken & broccoli, however the chicken was very tender and juicy and the broccoli was crisp and fresh.  the spring roll was very light and melted in my mouth.  someone else said this place is possibly second only to chinatown inn for this type of chow.  hmmm--i'd say first chinatown inn, then sesame inn & osaka in a tie for second.

Vbrasserie 33 is run by the same people who run la casa.  if you've ever been to la casa, you know that they're a little eccentric, but they're fun and make for an interesting evening :)\u000a\u000awe had a lovely time punctuated by great food and service.  we brought our own bottle of wine since other reviews had mentioned their wines were pricey.  the owner was impress with our wine taste, so he negotiated a bit on the corkage fee ;)  the tables are placed closely together, and the waiters wear traditional black vests with long white aprons, reminding me of new orleans.  the kitchen is indeed open, and there's a cool metal sculpture over the oven.  i like being able to watch the kitchen work, and neither of us thought it was smokey in the restaurant. \u000a\u000ai started with the escargot, and my husband had the beef tartare.  both were excellent, but mine needed a little salt and lemon.  the beef was exceptionally fresh.  we moved on the the cassoulet and canard de cassis (duck).  i must admit that the look of the cassoulet turned me off initially because it kind of looked like pork & beans beans, but my concerns were quickly assuaged when i took a bite. complex, delicious, and a large portion-- it comes with a sausage link, lamb and duck quarter.  the canard de cassis was fantastic!  the sauce was divine, and the duck was succulent.  finally, we ended with creme brulee and a hazelnut pastry.  both were scrumptious.  there was a minor problem during dining, and the waitstaff immediately rectified the situation and comped us on the bill.\u000a\u000athe food prices were actually not that bad, especially considering the quality and quantity.  we'll be returning!

Vbienvenue vers la france!  brasserie 33 is a very charming parisian cafe with lots of adoring repeat customers.  if you don't appreciate the appeal and ambiance of that, you should probably stay away.  but this place is quintessentially french with lots of traditional french dishes.  yes, our waitress slipped in a couple small ways, however it was her first night on the job, and we ended up having a fabulous evening. i ordered the vol-au-vent au poulet et champignons for an appetizer, and it was wonderfully dark, rich and savory.  for the main course i had the cassoulet, which was also marvelous.  i topped off the evening with the crme brle, and it was prepared as authentically as i have ever tasted it.

Vthis place was "okay." it's basically your standard french fare, but slightly subpar: the food was perfectly palatable, but not delicious. the service was also okay but not great. the vegetables on my salmon dish were kind of sad, and some of the ingredients in the salad were subpar.\u000a\u000ai probably never would have tried this place except for the groupon which made it half price, and i probably won't go out of my way to go back without a groupon. for the quality of food, i believe it was overpriced. one benefit is that the place is shabby enough that you can get away with wearing nearly anything to dinner. definitely casual.

Vwe finally made it to pho van to use our groupon, just two days before it expired!  that's how we roll, last-minute style.  we moseyed in on wednesday around 7 pm - about half the tables were full, and two tables were set up for outdoor dining for those of you who like to people-watch in the strip district!  we chose a table inside, in the "spartan" dining room, as my boyfriend called it.  there isn't really much decor or atmosphere at all - just a simple room with tables and chairs - nothing to focus on but your dining partner and the food!\u000a\u000awe ordered the crispy rolls first, which arrived hot and with their texture as advertised.  you can taste the meaty pork inside them!  then we got bowls of pho - mine with rare eye of round, my boyfriend's with brisket.  my meat did indeed arrive rare and red, but after a few minutes swim in the broth, it continued to cook and developed a more uniform brown color.  the bowls were huge and just full of noodles!  we took a few sips of the hot broth and instantly, any stress or pain melted away.  wow, that stuff was lovely.  aromatic, herbal, delightful.  i doctored mine a little bit with basil leaves and bean sprouts, but surprisingly we didn't add any sriracha at first.  i love spicy food, but the broth tasted so lovely on its own, i didn't feel the need.  we ended up adding some later, which did add a nice kick but it changes the flavor slightly.  \u000a\u000athe food was so inexpensive - $7 for a giant bowl - we each took half home for lunch the next day.  so that's basically $3.50 per meal.  a steal!  and it was such a pleasure to eat - it was....peaceful food, if that makes any sense.  our server was also friendly and fast.  we both felt like this was a great use of groupon - we tried a new place, and liked it enough that we plan to come back!   everybody wins!

Vi had amazing service at pho van, really speedy, thoughtful and attentive service.  the pho was also very good.  i especially like they were generous with the lime during a time when the price of limes has more than doubled. i like that the pho is served traditional style with the  fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime and chiles on the side.  the decor is not much, but the place is very clean and orderly.

Vi'm not much of a gym person so when a friend asked me to join the gym with him i was a bit pessimistic.  i've tried going to a 24 hour gym before but didn't have the motivation to keep up with it.  it's been three months since i started at the gym and i'm a bit addicted now.\u000a\u000athe conveinence of having the gym so close to where i live is a huge plus.  it being in edgewood isn't convienent for people in other parts of the city however.  the price is right to if you want to do the gym on the cheap, $10 a month, if you want to tan yourself silly, the perk will cost you $20 a month for the membership.  the place is always clean, the staff keep on top of that task, evidence by them always cleaning the machines.  \u000a\u000aas for the 'lunk alarm' it scares the crap out of you if someone drops a weight.  the locker rooms kind of remind you of being in a high school locker room, but it is a great perk to be able to shower there especially if you need to run somewhere afterwards.

Vi really can't add to anything that hasn't been said in the previous posts so i'll just keep this to minimum. for $20 a month i get unlimited tanning which is a value on its own and it's 24 hours so i can go blow off some steam after working an evening shift.

Vi had been a member of this planet fitness for a couple years before i cancelled my membership last month. what i liked about it was the $10 a month membership,  access 24/7 and the free purple ink pens. \u000a\u000ai never had any problems finding a cardio machine as there are plenty. the free weight area is actually small and, as spacious as this entire facility is, the free weight area could've been expanded. it was so. . .tight.\u000a\u000athe women's locker room is okay. there are 3-4 showers that get cleaned regularly throughout the day and two changing stalls. the water fountains outside of the locker rooms seem to break down repeatedly. in that case you can a get free bottle of water.\u000a\u000aonce a month pf has complimentary bagels  and the next week they have complimentary pizza- both are one day events. i've only eaten one bagel and one slice of pizza during my entire membership. \u000a\u000ai give this planet fitness at edgewood town center 4 stars, but i give the entire chain 3 stars. why? i do not like pf's hypocritical "judgement free zone" philosophy. okay, i think i get it. it's important for someone out of shape to have a safe, supportive environment to work out. but if pf is really "judgement free," why are people who lift weights, wear tanks and drink water called "lunks"? why is there a "lunk alarm" at the gym? this explains why the free weight area is so small!

Vfriendly. comfortably like a hippie student union. various dusty couches and third hand furniture, live music, old musty wood and a lot of different rooms. some floor-seating. \u000a\u000aeveryone's friendly enough. the food is dense, ethical, simple and good. temaki pasta was huge portioned. grilled cheese was small, sharp cheddar and crusty bread. good beer options if you want to try local beers.

Vi am a popcorn fiend, and ppc meets all my fiendish needs! the popcorn is always *so good.* i think they typically have around 7 standard flavors, and then a flavor of the week. wisconsin cheddar is my stand-by. so cheesy, and not artificial tasting at all, like some of the store brands. you can mix up y our flavors as well, and a fav around the lab here is the chicago style-- cheddar and caramel popcorn mixed together. it's a bit pricey for popcorn, but well worth an occasional splurge (calorically and monetarily).\u000a\u000athis oakland location is on 5th ave, right smack in the middle of pitt. they have gift certificates in $10 and $20 set values.

Vlocated on pittsburgh's south side, the hot metal street bridge was originally a dual railroad bridge owned by the monongahela connecting railroad (the monconn).  the monconn used it to connect steel mills on both the north and south banks of the monongahela river.  the upstream span carried regular freight trains.  the downstream span carried train cars of  molten iron across from j&l's eliza furnaces to the bessemer converters, furnaces and rolling mills at j&l's south side works. \u000a\u000awhen the j&l south side works closed, the bridge no longer had a use.  with new development on the south side, one span was redeveloped for auto use and it now connects hot metal street on the south side with 2nd avenue in oakland.  a few years ago the other span was redone and is now used for bicyclists and pedestrians.  it's a part of the three rivers trail system.\u000a\u000ai've never driven across it, but i've used the bike span on numerous occasions.  it's a great way to get from the south side to oakland or to connect between the three rivers trail and the eliza furnace trail.  those trails along with the bridge are a fun way to explore pittsburgh's industrial past.

Vpittsburgh should have the nickname 'reusable city.'  honestly, pittsburgh doesn't leave anything to waste.  i mean, take this set of two bridges.  they could have just tore them down and left it at that.\u000a\u000abut no, they decided that they would reuse these bridges and help alleviate the flow of traffic, both by car and by foot/bike, into and out of the city.  granted, it's not the best bridge to cross if you are attempting to get somewhere quickly, but like all its other counterparts in the city, it's unique.  travelling across this bridge at the wrong time of day could cause you to wait for an extended amount of time, with that, i would suggest take the non-scenic route.\u000a\u000athese two bridges help many people cross the mon.  one for vehicular traffic and one for pedestrian/bicycle traffic.  the vehicular one open many months before the pedestrian bridge.  i remember the ado there was when the pedestrian bridge was under construction and how excited people were knowing that they would soon be able to get downtown via the trails.\u000a\u000awhen the neon like lights are lit on the bridge at night, it gives it a little more character.  if not for congestion, this would be an ideal crossing.

Vi am writing a review of mansions as a music venue.  this is a unique location to dine and listen to live music.  because it's a small hotel, the staff is very attentive to the smallest needs and is very willing to help.  it's fun just to look around the place.  the acoustics are wonderful for live music, there's a lot of beautiful woodwork, and so the sound is live and warm.  i have eaten at the brunch and the food was wonderful, lots of choices from a buffet, and top quality and well prepared food.    definitely worth visiting.  i will come back often.

Vi think this thing was following me around this city this past week.  smart move, very smart move.  how could i resist that temptation to have a hot dog whenever i want it?  i mean, to be able to walk up, tell them i want a hot dog and ta-da my wish is granted.\u000a\u000adelicious, delicious, delicious, that's all i can say about this place (or should i say truck since it is not bolted to the ground?). i stuck to the standard dog, no one can go wrong with that.  i was so tempted to try the memphis dog, but i got my old reliable.  i also wanted some poutine, but, to no fault of their own, they were out!  i mean you can't hold that against them if they ran out because everyone wanted some.\u000a\u000aif i wouldn't go broke because of my appetite for some good hot dogs, i would follow this truck around the entire city.  i'd put a tracking device on that thing.\u000a\u000astaff personalities range depending on the day and the amount of people in line.  huge bonus that they take cards too, it's a love/hate thing for technology.  swipe my card and then watch me sign the screen like a kindergarten student.\u000a\u000agod, i feel like after writing this i could be like jennifer coolidge in the legally blonde movie.  "makes me want a hot dog real bad!"

Vnow let me start this review off by putting out the disclaimer that i am not the biggest hotdog fan however these are some damn good hotdogs!\u000a\u000ai went with the under dog (a new zealand grass fed beef hotdog) i added onions, ketchup, mustard, relish, hot sauce, bacon and a little mayo. it was epic! the casing on the dog had a nice snap to it. every bite was like a exposion of different flavors. there was defiantly a party going on in my mouth! the toasted bun was a nice touch also.\u000a\u000ai also had a order of frites. (hand cut fries)  they were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.\u000a\u000athey also offer poutine frites (hand cut fries with fresh cheese curds and gravy) and drinks including mexican coca cola, san pellegrino sodas and snapple iced tea.\u000a\u000afor around 10 bucks you can get a dog, fries and a drink. not bad at all in my book.

Vstayed here over a weekend in the summer.  it was during the arts festival, so bad decision on my part there.  traffic during that time of the year is horrible.  you have to explain to about three cops why you are turning down commonwealth place before they believe you.  \u000a\u000acheck in is simple, elevators take a bit, getting settled doesn't take any time.  \u000a\u000athe view i had from my room was amazing, facing the point, it was gorgeous.  room was nicely put together.  but here's where my complaints start.  there 'free wi-fi' was spotty at best.  a full signal one second and then nothing after that.  more times than not i was forced to use the cord at a desk that had no chair.  yes, no chair.  so either kneel on the floor or stand, doesn't make for getting much done at the computer easy.  the vending machines sucked.  i went to receive a water out of one because i know how "awesome" pittsburgh water is.  both buttons designated for water promptly spat out grape sodas at me.  parking kind of sucked, pay to have it valet, or pay to have it in the garage across the street.\u000a\u000athank god it was located in the downtown area, i could walk to a store at least.

Vwhen i come here, i swear i sometimes see a little old korean grandma in the back, cooking everything.  that's kind of awesome.  also awesome?  the fact that they have a karaoke bar.  that you can rent out for your friends.  wow - pittsburgh really has come along!\u000a\u000afood here is on the pricey side, but is really good.  the kalbi definitely satisfies my cravings, but at 20+ is kind of a splurge.  we normally get the bulgolgi when we're not feeling up to spending that much.\u000a\u000ai do miss all the little kimchi dishes - here, they serve everything up in bento boxes.  so, it's not quite like what you'd expect from korean places in either new york or san fran, but given the paucity of korean places in pittsburgh, i'm not going to grumble too much.  like dennis l., i'm not \u000agoing to say i love this place, but given the circumstances, it's solid.\u000a\u000aif you're really craving the korean bbq experience, my understanding is that korean palace in oakland is the way to go.  i haven't been there in years, since i refuse to deal with the parking situation in oakland, but hey, when you want korean food, sometimes you just gotta suck it up.  in the meantime, green pepper might be enough to keep you from having to go off the deep end.

Vwhen i first heard that john hiatt would be playing at the carnegie library in munhall, i thought "you've gotta be kidding me.  why is one of the most gifted songwriters in all of pop/rockdom playing at a fricking library?"  see that's how wyep billed it.  like darren w. states, this place is a well-kept secret.  i'd never been to the carnegie library of homestead (which is actually in munhall).  so what i didn't know was that it's a beautiful 1,000 seat auditorium.  \u000a\u000aeverything about this library including the music hall harkens back to the gilded age.  built in 1898, the music hall mainly  hosted local community shows, church productions, and graduations.  . but seeking to draw more visitors from outside the neighborhood -- and help the independent library's bottom line -- library officials decided to start booking major concerts at the music hall.  it was renovated in 1998 and since then has hosted such acts as hiatt, patti smith, bare naked ladies, toad the wet sprocket, etc.  lindsey buckingham, drive by truckers, and jon anderson (formerly of yes) are all slated to play here later this year.\u000a\u000athe building itself seems to be of a baroque design, common to public buildings of that era.  i'm no architectural expert, so correct me if i'm wrong.  the performance space is quite amazing.  when entering, i was taken by the huge curtain acress the stage and the illuminated proscenium arch overhead.  there are a few drawbacks though.  first of all, parking around here is v-e-r-y limited.  they have no lot, so you have to park on the street.  second of all, refreshments here are very limited too.  they set up a temporary bar for each show.  third of all, the seats are all wooden so they get a little uncomfortable after awhile.\u000a\u000aas for john hiatt, i think the trib live described him best, stating that while you might not know his face nor even heard of him, you've probably heard his songs.   bonnie raitt had a  hit with , "thing called love" (though she really altered it). "riding with the king," was a hit for  b.b. king (appropriately, though "the king" is a reference to elvis presely) and eric clapton as a duet.  others including \u000akenny rogers, jewel, delbert mcclinton, joe cocker, mandy moore, and linda ronstadt have had hits with hiatt's songs.  even jon bon jovi did a version of   "have a little faith."\u000a\u000ahiatt's songs are well known for their wry wit.  one of my favorite verses in all musicdom is from "slow turning":  "and i'm yelling at the kids in the back/'cos they're banging like-a charlie watts".  hiatt likes to name drop in some of his songs.  "shredding the document" mentions both larry king and oprah winfrey.  anyway, hiatt tours extensively and he seems to be an old pro at performing live and that's a good thing.\u000a\u000ayou know an artist is still a vaiable songwriter and performer when you stick around for his new material.  he did some  songs from his new cd "dirty jeans and mudslide hymns" which were just as good as anything else he's recorded.  and of course he went through a lot of his classic songs like the aforementioned "slow turning" plus "memphis in the meantime", "thing called love", and "cry love" among others.  \u000a\u000aopening act was big head todd & the monsters, probably best known for "please don't tell her".  todd & co. delivered a rollicking good set too.  \u000a\u000ai'm at the point now where i'd rather see a show at a venue like this than fork over megabucks for a concert at some mccorporate-name-of-the-month shed.  i'm glad there are still great alternatives to shows sponsored by live nation.  come check out a show here at the library some time!

Vwith 6,148,036 volumes, the hillman library comes in 29th on the list of largest libraries in the united states.    i especially like the cafe, cup and chaucer, which sometimes features live music.  the library features an extensive digital archives collection, including the historic pittsburgh maps collection.

Vmeh. this location still has a few wrinkles to iron out. been there twice so far the first (early in the a.m.) was friendly, fast, efficient. our server was someone you would expect to be named flo, she was awesome. the second time was in the afternoon and was weird. the staff seemed confused, we had 3 different servers say they would be right with us, the one we ended up with kept suggesting meat entrees after i told her im a vegetarian and knew what i wanted already. the food is what you expect from an ihop.

Vgetting into this place at 11am on a sunday is harder than getting into  ft. knox! sadly, the food is not really worth the wait, but it's ihop or eat 'n park, so what you gonna do? it could have been my fault. i tried their biscuits and gravy, and they were destined to disappoint. maybe i'll stick with just eggs and hash browns next time i have to go out for breakfast. on the upside, the service was quite friendly and fast.

Vi was so happy when i heard that this location had opened. we patiently waited a few months for all of the hype to die down and for all the kinks of opening a new restaurant to be gone before we went. \u000a\u000aso tamika and i went on a weekday around 8am. we were seated immediately and ordered our drinks. a couple minutes later our drinks came. we then ordered our food. i got steak and hash browns with a stack of pancakes. tamika got some type of breakfast platter with pancakes, eggs and corn beef hash. my steak tasted like liver but the hash browns were tasty and the pancakes were delicious! tamika liked her platter but ,had to repeatedly remind the server to bring her corn beef hash. it was gross once she got it! it looked like it came out of a can! \u000a\u000athe service sucked. our waitress had really crappy attitude! once we got our food our waitress vanished off the face of the earth for at least a half an hour. \u000a\u000awhat i don't get is by 8:45 there were about 20 to 30 people waiting to be seated and they had a whole empty section but wouldn't seat anyone there. wth? it's like when you wait in a long line to get into a club and when you finally get inside there's only 5 people in the whole club. \u000a\u000ai had to constantly ask for a refill on my oj and tamika's coffee. i love ihop and have been to quite a few in different states but this location was a complete disappointment. i would have been much happier at pamela's or even the original pancake house! \u000a\u000ainsider tip: get here between 8 and 8:30 to avoid the morning rush.

Vyou know, i used to have this out of town romance that left a sweetness in my mouth.  the only way i could get a fix was if i left pittsburgh behind me and headed for warmer climates.  not so much anymore, you made me happy ihop with finally opening your doors a few years back here in the region.\u000a\u000aas for the most recent visit to your lovely location outside of greenfield/squirrel hill, there were many ups, and a few downs.  \u000a\u000ai was going to do the ups first and then do the downs, but they kind of mix together so i'm just gonna go through it all at once.\u000a\u000acongrats on finally being open 24 hours!  not so big congrats to advertise it.  i didn't notice it on the sign if you were open 24 hours, and the parking lot looks shady when you pull up and see no cars in the lot and you have to do a parking lot circle to make sure.  the lettering you use on the door is quite small too.  even with my glasses, i was still squinting to see if you were open.  as soon as i saw '24' on the door, the car went into park and i was heading for the door.\u000a\u000aas late as it was at night, my friend and i were the only two people besides the workers in the building.  big plus for us, no wait.  service was super fast if you couldn't have guessed.\u000a\u000ahere's something i learned as well, the menu changes at 10 p.m.  not a big deal for me as i was getting pancakes, as it is the international house of pancakes.  as for my friend, she was really hoping to get the garden crepes.  so when the server came our way to take the order she went back to ask the cook if she wouldn't mind making it for her and the answer was something along the lines of 'sure, i'll make it.'  big props for making these two customers feel happy about that.  one thing, my sausage did end up looking like bacon...but i ate it anyway.\u000a\u000aok, so this has to be categorized as a down, there's no way to put a happy spin on it.  the bathrooms...what in the world went on in the bathroom?  it looks as if somebody was having a battle royale in the one.  maybe somebody was fighting a demon much like they do in the show charmed.  i mean thank god i didn't mistake the styrofoam cups for having anything else but soap in them.  also, this place is really showing it's wear.  it hasn't been open that long, but it sure needs a bit of tlc and updating.

Vi prefer to do it myself at home but, this is a pretty decent car wash when in a pinch and your car needs to be cleaned. it is a brushless carwash were you pay and then pull in and your car is cleaned. it does a surprisingly decent job too.\u000a\u000athere are a couple of do it yourself bays also.

Vwell worth the $50 groupon for full detailing! the two guys running the joint were nice and accommodating to some last minute changes in the saturday appointment. they thoroughly cleaned the inside and outside of my poor jetta that hadn't been cleaned in nearly 3 years, and were genuinely appreciative of the tip (which i appreciate). they also seem to have some do-it-yourself bays with vacuum and air pumps, but i suggest letting the pros do it!

Vthis chipotle was there right when we needed it - around 9 pm on a wednesday when we were stumbling to the bus stop after the yelp elite event at olive or twist.  we needed food to help soak up our free cocktails, and we needed it now!  what better way then with a yummy burrito?  service was fast and friendly, and we got our burritos to go so that we could sit in market square and people-watch.  we listened to the music coming out of nola, and nommed our burrito snacks.  i always enjoy chipotle, sometimes even craving it, and i like how they aim to serve sustainably raised ingredients.  it's always super satisfying and tasty, and you get exactly what you are hoping for.  and this one is in a great location, perfect for sitting outside and relaxing.

Vi ordered pad thai with tofu. the tofu was packed with flavor - a very pleasant surprise. too bad the rest of the dish was quite bland and flavorless. the pad thai noodles were mushy and everything was just...there. it's a good thing they offer chopped peanuts, siracha, and other accoutrement to jazz up the dish.\u000a\u000aprices, portions and convenience are superb but quality just isn't up to par.

Vif you happen to find yourself in oakland and in need of a quick lunch time fix, walk on down to bigelow blvd and give one of the street vendors a try. \u000a\u000ai previously ordered from thai express- it was 2:30ish and they were out of pad thai already so i had to settle for something else that i can't remember so i guess it didn't leave that big of an impression on me. id give it another try though.\u000a\u000ai digress,  it was around 1 and i had a craving for something, but couldn't pinpoint what that something was. i knew i wanted it spicy and i wanted it now so i drove to oakland from greenfield with $6 and got a whole container of fluffy white rice topped with spicy palak paneer. the cheese cubes held up nicely to the velvety spinach. it satisfied my craving and didn't put a hole in my wallet.  \u000a\u000afor $5 and 5 minutes of your time, you can't beat india on wheels.

Vevery once and a while, it's nice to walk down to the food trucks on bigelow and get some non-cafeteria food. india on wheels is the only one i've been to, but i like them. the lady running it is really nice, the food is tasty, and the price is right. get your food, then head on over to the steps of soldiers and sailors, and have a nice lunch not in a cubicle in front of a computer. :)\u000a\u000acash only.

Vafter reading the previous reviews i'm a bit confused.  maybe it's because i got delivery and didn't step foot in the door.\u000a\u000ai actually enjoyed the food.  the "smaller portion" as their menu put it is the same size as other restaurants regular portions.  i got my old reliable general tso's, nice portion of meat to rice and an egg came with the combo.\u000a\u000ai even waited a day to write this to make sure that i wasn't going to feel all that bad.  i'll definitely go back here, especially for the price.

Vi love that they're open late (often 2 or 3 am), but the food has just been so-so the last couple of times i went. i think the tacos at round corner cantina are far superior to these, and the burritos here are sub-par too. decent if you need a late night snack, but not worth going out of your way for.

Vpimped out and fun!  kudos to the staff who are very attentive and  make you feel very special.  we were greeted promptly and our coats were checked.  our waiter was superb and helpful, plus we loved his russian accent, which was charming.  the salad was very good, although i was fairly certain that the gorgonzola cheese in the salad was not the genuine gorgonzola from italy.  there was an unexpected  raspberry sorbet to cleanse the pallet, which was great.  we got the lobster with scallops and the filet mignon, and both were prepared to perfection.  my mashed potatoes were not very flavorful, but otherwise, everything else was delicious.  for desert we split the chocolate cake, which was very creatively prepared and presented.  the music playing was a little too loud for conversation, but it was earth wind and fire, michael jackson, and al green, all really fun songs.

Vi had heard about savoy for years. about how beautiful the space was and how expensive the food was but, i had never went for dinner. i had tasted savoy's food before at the pittsburgh magazines best restaurants party multiple times and at the yelp tech shop event and at the yelp's soire @ savoy elite event. each time the food was very good.\u000a\u000ai saw a $49 groupon deal for savoy that i couldn't pass up that included two entrees and one dessert of your choice. i decided to check them out for a date night with my wife tamika so we could finally see what all the fuss was about. \u000a\u000anow let me tell you about the space. all i can say is wow! it is absolutely beautiful. savoy has to be one of the most beautiful spaces in pittsburgh. once inside you fill like you've been transported to atlanta, new york or miami. it was created by pittsburgh designer luca paganico and transformed an dated three story building into a posh and intimate restaurant with leather couches and chairs, a fiber optic bar, and walls with lighting that changes color as patrons dine. upstairs in the lounge area was just as beautiful. with four separate sectional couch areas with tvs on the wall. i know it had to cost a fortune to build and furnish the space.\u000a\u000awe started off with drinks. i had the peach on peach and the mrs. had the blueberry mojito. the drinks took a while to reach the table but, once they did they were worth the wait.\u000a\u000anext we enjoyed a complementary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. it was very good followed by an amazing lemon sorbet to cleanse our palates.\u000a\u000afor our entrees i had the n.y. strip steak with compressed mushrooms, yukon whipped potatoes and haricots verts. the streak was cooked perfectly and just how i asked for it to be cooked. my only complaint is that the sauce for the streak was extremely salty. also like when the salt was added the top was loose and salt got dumped onto my plate. \u000a\u000amy wife had the pork chops which was one of the dinner features that night. her pork chops were even more salty then my steak so she only ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. savoy does offer quite a few gluten free dining options as well\u000a\u000afor dessert we shared the salted carmel chocolate torte. (roasted banana ice cream, milk chocolate cashew bark and chocolate fondue) it was even chosen as savor pittsburgh's dish of the year for 2013. it was amazing! \u000a\u000aservice was superb the entire evening. i also like the fact that you can make reservations right from the savoy website which are a must as the space only seats about 75 people.\u000a\u000aall in all savoy is a nice place that i would visit for sure for drinks during happy hour and go somewhere else for dinner. i just cannot with a clear conscience justify the prices without a groupon deal.

Vi came in and sat down to look at the menu, and started chatting with the chef like it was a sushi bar. turns out i was talking to none other than shipwreck himself, so his recommendation was fairly obvious. we got a shipwreck, a falafel burger, an order of fries, and a side of cole slaw - i have to try the cole slaw everywhere i go... i almost never like it as much as i hope, but i've gotta know. blame my inner yinzer.\u000a\u000athe food was quick and the wait staff was super nice, they joked around with us, and even though this place orders like a fast food joint(order at the counter, sit down and you'll get served), the girls come around, refill your drinks, clean up after you, etc. i ran into service like this at los cabos, as well and i have to say, i don't like paying - more specifically tipping - before i get my food. not that i would tip any more or less unless the service was amazing or awful, but it just seems to go against the spirit - more like i'm trying to please the establishment that will be handling my food prep with a number than the other way around.\u000a\u000aanyways, that was just an aside - i really loved the fries, some of them were super crispy, it's hard to find them like that in a lot of places but i love them. the burgers came exactly as we asked for them and they were well presented and covered in toppings. amazing that they make it all the way to the counter neatly stacked, as they seem to get messy instantly upon picking them up. well the shipwreck did, anyways. \u000a\u000athe coleslaw was good. i like it a little creamier but it beats primanti's(as if that's hard to do).. i could definitely eat it, instead of taking a bite and wishing i had grabbed something else.\u000a\u000ai didn't try the falafel, unfortunately, i was way too stuffed from trying to eat every last fry(i failed), and it seemed really heavy(i mean it's a giant wad of solid chickpea mass), so half of that remains in our fridge for round two.\u000a\u000ai spoke with shipwreck a bit more about the place, he said the liquor should flow within a few weeks. i caught a meeting with victory brewing company(thanks for the golden monkey sample a few nights ago, victory lady!), so expect them on tap(not to divulge any trade secrets!)\u000a\u000aoverall, i like this place, and i will like it more when i can grab a drink here. i think the atmosphere is spot on and the people are definitely friendly enough to hang out with, with or without a burger in hand. the pizzas looked good, so that will probably on my list next time.\u000a\u000aunfortunately, the burger has yet to beat out my favorite, kuma's corner in chicago, but i'll take this on a regular basis to kuma's less than once a year.

Vstage ae was probably not the best place to see a concert on a -blah- kind of night in late september.  seriously, who schedules an outdoor concert so close to october?  we went here to see ray lamontagne and the pariah dogs in concert.  rachel's right, the lawn section is probably the best place to be if you wanna see.  we'd never been to stage ae before and had the weather been better, we would have probably enjoyed it a little more.  it's really a great facility though--one the city should be proud of.\u000a\u000aso how was the concert?\u000a\u000awell, you remember the scene in "the simpsons" many years ago (back when it was actually funny) in which james taylor angrily says, "hey, i'm not as mellow as you think i am.  now here's the deal--i'm gonna sing and you're gonna listen"?  well the same thing happened at the concert.  seems like ray got a little tired of \u000acompeting  with "the small talk and chatter" from a drinking crowd (to paraphrase his current single  "beg steal or borrow").  and he stopped the show and cursed out the talkers, offering them a refund if they left.\u000a\u000awow! \u000a\u000abut anyway, to those of you who may not have heard of ray lamontagne, you've probably heard one of his songs.  "trouble" was used in the traveler's commercial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk2b8988ws0  lamontagne's style is kind of a mix of bluesy, folksy, jazzy, & singer-songwriter.  he played a lot off his new cd "god willing & the creek don't rise" which seems to have a lot of new orleans, post-katrina influences in it.  he also ran through some of his other material including "trouble", "repo man", and he did a cover of the byrd's song "blue canadian rockies", and he even had a couple members of the opening act, punch brothers, join him on stage for a couple of covers.\u000a\u000astill for what should have been a mellow night, i'll just never get over him telling the audience, "hey, you a-holes, sftu or go the f--k home, i'll give you your money back."   too bad too, because he's got one of the most distinctive voices around.

Vwe came here for lunch on new years day, and i was disappointed to find they were running a special menu instead of the delicious one that i saw online!  still, we pulled up to a low table and decided to make the best of it.  milk is a very cute little cafe where they make everything fresh, and it's a very cosy place to spend an afternoon.  i had a pot of peppermint tea while my fianc had a latte, and i eventually ordered poached eggs on chunky bread with spinach salad, which came with a juice.  i think we got the lemon and ginger juice (or was it lime and mint??) but either way it was so refreshing and lovely.  the eggs were just perfect, and the thick bread underneath was just gorgeous.  a big, hearty piece from an artisan loaf.  spinach was lightly dressed with a tangy dressing.  a simple breakfast, but very well made.  my fianc got the slow-roasted pork wrap in flatbread with herbs and slaw, which was nice of them to make since it wasn't on the special menu that day but he'd been looking forward to having it.  we both enjoyed it, the meat did have a nice flavor, but he found the wrap too small and not quite as good as he'd hoped.  he had to grab a healthy little carrot-nut muffin (which was quite scrumptious) to-go afterwards since he wasn't full up!\u000a\u000ait's a bit out of the way, but they have such a cool cafe menu.  great stop if you're on the way to the modern art gallery and want something cheap, cheerful, and homemade.  very friendly staff as well, though there aren't many of them and it can take quite a while to get your food and drinks on a busy day.

Vmmmmm...\u000afinally, a veggie burger that isn't just thawed out and reheated! burgatory is absolutely delicious. we had a bit of a wait and it was mildly frustrating to see how slow the staff was clearing tables because there were soooo many people waiting. once we were seated though, service was very fast and efficient. we started off with bangkok fries, the peanut sauce that accompanied them was light and delicious. i had to try the banana ketchup which was surprisingly yummy but to be perfectly honest the tempura fried portabella caps were quite tasty on their own.\u000a\u000athe caramel pretzel shake was fantastic, i enjoyed it immensely although i have texture issues. the pretzel bits were just soft enough without being soggy.\u000a\u000aas for our meals, i had the veggie burger and jb had the farmer burger, they both came with homemade sweet and russet potato chips and both burgers were huge. the buns were even tasty. we weren't disappointed with anything and will definitely be returning.\u000a\u000abrgr should take lessons.

Vi would agree with the other reviewers who rank burgatory above brgr in shadyside. last time i was here, i had an elk burger with a blueberry stilton, and it was absolutely amazing. add a decent beer selection & the best onion rings i've ever had, and i'm sold. it can be crowded, especially on weekends, but i've never had a hard time finding a seat at the bar.\u000a\u000aprobably the only reason to ever visit waterworks mall.

Vstill on a quest to find a tasty burger in pittsburgh, my boyfriend and i brought an out-of-town guest to burgatory on a friday night.  i knew there would be a wait, since people mention that in all the reviews, but i figured it was one of those things where they say it's a 90 minute wait, but really it's 45 minutes, you know?  yeah, not so.  they said 75-90 minutes, and i believe it truly was 90.  wowza.  the place was packed with people waiting.  if it wasn't so cold out, we'd have gone for a walk or something - they have a great text message alert system so they text you when your table is ready.  we just got some beers at the bar - they had strongbow cider on tap! - and jealously watched everyone else sitting down to eat.\u000a\u000aafter forever, we got to sit down.  service moved pretty quickly after that.  we all did the build-your-own burger option, feeling slightly overwhelmed by the decisions.  all their beef is hormone-free, which is nice, so i had no qualms about getting the regular beef burger.  i got a whole wheat bun, cracked peppercorn rub, farmhouse cheddar cheese, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and caramelized onion marmalade on mine.  also ordered fries instead of the usual potato chips that come with, but since i was so hungry and had consumed 2 beers, i can't say whether there was an extra charge for that or not.  probably.  but i wasn't paying attention.\u000a\u000ai did pay attention when i took my first bite of the burger - wow.  juicy and flavorful, perfect medium rare, leaps and bounds above any burger we've tried yet in pittsburgh.  the roasted garlic mayo was great, the avocado was fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  there was a generous side of small, crispy fries which were the perfect accompaniment.  everyone loved their meals - i know my cohorts got fried eggs on theirs, which they enjoyed - and we all agreed it was a meal worth the wait.\u000a\u000ai'd love to come back here - it reminds me of the counter in chicago, another great custom burger joint - but that wait is seriously killer.  if i return, it'll have to be on a day when i'm really in no hurry at all.  90 minutes is a long time to stand around, watching delicious food go past.  but there's a reason this place is so popular - whoever is cooking the burgers and sourcing their ingredients really knows what they are doing.

Vwe simultaneously looked at each other, having just taken our first bite, eyes widened, and we said, "we're never going to brgr again!" \u000a\u000ayou can build your own burger, ordering each component from a pre-printed sheet, kind of like ordering sushi. choose a meat, a rub, a sauce, cheese, and toppings (some free, like organic greens; and some $1, like onion strings), and cooking temperature. alternately, there's several pre made options available, including one i definitely plan on trying that's topped with an over easy egg. \u000a\u000awe also ordered their buffalo wings, and, of course, spiked shakes. buffalo wings were great-- nice and crispy with a nicely spicy sauce. the spiked shakes might be where brgr wins. i got the salted nutella shake, and added vanilla vodka. the shakes come topped with a *a lot* of home-made whipped cream, and there are big chunks of chocolate candy in the shake. both of those things tasted good, but i wanted a smooth shake, and there was just too much whipped cream for my taste. \u000a\u000aalso, on saturdays they have exotic meat burgers, and they update their website each week so that you can know when you can get that python burger you've been craving!

Vby far one of the best places to get a burger in the burgh area.  i've tried four of the six patties on the custom patties section, with different combinations of toppings/buns/rubs and cannot find a thing wrong with anything.  get a burger with fries or decide to opt out of the fries and get a mix of potato chips made from russet and sweat potatoes.  one cannot describe what can be said of the shakes, who knew that ice cream mixed with such a combination as smores could bring back memories of a childhood campfire?  the atmosphere of this location is great, especially in the summertime when you can sit anywhere in the restaurant and feel the breeze coming in from outside.  the staff is amazing and right on point.  if you show up at a busy time, instead of getting one of those annoying coaster like devises that could be used as a weapon, they can text you when your table is ready.  all in all, it's worth the trip.

Vi can't believe i haven't written a review of burgatory yet!! maybe because every time i visit, i experience a food coma and when i awake can't remember anything that happened while i was there...\u000a\u000athe food here is great.  we like coming here because the husband is a big meat fan and their veggie burgers are homemade and fantastic, which i like.  i feel like i can't give a comprehensive review because i think i've only ever ordered "create your own" versions of the veggie burger!\u000a\u000aall their shakes are amazing, but i was especially a fan of the vegan one they offered as a special a few weeks ago...keep 'em coming, even if it's just on veggie tuesdays!\u000a\u000adefinitely reccomend this place, but plan ahead as there is usually a wait--even on weeknights.

Vi just need to reiterate how much i love this place.  i mean who can go wrong with burgers?\u000a\u000amy most recent visit here included members of my family.  my family not being from the city have heard me talk about this place so much that when they came down they insisted on me taking them there.  \u000a\u000aof course when we arrived there was a wait, i told them that most likely there would be, not only because it's so good, but because we were going at a busy time.  i informed them about the system they have where they text you when you table is ready.  walked up to the podium, gave my information and decided to check out the shops nearby.  \u000a\u000agood thing we were only right next door, because what happened next totally floored me.  when i first went in and gave my name we were told that our wait would be anywhere from 30-45 minutes because we had a party of 5 adults and a child.  while we were browsing the racks in the store my phone rang, not knowing the number i did the typical thing and ignored it.  my phone than rang again and i told my family that i should answer it.  burgatory went the extra mile here.  it was them that called me and told us our table was ready, not even ten minutes into our wait!  i mean i heard of having to wait longer sometimes, but never under-waiting (is that a word?).\u000a\u000aof course our food was delicious, my little niece was definitely digging the salty nutella crunch shake we ordered.  and who can argue with those crispy mixed potato chips they give you?\u000a\u000aburgatory, you definitely got a customer for life in me.

V*homer simpson drooling sound*\u000a \u000apark bruges is a total success!  the space is wonderful & inviting.  the layout is nice and open, and it seems like there's more tables than at point brugge.  we were told a 45 minute wait on saturday night, but didn't wait for more than 20 - 30 minutes.  the dress ranged from very casual to a little dressy.  the hostess and waitstaff were all efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable.  \u000a\u000athe beer selection is ample and varied, with many high abv options.  there's about 5 beers on tap, and too many bottles to count.  i had a three philosophers quadrupel, and my friends had a brown ale from local full pint brewing co and a ephemere lambic from unibroue.  our beers ranged from about $6.00 - $7.50.\u000a\u000athe food was spot-on.  we started with the classic montreal poutine.  the gravy was more of a chicken gravy, which surprised me and others who'd had poutine before, but it was still delicious.  we continued with the moules-- one classic and one with andouille sausage and bleu cheese.  both were delicious, though the flavors in the latter are more robust than the light white white/herb sauce.  the moules didn't come out with any bread, which was disappointing, but i'm sure you could ask for some.  i had the sea scallop fettuccine.  ample sea scallops perfectly seared with a light-ish sauce and large green and red peppers.  we were all too stuffed for dessert, but i might try their chocolate martini next time!  also, i think on my next visit i'll do more of a small plates/family style dinner rather than order entrees.  i love that i have the 2 dining options at one establishment.\u000a\u000alittle trivia: they used the flemish spelling for point brugge and the french spelling for park bruges since both are spoken in belgium!

Vhaving already fallen in love with point brugge, i rejoiced at the news that they were opening another restaurant.  park bruges is not near where i live, but we made the short drive - we being myself, my boyfriend, and our two out-of-town guests.\u000a\u000aparking was not a problem, maybe a block away from the restaurant down the street.  park bruges was quite packed, and noisy, at about 7 pm on a friday.  i expected that, so we put in our name and were told a 60-90 minute wait.  i told the hostess we might get back in the car and drive around for a while to pass the time, and she offered to take my cell phone number to call when our table was ready.  i love when hostesses do that.\u000a\u000a45 minutes later, we pulled back into a parking spot and i saw the hostess standing outside, about to call me on my cell.  45 minutes on a friday at a place like this is not a bad wait at all!  we were seated near the back, where the noise level was still enthusiastic but not at all overwhelming.  our friendly server quickly approached with a carafe of water and small glasses, and rattled off the beers on draft.  i went with a leffe blonde, which i always enjoy.  everyone was happy with their beer and wine choices, and impressed by the comprehensive list.\u000a\u000astarving, we began with super-unhealthy appetizers: poutine (classic preparation) and the macaroni and cheese.  the poutine was very good, a little salty in the gravy, but a wonderfully fatty, cheesy treat.  poutine is french fries, cheese curds, and gravy for those who don't know - and it's as good as it sounds.  (even the leftovers reheated deliciously).  the macaroni and cheese was outstanding.  it was a little spicy, and arrived simply bubbling in a small baking dish.  every bite was tremendous - such high quality cheese, such great flavor - everything that kraft is not.  don't miss this app.\u000a\u000ai also ordered a spinach salad, which was way bigger than i thought (can be split easily between 2-3 people as a pre-entree snack), and came coated with yummy gorgonzola dressing, and plenty of sweet fruit like strawberries, pears, and dried cranberries.  there were some random bread pieces stuck in the salad that were kind of awkward and didn't really add much to the dish, but other than that it was good to have some veg.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend and i split one of the fish specials - mahi-mahi and rock shrimp over a rice pilaf with some veggies (leeks, and others).  it was well-prepared, light, and fresh.  everyone enjoyed their entrees, which included sauteed chicken, and striped bass in a moroccan preparation.\u000a\u000awe managed to make room for dessert - our friends shared a chocolate cake of some sort that looked terrifyingly rich, and my boyfriend and i made short work of the profiteroles (filled with luscious chocolate gelato).  \u000a\u000aeverything ranged from good to excellent, with the bright spots far more memorable than the low points.  service was good, the prices aren't too high, and the food is always a treat.  park bruges didn't bowl me over quite as thoroughly as point brugge, but i will undoubtedly be back to give them several more opportunities to try!\u000a\u000abut really....the macaroni and cheese.  you're crazy (or lactose intolerant?) if you don't order it.  nom.

Vi had lunch here yesterday, and holy crap did i love my grilled cheese sandwich.  despite being relatively simple, it was one of the best restaurant versions i've ever had.  the bread was wonderful (and stayed crisp the whole time!), the cheese was gooey and melty, and the oven-roasted tomatoes added a wonderful smokiness to the sandwich.  imagine the flavor of hearty marinara sauce without the actually messy sauce, and that's what these tomatoes were like.  and i got it with bacon, of course!  coleslaw on the side to lighten things up, and i was a happy camper.  i ate the whole thing, and since i generally have only a moderate appetite, i think that shows wise portion sizes on the part of park bruges.  the sandwich was $9 with bacon, i believe $8 without.\u000a\u000ai also got the "side salad" which was $7, and seemed expensive, but it was also enormous.  2 people could easily share this and each person's portion would still be larger than your usual "side salad."  i loved the sweet walnuts, and tangy cheese on top to keep the salad exciting.\u000a\u000aservice was a little slow, but our server was very friendly and brought us some bread and butter since we were so hungry.  they were busy, but not packed, at 1:15 on a saturday.  lunch is a great way to get a taste of this place for a smaller price - and they offer their macaroni and cheese at lunch too!  i wanted so badly to order it, but i was determined to try something new and i'm so glad i did.  i could eat one of those grilled cheese sandwiches every day.

Vthe best reason to go to park bruges is the mussels.  my friend had the one pound mussels and i got the mediterranean seafood stew.  both were prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  the service was excellent.  we wanted to stay and talk for a good while, and i like that our server did not try to hurry us in any way.  prices are reasonable.

V720 is a cool little place: it's name is a good indicator of what you'll find inside: a cafe area where they serve bob marley coffee among other mixed coffee and espresso and tea drinks. a little past that you'll start to see rows of records, with the most attention given to hip hop, then soul and jazz, and the oddly-placed indie hits(why the pains of being pure at heart s/t is in the funk section, i don't know if i'll ever understand). beyond that you'll see a selection of locally screen printed t-shirts, some pittsburgh related, some not, most of them are very cool. \u000a\u000a720 is interesting because it seems to be run in such a way that most people would want to run their business. take all of the things you like and put them together in one shop. you like vintage clothes? they just added a section for it this week. these guys can cook? they just added a monthly sunday brunch - which was awesome, totally vegetarian(totally vegan except for the omelettes) - for $13 all you care to eat every last sunday of the month.\u000a\u000athey may not be the best in all of the categories they try to compete in, but they love everything they do - meaning that it is all at least quality, and the small selection means that care goes into the things they choose to associate with their shop. it is definitely worth it to stop in, grab a coffee, listen to these guys dj some tunes and peruse the records while you just hang out and enjoy the environment.\u000a\u000aand i reiterate - try the brunch on the last sunday of every month, especially if you're vegetarian. the mix of asian and latin foods are refreshing.

Vit's all about the old fashions, martinis, and manhattans with the resurgence of '60s awesomeness (thank you, mad men!), and the bartenders at eclipse lounge are ready to shake and stir your world!\u000a\u000awe were here for a private party on saturday and really had a good time. there was a crowd, but it wasn't crowded. i agree with a previous review, that with their website and groupon, it was difficult to tell if you're supposed to primarily eat or drink here.  well, as of now at least, the answer is drink. they have a nice list of wines, beers and specialty cocktails supplied by personable bartenders who know their way around a shaker.  the ambiance is lounge-y but not sleazy, and the clientele follows suit. the dj was rocking some sweet old school hits like snoop & 90's jamz.\u000a\u000athe word on the street is that they're building a deck in the back for spring, and replacing the front facade with a large garage door thingy so that it can be open on nice days.\u000a\u000aps- if you're using your groupon, bring the paper version.

V300th review!  and i'm happy to bestow it on this charming little lounge on butler street.\u000a\u000ai came here on a saturday evening (around 630 pm) with several girlfriends, while we waited forever for a table at piccolo forno.  fyi, if you are looking for a place to wait for a table at pf, this is an outstanding choice.  not even a block away, super fun cocktails, and even some snacks if you feel like you can't wait 90 minutes before you get to your pasta.\u000a\u000athere weren't many other patrons when we arrived, but by the time we left around 8, the place was filling up.  seating is a bit awkward - there are lots of stools at the bar, and there are some loungey couches with small tables.  but there are only a few small stools that face the loungey couches, so if you come with a big group, it's hard to sit so you're all facing each other.  but the bartenders are more than willing to grab barstools and try to rearrange things to make you comfortable.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is trendy and fun, with a gorgeous new ceiling and some cool old-fashioned touches.  i loved the music they were playing, it was pretty random, but i remember some classic '80s selections and that always makes me happy.  the bartender was fun and casual with us, pulling up a stool to our table to take our order, and joking with us when he stepped out for a cig and left us in the place unattended for a minute.\u000a\u000ai ordered a zimlet (delicious and floral cocktail with st. germain elderflower liqueur), and then a french kiss (classic french martini).  they were strong, the martini glasses were full to the brim, and i was feeling good!  their cocktail menu was so fun, we tried a lot of drinks between the seven of us, and everyone was happy.  we also ordered a few appetizers from their food menu - almost everything on the menu is organic and they buy from local sources, so that was impressive.  we got spinach-feta hummus (which i believe came from the greek gourmet, but still it was delish) and then a cheese/fruit platter, which was simple (cubes of pretty regular cheese, drizzled with honey, served with wheat thins, grapes, and apples) but tasty if you like cheese (and who doesn't?)\u000a\u000aall in all it was a great place to wait for a table, and i think it'd be really fun to spend more time here, exploring the cocktail menu and drinking in the atmosphere.  definitely recommended!

Vthis is one of the nicer lounges i've been to in pittsburgh, and is non-smoking which is always a plus! i was also impressed with the quality of the mixed drinks which used ingredients such as fresh citrus squeezed right in front of me.

Vthe groupon gods were smiling upon me with this deal!  i got a massage, facial, and waxing last saturday.  making an appointment was super easy, and they'll e-mail you confirmation and a day-before reminder.  i hate talking on the phone, so this was a plus. it's located right across the street from casbah in a converted old house.  the interior has a modern, zen-ish feel, and the staff were professional, accommodating and nice. i started with the primal relaxation massage, which was a fantastic swedish massage.  the masseuse was skilled and friendly, and she worked her magic as i relaxed on their heated bed.  a white noise machine is used, and while it blocked out most of the s highland av noise, i could still hear the occasional motorcycle and siren. \u000anext was facial and waxing.  the waxing was efficient and not painful.  the seasonal organic facial was your typical facial: steam, cleansing, masque, extractions, moisturize.  my only complaint is that i still have some marks from a few of the extractions.\u000a\u000aa few tips: bring quarters for the parking meters & they allow you to tip on a credit card.

Vmy husband and i adore this place.  despite having been incredible fans of dozen (we had them cater our wedding brunches), we never went to their squirrel hill location.  but then we discovered waffalonia, and go pretty much once a week.  it is the perfect opportunity to go on a short walk and eat some absolutely delicious waffles.\u000a\u000ai actually don't mind the seating - i don't think the store owners really intend for the restaurant to be a place where you hang out indefinitely with your friends.  could it be that?  sure.  but by depriving you of proper seating options (which, btw, i can't say has ever bothered me... my husband and i hang out in there with no problems whatsoever) they make you focus on what's important, and that is how freaking delicious their offerings are.  my husband and i talk until we get the waffles, and then there's just silent munching and mooning over the waffles until they are all gone.  and then we start talking again, usually about how awesome the waffles are and how glad we are that there's a place like this in squirrel hill.\u000a\u000ajust as a funny side- note, for those of us who grew up in the 80s, try to think of the animaniacs song, but with waffalonia instead.

Vwaffalonia is a small shop, where the old dozen cupcakes used to be in squirrel hill, that serves up authentic liege waffles. the space is tiny, enough for a prep area, cash register, and two tiny breakfast bars to  eat inside on - which is interesting because i haven't really seen a good to-go method from here.\u000a\u000athe variety of simple selections is made complicated by the menu - naming waffles after various regions of beligum and associating toppings with them. to make things easy, you pick a waffle, and optionally spreads, ice cream, whipped cream, and fruit toppings. there is only one important option: speculoos, a sort of graham-cracker-butter imported right out of belgium. if a hearty smear of this on top of a warm fresh waffle doesn't turn your worst day around, you might need to see a psychiatrist.\u000a\u000athe ice cream comes from dave and andy's. i've had it once and, not being the biggest ice cream fan, thought the portion way too much - but people enjoy ice cream(you presumably would if you ordered it..) will probably rejoice over this. a plain waffle costs $3, and toppings are about $1, but an unlimited-topping waffle is $6, so prices stay very reasonable. also, be on the lookout for seasonal specials: the pumpkin waffle(with speculoos and pumpkin pie spread was out of this world).

Vif at anytime in this area of the city and someone says to me, "go to getgo."\u000a\u000amy response to them is going to be, "aw hell no!"\u000a\u000athis location is a nightmare to get into or out of.  cramped is an understatement.  if you park in one of the parking spots, forget about getting out for at least a half hour.  i just stopped to use their convenience store, wasn't very convenient.

Vi saw that this place had ramen, pork bun, and dumplings and was curious. \u000a\u000athere was plenty of dimly lit indoor seating but also outdoor seating facing the street. watch for the wasps! parking is available in the back.\u000a\u000aservice was great. i was checked on a few times. drinks and happy hour deals were available.\u000a\u000athe pork buns were decent and the bread was not not that thick. it was just enough to cover the ingredients.\u000a\u000ai ordered a veggie ramen but i might have been better with the pork-based soup. the noodles were not quite what i expected but for the location, i accept. perhaps it was the texture of the noodle.\u000a\u000athe pork and cabbage dumpling were tasty. they had offered a soy vinegar and  a sweet-and-sour sauce. the skin was thin and held together well.\u000a\u000ai wish i had room for the green tea crme brle. \u000a\u000avisa is accepted.

Vcash only\u000a\u000ayou'd never find this place if you weren't looking for it - a tiny little diner near the hospital. their hours are somewhat erratic, i believe they're closed fridays and only open until 1 on saturday. upon entering you're greeted with a prominent view of the kitchen(one guy cooking on what appears to be a standard stove), a breakfast bar that seats about 15, and about 10 tables that could seat 2-4.  we sat ourselves at one of the few open tables, the people inside were a few senior couples, one lone older man at the counter, and a young couple. just about everyone seemed to be a regular and know each other by name. \u000a\u000atheir menu lists breakfast and lunch, with most of their 'a la carte' breakfast items being a few bucks each, and their breakfast plates being about $5. i got an egg sandwich with homefries and coffee for $5, my girlfriend got 2 eggs with toast, homefries, and juice for $6. my girlfriend asked if instead of meat she could get cheese and the eggs scrambled. when the waitress took the order back the guy behind the counter started at the slip in a "what the hell?" kind of way but didn't complain.\u000a\u000aour food arrived in less than 5 minutes, a large plate which had a sizable amount of food on it considering the price, and very few frills. our coffee was kept full and our order was correct, no items having been forgotten. none of the food was notably good, but it was all tasty and had a "homecooked"("rustic"?) feel to it. also, bonus points that the eggs and homefries we were served were not dripping in industrial butter-like oil.\u000a\u000aa point worth noting is that while our waitress was very nice to us, it appears they are happy to tell it to you like it is, telling and older man who seemed to be a regular after quite a bit of chit-chat that if he couldn't finish his meal by 1pm then he ought to not bother ordering.  \u000a\u000afor $11 and a tip we got a  2 decently sized breakfasts, juice, coffee, and extremely quick service. $6 is about as expensive as anything in there is, so i'm sure we'll be in here on many weekend mornings in the future.

Vwhen at the rivers, we find ourselves coming here more than the buffet. wheel house is open later, be careful though, after 11p they have a "lat night" menu which doesn't encompass some of wh best dishes.\u000a\u000afor starters, jb and i order the spinach artichoke dip which is divine! yeah, yeah, been there done that some of you may think, but this is some of the best stuff ever put on a salty, crisp tortilla chip. huge chunks of artichoke, creamy cheese and velvety spinach baked to bubbly perfection.\u000a\u000aas an entree, i usually get the cheese quesadilla which can be hit or miss. sometimes the pico inside is all clumped together in the ends of the wedges, leaving the outside edges dry with no filler. other times, it's perfectly scattered throughout. quesadillas come with sour cream and guacamole, you can't screw up sour cream but the guac is just a bland, pasty green glop of who knows what. j usually gets some type of burger with the trio of fries (waffle, russet, sweet if memory serves me right) the fires are tasty and j is never disappointed with his burger though his "medium rare" tends to come out differently each time, he has never sent it back.\u000a\u000aservice is also hit or miss, i guess it depends on day of the week and time of visit. large screens make wh ideal for catching up on all the march madness or ufc fights while satisfying your cravings.

Vthis review, if done a few years ago, could have gone a different direction.  but with the remake of market square i'm happy to be giving it a five star rating.\u000a\u000ano more chopped up areas for sitting and no more street cutting right through the middle of the plaza.  market square is a great place to be able to take a little escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.  with all the restaurants that line the plaza you can definitely have an outside meal at one of the many table that are available to sit at.  \u000a\u000athis place is great for events too.  most people know of the st. patrick day's festivities, but almost always there is something to do here.  from christmas to first night.  i even had the chance to attend a wedding in market square.  talk about amazing.  the city surrounding you and you make the day that much more special.

Vi was all set to love this place because of the great concept.  the food was very good and reasonably priced.  but the music was way too loud, it was difficult to have a good conversation.\u000a\u000ai enjoyed sitting on the patio deck, and the huge ceiling fan was fun.  i just wish there was some place to sit and talk without the loud music.  local bar and kitchen tries very hard to be trendy and the people watching is fun, just not sure it's a good fit for me.

Vmy sister and  i met up for dinner here, i was so fixated on finding a place my picky little sis would eat that i forgot to take into account rush hour traffic and finding  place in the south side to park.\u000a\u000aonce kj got there, we ordered warm nachos with a balsamic reduction, blue cheese crumbles and scallions. i knew i would love the dish and to my surprise, so did my sister. for entrees, kj ordered the philly served on a pretzel bun and i opted for the roasted red pepper panini, both sandwiches came on fresh, chewy bread that held their contents well.\u000a\u000ai came during the week around 6pm so it wasn't that busy inside, but i can definitely see it getting packed on the weekends and late night

Vthis place rocks!  from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food, everything about this place rocks!\u000a\u000ai enjoyed everything about this place.  there are probably a lot of factors as to why i enjoyed it so much, so we should get to them.\u000a\u000a1.  the timing: maybe the time that we showed up here had a factor in this.  i showed up in the afternoon, guess you could call it lunner or dunch.  you know that time between lunch and dinner that no one really seems to care to go to a restaurant, but should.  no wait time at the hostess desk, no wait when we sat down, no wait...like at all.\u000a\u000a2.  the seating: you have the option to sit either indoors or semi-outdoors.  when i say semi-outdoors i mean they have the ability to open up the front of the place so it is basically a sidewalk cafe at that point.  also they have rooftop seating as well that has this canopy mesh type of covering.  we chose that option and were quite happy with the warm breeze that blew through while we ate.\u000a\u000a3.  the drinks: i have to say that a yinzerita sounds good just about any day.  and when you have the option to use any bottled beer they have on their list to make yours, that makes it even better.\u000a\u000a4.  the fried pickles: honestly, some of thee best i have ever had.  pairing it with their dipping sauce that they make in house was correct.  i liked it so much that i actually asked if i could take some of it home.  there were hints of cayenne and chili powder.  spicy, but not too spicy.\u000a\u000a5.  the side options: i implore you to take advantage of the sweet potato fries.  to say they are delicious is an understatement.  fresh cut and topped with a touch of salt and some cinnamon.  that was quite the mixture of salty and sweet.  \u000a\u000a6.  the burger: i chose the mexican war street.  an interesting blend to put on a burger.  i love when you mix a little mexican into a traditional american burger.  guacamole and pico de gallo on top of one of the biggest burgers i have had was also correct.  mix in some pepper jack cheese to complete a pittsburgh themed masterpiece.  the flavors mixed together so well that there is no need to ever ask for any type of condiments.  \u000a\u000a7.  the service: i have to say this is the cherry on top of this experience.  everyone is just so friendly.  as it wasn't rushed or crowded in here, we were able to get a chance to chat with our server.  she was quite hilarious and knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.

Vfree chips, pretty cheap, right next to brillobox, and open until 3am friday and saturday(tacos and burritos only)? how could you not love this place? the food is decent, my friend raved about his pork, but my pittsburgh burrito with veggies instead of meat was a bit dry - but with the combination of food how could it not be. some tapatio fixed the problem. also, fries and tartar sauce, a "pittsburgh" burrito does not make. the place claims to be so-cal mexican food, and indeed the waitress's truck had a california plate on it - so they seem to be doing alright. \u000a\u000athey also have carne asada fries, which was something i thought was cool on the west coast that i hadn't seen here. my girlfriend coerced a meatless version off of the late-night menu which was really delicious - if they fix the sacrilegious pittsburgh burrito and  the yinzers ever find out about nacho fries then los cabos will be the mexican primanti's in no time... in the best way possible

Vi really wanted to like this place, and at first i was very hopeful. the decor is reminiscent of taquerias out west, and the service was friendly and prompt. still, i mostly rate a place on the quality of the food and it was decidedly subpar. i tried three different tacos here: chicken, pulled chicken, and carnitas. they were all certainly edible, but the tortillas ruined the experience - they were tough and greasy.\u000a\u000aon the plus side, the complementary chips and salsa were decent although the salsa wasn't very hot.\u000a\u000aif i try this place again, i will probably avoid the tacos and try something else.

V2.5 rounding up\u000a\u000amy dinner companion and i went for some take out, he ordered the chili rellano burrito which is exactly what i wanted to order. when i said "make that two", my friend suggested we just shared. okay, i  thought. i  have a pretty  healthy appetite so i ordered a side of chips and salsa. when we got back to his place and started to eat, i noticed that the chips were greasy and stale and the burrito was swimming in sauce, making the tortilla a soggy mess. i was hesitant to try it, but i did and it was pretty damn good. \u000a\u000athe burrito was indeed big enough to feed the both of us and the excess sauce went great with the chips.\u000a\u000aif i were in the area and craving mex, i would possibly go back, but i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

Vthis place is weird because when you walk up, it's a bright yellow building with mexican decor and music playing...then you walk inside, and it's an old ruby tuesday's or something.  the tvs were all playing univision...guess that counts for some authenticity points!\u000a\u000athe service was friendly and quick.  chips and salsa are free (and unlimited), but that was my favorite part of the meal.  the food is okay but rather bland, and required a dousing of the four kinds of hot sauce set out on the table.\u000a\u000ai would come back with friends for drinks (and chips and salsa), but that's it.  although it's not saying much, there are better mexican places in the 'burgh.

Vi'm sorry, but i liked this place.  maybe it's because i came here to drink, not eat.  that's what a bar is for, at least it is to me.  if you wanted food, maybe you should have stayed downstairs, jus' sayin'.\u000a\u000athis is a great little place up in here.  yes, i do mean up in here, you need to go upstairs, hence the name.  to me, it seems to be a perfect space for a bar, and they used the space the best they could.  the bar is perfect, enough seats for any bar dweller that enters.  a couple of high tops complete that area.  a few steps (up, that is) to the left as you enter is another area for seating, this area also houses the two dart boards.\u000a\u000awhen i was here, the place was kind of dead, perfect for a low key night when all you want to do is get a drink and stare at whatever they chose to be on the tv.  the bartender was polite and on top of her game.  she never missed a beat when a patron asked for a drink.  i also found that the other bar goers were just as nice as someone you bump into on the street.  ironically my friend and i struck up a conversation with two people we bumped into outside.  there appears to be no judgments being made here.\u000a\u000adrink specials every night of the week, and they are open every night of the week.  credit cards accepted.  six packs to go.  and the most awesome thing to me, they will put together a 'mystery craft sixer' for you to take for an extremely reasonable price.

Vmaybe it was the night i was here and maybe it was the fact that i attended an event that guaranteed us a place to sit for the entire night, but i had an amazing time while here.\u000a\u000awe held a friends birthday here and had bottle service.  even though we had bottle service, we were not ignored by the waitress.  she made sure to check on us to see if we wanted anything besides what we already had.  they supplied a cake for us for the celebration (no food from outside is allowed in).\u000a\u000athe music was amazing as well, a dj was on hand playing some good mixes of music that kept the place jumping.  people were everywhere!\u000a\u000awhy can't i give drum bar five stars?  last call was at 1...yes, 1 in the morning.  oh and the prices can be a bit steep.

Vmy new favorite chain sub place in the burgh!\u000a\u000ai was in the area one night and had my heart set on finally trying a burger from winghart's. they were closed for remodeling due to a fire. so i walk into dibella's and boy am i glad i did! when i walked in i noticed how clean the space was and that it had a old school feel to it.\u000a\u000adibella's not only offers subs but, salads, macaroni, potato and pasta salads, deli pickles and cookies as well. think of five guy's but, with hoagies as you pick your bread, size of hoagie, cheese and toppings you want. i went up to the counter, looked over the menu and was ready to order. i went with a cheesesteak on their white bread, (similar to pretzel bread) provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, banana and sweet peppers, mayo, bbq sauce and steak sauce. \u000a\u000ai got my sub toasted so the provolone could melt a little more. i added a combo of chips and a drink also. i grabbed my bag of chips, went over and filled my cup and went down to the cash register to pay. the smell of my sub being made was absolutely intoxicating! a few minutes i sat down to enjoy my hoagie. let me tell you, it was epic! from the fresh bread to the tender steak to the fresh condiments, it was truly one of the best chain store subs i've ever had! it was so good that a few days later i took my wife and daughter to get a sub as well. they also have a kids menu. service was excellent as well as it was a little crowded but i got my sub fast!\u000a\u000aall in all a great place that is a defiant must try!

Vcan i just say the obvious here?  it's subway, on steroids.\u000a\u000aeverything is just about as similar as you can get. from how you order to how you pay. however, the most glaring difference here is the price. when i went to pay i about hit the floor. for their "medium" sub meal combo i could have had two foot longs at subway.\u000a\u000athe thing that i did fall in love with here was the bread. i know the other place bakes theirs fresh as well, but it does not compare to this.  the crust kind of crumbles when you bite into it, and the innards are so soft and great at keeping what's inside, inside.  and do they ever load up what's on the inside, i'm not talking about the fillers. i'm talking about the actually meat.  i tasted more meat than veggie, which pleased me.\u000a\u000athe one thing that i didn't really like was not being able to see the toppings. it's great that they interact with you, but it's also hard to hear over everyone else that is in the restaurant.  plus i like to see that what is put on the sub is as fresh as the bread.\u000a\u000ain summation, even though the price shocked me, the taste out shocked me. is that a phrase?  oh well if it isn't, i'm using it.

Vit's taken me a year to find out that the bfg cafe wasn't named after a weapon in doom, and that it therefore wasn't some sort of internet cafe as i had expected. no, in fact, bfg cafe stands for big fat greek cafe, presumably because if you eat here regularly you will be big and fat, and the fact that they serve gyros. additionally, bfg stands for bloomfield-friendship-garfield, the three nearest neighborhoods to the cafe(well actually east liberty is probably closer than bloomfield but nobody wants to eat at the enormous large fat greek cafe, it's simply too verbose).\u000a\u000awalking in to the cafe is a big open kitchen, well over half the room, a few vending machines for drinks, and a seating area to the side. seating is actually plentiful here as it appears the cafe is two spaces combined. the food here is my favorite kind: cheap. the most expensive item on their menu is a large speciality pizza for $13. 9" hoagies and gyro sandwiches are $5 and under, fries are about a buck, and "pittsburgh-style" salads and 12" pizzas are about $5-7. simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that i didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax. \u000a\u000athe gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other big fat greek champion(my big fat greek gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  the pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. toppings weren't skimped on, but i had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice i did attempt. they also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, i did too.\u000a\u000ashockingly, bfg didn't replace salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while i'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when i don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhood

Va mile or so long trail along the mon that goes from no place to nowhere via nothing.  it is a rails-to-trails conversion and it runs along a roadbed once used for shuttling coal between the rail line and barges.  its parking lot on the eastern end was once a transfer point between the river and the slag dumps on nine mile run.  the trail ends abruptly on the western end at the csx railway.  some people trespass along the rail line with their bikes.  don't do this because this is a very heavily used freight rail line.  it's also illegal and my husband the train enthusiast has said the train crews will radio the police to report tresspassers.\u000a\u000aa couple of interesting points too.  this trail is is a "paper street" long owned by the city but never developed before.  the community of duck hollow is very isolated from the rest of the city and if you go just a little bit east of the trailhead along old browns hill road, you'll cross a one lane bridge and at the intersection of old browns hill road and mcfarren street (i believe) you'll see one of the old pittsburgh street signs.\u000a\u000aduck hollow trail is a pleasant trail but there's not much to it.  eventually it may link with other trails as part of the great allegheny passage.  i went on this trail once and even though i live nearby in squirrel hill, i didn't think it was worth the effort.

Vi've noticed this place while driving to the south side via greenfield ave. one evening the boyfriend and i were looking for a bite to eat but neither of could decide where to go. on a whim, i pulled up to szmidt's and man, i'm glad i did! \u000a\u000athe aroma of all the spices and fresh bread when you walk in the door is intensely pleasing. the deli case is filled with various fresh pasta salads and sides that include grape leaves, pickled cucumber slices, mac 'n cheese with jalapeno, apricot glazed meatloaf, potato salad, tuna salad, haluski (looked amazing, i will definitely be back to try it), and various other items that evade my memory at the moment. \u000a\u000ahave i mentioned that everything is made in-house? breads, salads, sides, and pierogies - all home made! \u000a\u000aspeaking of pierogies...all your classics are here - potato & cheddar, potato & kraut, potato & jalapeno, sausage, and plain kraut ($4.95/6 $8.95/12). in addition to these are "new world pierogies" ($5.45/6 $9.95/12) - reuben, thanksgiving with turkey gravy, southwest chicken with cilantro lime sour cream, buffalo chicken with bleu cheese, cheese steak with horseradish sour cream, and bacon cheeseburger with rage sauce. they also offer sweet pierogies like apple mango, granny smith apple pie, and a seasonal special. \u000a\u000aso much deliciousness in one place, we didn't know where to begin. after thinking long and hard, i finally decided on a spinach & feta doughbie (think stromboli) and justin opted for the frankie (sliced turkey breast, ginger mustard glazed ham, maplewood bacon, american cheese, mayo, lettuce, and tomato all on a toasted homemade bun. \u000a\u000awhile our food was being prepared, we chatted with the owner. i told him we've been living here for a year now and can't believe we never heard of his place then he informed us that they just opened up a month ago and offered us some samples from the deli case. we had a little scoop of potato salad (better than my mom's - sorry ma), 4 grape leaves (the best i've had and i do love me some dolmas), sweet cucumber slices (jb was a huge fan and now wants me to try my hand at recreating them at home so he can have them all the time) and ziti pasta salad (which is great with the cuke slices)!! everything we had was exquisite!! \u000a\u000athe entire experience was pleasurable - the shop owner was personable and inviting, the shop is darling and homey with pictures of the family hung on the walls and the food is delectable and very affordable. \u000a\u000asorry for such a lengthy review but i just can't say enough good things about szmidt's. \u000a\u000aif you happen to find yourself in the greenfield/squirrel hill area do yourself a favor and give this place a chance!!!

Vszmidts is another one of those places i remember from the old neighborhood.  it's in a little unassuming, "blink-and-you-miss-it-hole-in-the-wall" storefront.  it's so small that i believe it doesn't even have a proper sign out front--just a sandwich board advertising the daily specials.  \u000a\u000aah, but their sandwiches are terrific here.  they use their own house brined pastrami and corned beef (yum!).  and their pierogies are amazing!  you can choose between old world pierogies (potato & cheddar, potato & kraut--my favorite, potato & jalepeno, sausage, or kraut) and new world pierogies (rueben, thanksgiving with turkey gravy, buffalo chicken, cheese steak, and bacon cheeseburger).  \u000a\u000awant something sweet instead?  try the granny smith apple pie pierogie.  m-m-m-m, all that sugary, carby goodness!

Va scoop of cookies and cream with a scoop of confetti hit the spot on a 75 degree summer evening!  oh man was it good.  i like it when my ice cream actually tastes like something other than opaque ice, and this did for sure!  i wasn't quite sure what the confetti was going to be flavored like when i ordered it, thinking maybe cake batter but it looked good so i got it anyway, and after about 3 bites i could tell it was flavored like that confetti cake mix (or is that stuff flavored after something even else?)!   flavor!  i want to go back a million more times to try them all!

Vvery cute place with tons of flavors - everything looks yummy and it's almost impossible to make a decision.  the mint chocolate chunk was yummy.  the raspberry truffle was not as good - not much raspberry flavor and the truffles didn't have that distinct truffley texture.  also, a medium is pretty big - even for me, a big girl with a big appetite and a major sweet tooth.  it may be because the density is higher than ice cream.  if you stick to a small, it's affordable.  (there is a $5 credit card minimum.)  it will be crowded on weekend nights because of the traffic for girasole, but during the day on a sunday it was practically empty.  there's a nice bench across the street to enjoy your treats and people-watch.\u000a\u000ai will definitely keep returning to try as many flavors as my food allergies will allow.

Vafter recently discovering the joys of gelato on a trip to seattle, i was eager to find a decent place in the burgh. mulberry creamery not only stands up to the seattle establishments, it beats them in terms of flavor variety and waffle cone tastiness! more flavors than you can shake a stick at? check.

Vi saw the sign for this delightful gelato shop after dinner one night and rushed in (even though my pasta fish dish was enough to feed 3!). i was glad i did. i caught them during the end of the day but the friendly staff was still glad to serve me. \u000a\u000ai sample of everything, i shouted. a few of their daily flavors include: butter pecan (no sugar added),  banana strawberry swirl, blueberry muffin, chocolate marshmallow, coconut cream pie, cookies n cream, dark chocolate stracciatella, death by chocolate, fior di latte, gianduia, hazelnut, key lime, lemon sorbetto, mango, mint chocolate chunk, mulberry cream w/ chocolate chunks, peanut butter cup, pistachio, raspberry & truffles, strawberry cheesecake, tiramisu, vanilla custard, dulce de leche, birthday cake, and caramel latte --- but that's not all! there is another listing of rotating flavors for you to enjoy!

Vi've been going to mercurio's for several years now, but their new location on walnut is definitely an improvement on the old. they still have the same excellent gelato flavors and waffle cones, but now offer a full array of lunch and dinner options in addition to wine and beer. all the food i've had here has been excellent, but i especially like their wood-fired pizzas and salads. this is now near the top of my list for italian food in the area, and makes a wonderful spot for both lunch and dinner.

Vsome of the best pizza and gelato in pittsburgh!\u000a\u000ai never knew about this place before our yelp elite event. all the food was so good during the event that i've gone back quite a few times since. \u000a\u000athey offer amazing neapolitan style pizza, salads and gelato. our favorite pizzas are the pizza del re (house made mozzarella, truffle spread, mushrooms, prosciutto di parma, extra virgin olive oil) and the quattro formaggi (mozzarella di bufala, fontina, parmigiano, provolone, extra virgin olive oil)\u000a\u000athe space is small so a lot of times there will be a wait, especially on the weekends so use the no wait app. also be sure to download the free loyal tree app for your smart phone to get a free gelato when you join the mercurio's loyalty program. you'll even earn points with each visit and be rewarded with cash back to spend at mercurio's.\u000a\u000athe gelato is just as good as the pizza. my favorites are the vanilla custard, dulce de leche and strawberry cheesecake. thank god for my waistline that this place didn't exist when i lived in shadyside! \u000a\u000aservice is always great as well.

Vamusement park season will be upon us soon folks, and considering the crummy weather we've had, i'm itching to get out to kennywood and do some serious coaster riding.  it's an annual rite of spring for me to go to kennywood on opening day and be among the first to ride the phantom's revenge.  i am that much of a coaster geek that i would push my own mother out of the way in order to be among the first riders.  \u000a\u000aso for all you newbies, what's the phantom like?  \u000a\u000awell let's take a ride!  in fact, let's take two!  we'll sit in front for the view on our first ride and on our second ride, we'll sit in back for the g-forces.  the view and g-forces on this ride are simply like nothing you've ever experienced.  are we seated comfortably, loose articles secured, and our lap bars in position?  okay, here we go into our roll towards the lift hill!  is your heart pounding in anticipation as the lift chain engages and we begin our ascent?  good!  \u000a\u000ahave patience 'cos it's a slow climb as the lift chain rattles.  we can see nothing but blue skies and clouds as we ascend.  finally we crest the lift hill as the chain disengages and for a second we can see the horizon before we do our 160 foot drop into a graceful swooping curve.  whoa!   as we bottom out we begin hurtling towards that second hill.  see how that second hill doesn't look so high?  ahhh, but what you uninitiated types don't see coming....\u000a\u000a....is the phantom's signature second drop, a 228 foot plunge down the ravine and through the thunderbolt's structure.  that's right!  unlike most coasters, the phantom's big drop is not the first, but the second.  which also means that unlike most coasters, you're already going at almost full speed when you hit the big drop.  the phantom has been clocked at 82 mph when it hits the bottom!  \u000a\u000athen we go back uphill into a sweeping fan turn and then into a reverse curve, diving thru the thunderbolt's structure a second time before doing a couple of series of airtime bunny hops.  finally we do the brakerun and we can breathe again!  hoo boy!  your stomach caught up with you yet?  great!  let's ride again!\u000a\u000athe phantom's revenge was orignally built in 1991 as a multi-element looper, the steel phantom.  behind cedar point's magnum xl, it was one of the first hypercoasters built.  a decade later, with kennywood needing a new attraction and having limited space to build one, the decision was made to refashion the phantom.  it was converted to a terrain/ravine coaster, eliminating the loops while retaining the station, lift, and the first two drops.  \u000a\u000aunfortunately, the phantom's revenge has always labored in the shadow of its more famous cousin, the magnum xl.  but as far as i'm concerned, the phantom has always been the far superior ride.

Vif revenge is suppose to make your stomach drop and giggle like a school girl, then i'm loving the phantom's revenge.  \u000a\u000ayou're firmly strapped in and you start your assent.  you're sense of security is shortly lived because that's when the revenge starts.  plunging you down a hill, back up and then back down.  whipping you back and forth and abruptly coming to a stop.\u000a\u000athat's when you finally realize the revenge was sweet.  tears streaming down your face, drool out of the corner of your mouth...pure love there from the speed.\u000a\u000ayou shouldn't go back after revenge has been served, but it's so hard to resist.

Vah there's nothing like a rough ride on a good woodie!\u000a\u000ai'm talking rollercoasters here folks!  a "woodie" is slang for a wooden coaster.   despite the fact that my ultimate favorite , the phantom's revenge, is a steel coaster, i actually prefer woodies.  steel coasters may give you a quiet, smooth ride.  but for me, i love the bone-rattling, rough-riding, wheel-squealing effects of a great wooden coaster.   no it's not a hometown call here o' fellow coaster geeks.  the thunderbolt is the best one out there.  \u000a\u000awhat makes the thunderbolt so great?  well for starters, parts of it are old.  it was originally built in 1924 and was known as the pippen.  a 1968 remodeling of the ride by andy e. vettel expanded the ride, adding helix hills and four drops down a ravine.  the thundebolt is essentially an out-n-back coaster with elements of a ravine/terrain coaster.  what makes this coaster so unique is that you don't go up the lift hill immediately out of the station.  this coaster takes such good advantage of its terrain that it drops immediately upon departure and the lift hill is in the middle.\u000a\u000aoh, and because of the design of the seats and because of the fact that the ride is so rough, you cannot ride alone.  you absolutely have to have a partner, even in the unlikely event that there are other empty seats on the train!  riding by yourself or the odd person out in your group?  they'll find a partner for you.  \u000a\u000aready to take a ride?  \u000a\u000aokay, comfortable?  any loose items secured?  here we go.  we immediately do a drop out of the station, under the phantom's revenge.  we then go back up, take a right turn, and then hit the lift hill.  clack, clack, clack, clack--hear that lift chain?  okay, we're at the top, the chain has disengaged, another right turn, and into the thunderbolt's famous bowl we go.  we gonna take a spin around here twice, then a left jog, and another drop under the phantom.  wheels squealing now, we make another righ towards the big finish--the tallest drop on the ride before hitting the brake run and back into the station.\u000a\u000aas we exit the ride, have your insides caught up yet?  have you stopped jittering?  now you know why we had to partner up!  that thing really tosses us around in our seat!  and though the thunderbolt may not be the tallest woodie out there, it throws its hills and turns at you fast-n-furiously!\u000a\u000aawesome ride and it's an ace (american coasters enthusiasts) classic award recipient.

V3.5 stars. \u000a\u000athe sky rocket is kennywood's newest (2010) rollercoaster. unlike most coasters which use a traditional chain and lift hill, the sky rocket is a launch coaster. kennywood previously had a launch coaster, the laser loop, which used a catapult-like hydraulic launch. unlike the laser loop, the sky rocket uses a synchronized magnetic induction to launch its trains up to full speed. \u000a\u000athe ride begins by leaving the station, making a u turn, and then launching itself down a straightaway, shooting straight up a top hat tower, lingering for a nanosecond, and freefalling 90 degrees down the other side. it then goes into an inverted top hat, then some corkscrews, another drop, a barrel roll, then a few wave turns and finally some bunny hops. \u000a\u000adesigning the sky rocket presented kennywood with a few unique problems. kennywood needed a new ride, but had very limited space in which to build one. it shows what you can accomplish when you don't have a lot of room. unfortunately, it also shows what you have to do when you don't have a lot of room. the duration of the ride is very short--a little over a minute long. \u000a\u000athe sky rocket also has another problem, about 200 miles to the northwest in sandusky, oh. cedar point also has a launch coaster, the maverick. unfortunately, everything the sky rocket does, the maverick does better. for example, whereas the sky rocket launches on a straightaway, the maverick launches up hill. the sky rocket launches once; the maverick has a second launch inside a tunnel. \u000a\u000astill, to judge the sky rocket on its own merits, its a fun ride. worth checking out if you're at kennywood.

Vi was excited to finally get to ride the "new" coaster.  so much i didn't mind waiting in the long line for it.\u000a\u000ai'm not going to use any terms that the previous reviewer used because i have no idea what they are talking about.  all i need to know is that you go fast, up a hill and around a bend.  and to write about another amusement park during a post for beloved kennywood, i will not do.  forget about other places when you read this.  know that kennywood has an amazing new, fast, reliable roller coaster.  yes, the duration of the ride is short, but it is well worth it.  \u000a\u000ai firmly believe you can gage how good a roller coaster is going to be by the size of the line you have to wait in.  therefore this is a 4 out of 5 stars.

Vto clear up any confusion, the new name is sichuan gourmet.  the restaurant was losing too much business to another china star on murray ave in greenfield. sichuan gourmet is authentic sichuan.  this is the food that the chinese g20 delegation ate when they were in pittsburgh.  the food is wonderful, and the service is very attentive.  i like this new location, and it looks like they will thrive in squirrel hill.  the tan tan noodles are a great appetizer to start with.  i like the flaming pan dishes.

Vhallelujah!  an authentic chinese restaurant smack in the middle of squirrel hill!\u000a\u000ain my three years in pittsburgh so far, i'm often asked, "how do you like pittsburgh?"  and my answer is always, "it's exceeded my expectations!" and i mean that in the best way possible.  but then i always have to temper my enthusiasm with the fact that there is absolutely no reasonable chinese fare to be had (that, and i miss being around tons of asian americans).  anyway, i used to pass by this place and think, "if they do dim sum and japanese food and whatever else kind of asian food they think they cook, they must do everything poorly."  apparently that wasn't so far off.\u000a\u000abut a few months ago, i noticed that the signage had changed, and that when i looked in the windows, the place was full of chinese people!  and that, my friends, is the mark of a good chinese restaurant.  i'm sad to admit that i waited this long to try it, since i live just a few blocks away, but man oh man, am i glad i did.\u000a\u000athis is the real deal, sichuan spicy goodness.  we got the lo mein (don't shoot me, it was for my non-chinese husband), garlic eggplant, and fish fillets in hot pepper sauce/broth (literal translation from chinese: water cooked fish).  oh my god awesome. \u000a\u000ai can't wait to try some of the other goodies they serve here.  but make no mistake - come here for excellent chinese food.  thank the heavens above, pittsburgh culinary options really have come along!

Vi've never really had authentic chinese food, and i'm as guilty as they come as far as loving my americanized general tso's and egg rolls. however, authentic sichuan, with it's allure of numbing spiciness, has had me wanting to try it out for a while now. so while we waited for our one-hour photos to finish at costco, we ran up here to give this place a shot.\u000a\u000awe walked in to grab takeout and the guy at the front desk seemed american born and fluent in both english and mandarin(not that i know what fluent mandarin sounds like, mind you), so consider your complicated phone orders a-ok with this place. we started to look at the menu and were disappointed at the choices - it seemed to be a normal chinese place with a few additions here and there. as i was about to choose a dish, though, the guy mentions that there are in fact two different menus, and that if we're feeling adventurous we should look off the black menu. \u000a\u000aof course, this is what i had been looking for - and of course it was no easier to make a selection off the hundred or so brief descriptions. i finally asked the guy what would give me my fix of sichuan heat and he immediately recommended the chongqing chicken($12.95), describing it at simply chicken mixed in with a heaping pile of peppers, sounded right up my alley. my friend got shredded potato in a spicy sauce($9.95), and my girlfriend got tofu noodle soup($7.95) - which they accommodated her complicated order of no sesame oil, sesame seeds, or nuts by going back to the kitchen and ensuring it could be done first. our food was ready in about 10 minutes.\u000a\u000awhen i finally got around to eating the chicken, it was exactly as i had hoped - peppers outnumbered chicken in this dish by far, and the heat was amazing. pure mouth-numbing bliss, and the flavors of the dish itself were outstanding. but seriously, the heat was what i was after and the heat i got, and as i took breaks from eating i was sweating and my tongue felt like it got shot up with novocain.\u000a\u000athe shredded potato dish was fairly tasty for the little i tried, and the tofu noodle soup was a bit bland in my opinion - by we also ordered it with a water base instead of a chicken-stock base, which is probably the reason. \u000a\u000athe china star is an awesome place to go try out some real chinese food. i don't know if this place will replace my general tso's habits, but i can't wait to come back and start to work my way through some more items on this menu.

Vmost of you guys know that i'm a how lee devotee, but upon the insistence of jarrett h, i finally tried china star (now known as sichuan gourmet).  jarrett-- thank you!! the food here is fresh and delicious, and they use less oil than how lee. now, don't get me wrong, i still heart how lee, but it's nice to be able to mix it up a little bit. i've had the frogs legs & multiple noodle dishes: all good. i'm not a fan of some offerings (dumplings, spring roll, and crab rangoon), and ordering over the phone can be exacerbating. i've also had to convince them that, despite being white, i'm ok with bone-in meat, spice and "weird" meats. once convinced, the employees seem to be genuinely enthusiastic  that i'm trying more traditional chinese dishes. (ethnic food places not believing me about spice level and meat choice is another topic and tangent i shall not engage here.) \u000a  all in all, though, i'm happy to have another delicious chinese restaurant in my rotation, and can't wait to actually dine in there rather than carryout or delivery.

Vthis is an amazing place to have tucked away in one of the smallest neighborhoods in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000ai went in with nothing on my mind to buy, just to browse.  after a few minutes of being in here i of course found several items that piqued my interest.  i browsed the shelves just to familiarize myself to what was in stock.  so much to look through, so little time i had to do it.  after going up and down the few aisles they have, i found myself by the cat items and noticed something i wanted.  i was distraught at first thinking they only had it for cats and not dogs.  luckily an employee was nearby and informed me that they do indeed have what i wanted for dogs, just not where i was looking.  she took me to where this item was, actually several different varieties of the item and the only difficulty i had was choosing the one i thought my little man would enjoy more.\u000a\u000aawesome thing about this place is that they have a shop cat that roams about and is so friendly.  i went to pay and the cat jumped up on the counter and greeted me.  \u000a\u000athey also had two chickens that you can view from both inside and outside the store since they were in one of the window areas.  \u000a\u000aanother amazing thing this place does, and it may not be all the time, is find displaced animals homes.  my recent trip showed that they had a bunny, whose owner was deployed for the military, was in need of a home.  if i could, i'd give this place more than five stars.

Vonly one review? i thought this place was pretty popular. regardless, i came out for the live band 'punk' karaoke. once a month, howlers is host to a band which plays about(just over, and increasing monthly) 100 songs. write your name on the whiteboard and they'll call you up and play your pick, provide backup vocals, and your own goofy stage banter. you just have to stand there and do anything from get stage-fright to rip your shirt off and roll around on the floor singing. i put punk in quotes, because you shouldn't expect to come here and listen to the ramones and germs all night - they have a fairly loose definition of what punk is including pixies, devo, the violent femmes and more.(to be fair they do in fact advertise the new wave part).\u000a\u000ai knew prior to going that there was a $3 cover, so i headed in prepared at around 11pm(there are nightly 9-11pm specials as well - $2 yuengling bottles that night) and i could hear mission of burma being sung through the outside window. walking in, you can tell that they allow smoking, and people were indeed smoking, but for as much as there was my girlfriend and i really didn't notice it while we were there. maybe they have good ventilation. there was nobody at the door to take our cover, so we walked right on in and ordered beers. they have east end on draft, two of those ran me $11. the bar is split up into two sections - the bar and the 'stage' area. you can watch the stage area on tvs in the bar, and the sound is surprisingly isolated.\u000a\u000awe walked to the stage area which is where they took our cover - sneaky, but i like that. you can still come here without paying if you don't want to, just stay in the bar. also, the first 40 or so people get a token(coaster) for a free domestic or well drink at the bar - which we got(and later traded for tall pbrs) - so that made everything totally worth it. we sat to watch the karaoke, each table has a one-page list of songs that you pick from. if you want to go, write your name on the board and they'll call you up when its your turn (ie no dj to pocket-veto your request). next to the stage, a line-up of $1 seagrams shots.\u000a\u000ai have to say, it was a ton of fun, and i didn't even get drunk and sing(although i wanted to sing, since there were definitely a few i knew by heart. [i got a.. i got a broken face, uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh ooh]). the list of songs is short and hand-selected, translation: you know what you're going to get. for me, it's perfect, i love this kind of music, and i don't have to worry about hearing an awful interpretation of adele(and hell, punk music is meant to be sung poorly anyways). the band is quite good, and a lot of the singers were great too, everyone had a sense of humor and some got really into it.\u000a\u000aagain, i didn't really notice the smoke even though people were definitely smoking. however when i got home my clothes had definitely become casualties. the place probably wouldn't make sense if it was willingly non-smoking, but still, that's my only complaint about the night.\u000a\u000a\u000aand a shout-out to amy c. for reminding me of what day this was via the event.

Vcash only\u000a\u000asmoke is a new little taqueria along the revitalizing 8th street. we wandered in here after seeing a business card at mostly mod claiming 10% off, having parked next to it and curious of pittsburgh's taquerias after a recent trip to the west coast. \u000a\u000awe entered the mostly empty room and found through talking to the woman that they had only opened this saturday, and haven't really begun to promote the restaurant. we looked at the menu, a modest breakfast and non-breakfast selection - which i liked. pork, steak, chicken, veggie tacos, a few sides, and a handful of drinks(including mexican coke, horchata, and agua fresca). we ordered two veggie tacos, a breakfast taco, an agua freca, and a side of mac and cheese.\u000a\u000athe first thing i drank was the agua fresca. i prefer it at taco loco as it is much sweeter, tasting and having the texture of putting a straw in a watermelon, but the version served here is much lighter and still very tasty.\u000a\u000awe found out that we had to run so we finished the rest of the order in the car.\u000a\u000athe first thing we found was that the mac and cheese was absolutely wonderful. creamy and flavorful, nothing fancy, just really good mac and cheese. and for $3 we got a lot of it, so we were both happy to split it.\u000a\u000athe tacos were ok, definitely not authentic mexican(and the place doesn't claim to be, mind you, it is titled a barbecue taqueria) but pretty good tasting. the tortillas are homemade and you can tell, they taste warm and fresh. the filling on the veggie tacos was just mushy beans - the salsa helped, but it could be helped even more by some sour cream or some extra veggies. the breakfast taco was very good, a lot of egg on it and the flavors really worked.\u000a\u000athis place only has a few seats and a single table, but it really isn't a sit down place as much as a grab-and-go, that you might want to eat in. it could be helped by some chips, salsa, guacamole, etc. overall the place supports fresh local ingredients and has eco-friendly containers. the service was wonderful and the price was right(you can have a feast here for the price of a taco at yo rita), so we'll definitely be back.

Vstill cash only\u000acall ahead to make sure they're open\u000a\u000ait's only been just over a month, and i have to update my review, since i've been here numerous times, and tried just about the whole menu - and i've felt bad about only giving 4 stars the last time because it's too good to deserve less.\u000a\u000a this is one of my favorite places to stop in and check up on. the drinks are always amazing - rotating agua fresca flavors with fresh lime zest, fresh squeezed lemonade - which now comes in rotating flavors! i had the raspberry lemonade today, it came topped with a generous portion of raspberry puree and the fresh tart raspberry flavor went perfectly with the sweet and sour lemonade. rumor has it they might try blueberry tomorrow, which sounded even more interesting.\u000a\u000athe tacos here really stand out. i know in my last review i was skeptical, but that was in their first week, and i got them to go with the sauce on the side. now, every time i have them they're amazing. my favorites are the mexican migas - a breakfast taco with eggs, onions, peppers, and fried tortilla strips, the veggie with avocado creme, and the rib - whose porter bbq sauce and the bright red smoke ring is enough to make me have dreams about returning here. beyond that, the mac & cheese, topped with a super sharp cheddar is still out of this world.\u000a\u000athere are now some tables for groups to eat at, but the seating is still limited so you might want to call ahead. also, their small kitchen has been met with a great response - meaning they can, and do, sell out at times. today they sold out of everything before 3pm and had to close - so call ahead and make sure they're still open.\u000a\u000athe service here is also super friendly, and sometimes if they're busy it takes them a little while (10-15minutes) to get your order, but it's always worth it. there seem to be some vague plans being tossed around: a downstairs seating area, a brewery, etc. i'm super excited to see what else smoke has in store

Vfinally got around to trying this place today on my never-ending quest for decent tacos in pittsburgh, and i wasn't disappointed! \u000a\u000apleasant decor, an interesting menu, friendly service, and excellent food. the horchata was clearly homemade and tasty although a little week, and the tacos were delicious. i had the pork, chicken, and vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas and would highly recommend both the pork and chicken. the vegetarian was decent but paled in comparison to the others. \u000a\u000amy only slight complaint is that all the tacos came wrapped up in foil which seems kind of wasteful - i would prefer to see them served on standard plates. also, the time it takes to receive the tacos is quite long!\u000a\u000ai will definitely be back in the future!

Vmmmmm.  taqueria.  the word itself evokes such happiness.  i've heard lots of buzz about this place, and when i had a meeting in the neighborhood, i took the chance to check it out.  it's a pretty sparse place, with only a few tables and stools.  but it still somehow looks trendy.  empty-chic?\u000a\u000ai took a paper menu and sat at a stool, and a server took my order.  my horchata appeared quickly - if you haven't tried this before, i highly recommend it, and smoke makes a nice version.  horchata is made differently everywhere, but you'll usually find it milky and spiced with cinnamon and vanilla.  it's actually made with rice, but don't let that weird you out.  it's pronounced "or cha ta" and smoke's version has a little bit of lime zest on top, which was fun.\u000a\u000amy tacos took a solid 15 minutes to appear, which was fine - it isn't fast food, but i also didn't experience the super-slow service people described below.  i was there at 130 pm on a thursday, for what it's worth.  my tacos came wrapped in foil and presented to me with napkins - i get that it's street food and all, but i sort of expected, since i was "dining in," that there'd be like.... a plate.  even a paper plate.  so things got messy.  though that is part of the fun of tacos.\u000a\u000ai got the chorizo taco and the veggie - both were tasty.  chorizo was $4, and veggie was $3.  they are bigger than hard-shell taqueria tacos, but they aren't too big...maybe 1/3 the size of a chipotle burrito?  two tacos were plenty for me.  the server recommended two tacos and a side dish for one person - but i'd say only do that if you are hongray.  i couldn't stuff all that in my face, no sir.\u000a\u000athe chorizo taco had pinto beans in it, and some salsa goodness.  it was fresh-tasting and yummy....the tortillas are handmade, but they are flour tortillas, and i think they could really use a corn tortilla option, just sayin'.  i liked the veggie one, filled with corn and black beans.  the veggies were cold in the taco, which was also not ideal, and i would've loved some cheese on them, but they did not have that option listed on the menu.\u000a\u000aso my meal was $11 for two tacos and a dandy horchata, which i think is pretty spot-on fair.  easy parking on 8th ave cost me a quarter.  i think this place is a nice addition to the pittsburgh area.  the food is appealing, but frankly, it's not hugely different from chipotle.  and chipotle is delicious, don't get me wrong.  smoke is a great place to visit, but it's not doing enough to stand out from the rest of the pack.  well, i guess it is in pittsburgh, it's really the only place like this that i've seen here.  and that's saying a lot - i think the latin american influence on the restaurant seen here is improving, and that is something to be excited about.  i'd come back, with my boyfriend, the next time we crave chipotle but also want to spend our dolla dolla bills on a local business.

Vwe finally made it out to smoke this week and were definitely pleased with our experience. for starters we split the black beans and slaw. the beans had a nice touch of heat to them, the apples in the slaw lent it a crisp, sweet touch which was very nice but overall it lacked seasoning. my veggie taco was tasty, i loved that they used corn right off the cob! it gave a nice crunch to every bite, but i was expecting the tortilla to be life altering based on all the homemade hype, honestly i couldn't tell the difference between them and store bought. jb ordered the chicken apple and, at the recommendation of our server, the philly and enjoyed both of them equally. \u000a\u000athe ingredients were fresh, service was great, the wait wasn't as long as we anticipated but after discussing our experience at smoke versus other places we've been, we concluded that yo rita! has a better grasp on distinct flavors.

Vany place in pittsburgh that serves horchata automatically gets four stars. if you've never had it, you have to try it.\u000a\u000areally good tacos. they are more gourmet than traditional, with interesting bbq pairings. the chicken apple sausage is pretty good, and sometimes they have a sirloin steak special that is out of this world. i personally often just get the mac n cheese (not quite as good as pig and chicken, but lord knows i can't eat there everyday) and black beans and call it a day. between the two of us, we've probably tried most of the tacos here and haven't found one we don't like yet.\u000a\u000aour only complaint is sometimes they can be really really slow. i think they need more staff in the back.

Vthis is a fun place in a great location in the cultural district.  the food is very good, and the decor is charming.  the service is fairly quick, and the wait staff is very polite and helpful.  i was surprised at the devils on horseback, which turned out to be a very delicious appetizer...and something i was not expecting at a place called "meat and potatoes."  i have heard people rave about the good food here, and it turns out to be very good and there are some fun choices, however it's certainly not the best pittsburgh has to offer.

Vit's like the chefs at meat and potatoes can read my thoughts, and know all my secret food fantasies. \u000a\u000afried chicken livers-- yes!\u000apoutine-- more!\u000amac & cheese with pork belly-- gasp!\u000abone marrow, and kobe tartare, and quail-- oh my!\u000a\u000athe space, the food, the drinks, they just all work together perfectly. the space and design is kind of "rustic hipster," if that's a thing. it works perfectly for a late dinner after the opera, or a casual meet up with friends. the menus are printed and presented in a black manila folder, and specials are written on a blackboard. the service is casual but competent. that is, you feel like your server is in on the whole concept of the place; they're invested, and they're not out of place. everything was fresh, tasted homemade, and the portions were bigger than i anticipated. one of the best parts is that it's not expensive. we had 3 people, each with a drink, and each took home food, for ~$70 total. \u000a\u000aand they've got a brunch?? i'm just too excited for words.

Vooooohh poutine! you sound so dirty yet taste soo incredibly delicious in my mouth. j and i started off with this delectable treat, the frites were crispy, golden, spiced perfection, the white cheese curds lay on top of them like tiny pillows and then both are smothered in finger-lickin-good gravy. \u000a\u000afor dinner j was having a difficult time deciding so he turned to our server and asked if she had to choose, would she opt for the duck or the monk fish. after a long deliberation she concluded the monk fish was the way to go and j went with it. the portion of fish was quite generous as was the bed of cous cous it laid upon. i helped myself to some of that itty bitty pasta and was wonderfully surprised how flavorful it was. i also had a small bite of his fish (i'm branching out and trying new things) the fish taste was too overwhelming for me (i haven't ate fish in 13 years) but j enjoyed it thoroughly.   \u000a\u000aas for me, i couldn't decide either, the pumpkin ravioli caught my attention immediately but so did the lobster risotto, oh decisions, decisions! i settled my internal debate by just blurting out risotto and brussel sprouts. the sprouts were fried golden brown and were slightly crisped on the outer leaves. the aioli that accompanied them was the perfect compliment and i've been eating more sprouts in various ways ever since (i still can't get jb to try even 1, but that's okay, more for me!). the lobster risotto was divine. it was super rich and creamy with huge bits of lobster throughout.\u000a\u000aas for seating, i'm not keen on the communal booth on one side with tiny tables and chairs on the other side. every table was so close to the next, it was difficult to have an intimate conversation while trying so desperately to tune out the couple next to us. \u000a\u000awe will definitely return again, and again.

Vthe husband and i went to meat & potatoes before seeing puscifer downtown.  we had a great time!  5 stars for awesome food and service.  we made a reservation, and when you do that, they ask if you're going to an event and what time it starts--so they can have you out on time.\u000a\u000awe started off with two cocktails (i got an old canadian and he got a black pepper manhattan.)  i was looking around at the online menu before we left for dinner, and much to my disappointment the old canadian was no longer on the menu at the restaurant.  however, the waitress checked and had the bartender make one for me anyway! woohoo! it was delicious maple-y whiskey goodness. :)\u000a\u000awe also shared poutine (hey, i'm an old canadian, remember??) and i was great.  not at all like the fast food nacho cheese fries i remember having in quebec as a little kid...but in a good way.  nice, crispy fries with mushroomy gravy and real cheese.  bonus!\u000a\u000ahusband got a burger (more mushrooms) and i got fish tacos, which were spicy, cilantro-y, and amazing.  even though he is a total carnivore, he said he'd order them next time.\u000a\u000awe loved the hip, dark atmosphere--it honestly reminded us a little of home (omaha).  we will definitely walk down here after dinner in the summer a few times just to get a drink at the bar, and it will probably become a regular date night spot for us as well.  i don't know why we waited so long to try it!!

Vi know that i'm late to the party on this one, but i've been trying to be pescatarian for the past half year, so it's been a bit tough to come here. that being said, we break "fast" every now and then, and meat and potatoes is a great way to get your meat on. the name is actually quite fitting, because if you want veggies at all, this is not where you're going to find that - i think about 15% of their menu might include vegetables.\u000a\u000athe pate is phenomenal, as is the bone marrow appetizer. you'll feel full just from eating that, because it is so rich. but totally worth it. i also had duck here and it was great too. also - try the red velvet dessert. it comes in a jar, which is really fitting because you won't be able to finish it and then you can just take it home in your purse. so, evidently i have broken "fast" a few times. but, why am i writing only now?\u000a\u000abecause i discovered meat and potatoes brunch - which is on both saturday and sunday. hear that pittsburgh? saturday and sunday. some of you would do well to note that many of us aren't limited to brunch on sundays!\u000a\u000aanyway, i've been having a fried chicken craving for the past month or so (if you've been a dedicated meat eater for most of your life, and then go pescatarian, it catches up with you sometimes) and someone told me that meat and potatoes does down-to-earth goodness fried chicken and waffles. let me tell you about the last time i had chicken and waffles. it was at midnight at the waffle shop in east liberty, and the fried chicken was so bad, i left it, and the waffles tasted like cardboard. but that's another story... needless to say, this fried chicken and waffles was phenomenal. the fried chicken is perfectly breaded and cooked (you can tell them if you just want dark or light meat) and the waffle is made out of this wonderful cheese-jalapeno batter that is only the slightest bit spicy. which comes with syrup cooked with bacon. \u000a\u000adid you just fall over? that must be my puddle of drool you just slipped on. sorry.

Vif you love meat then this is the place for you!\u000a\u000ai have been twice. the first time was for a work lunch. for lunch i had the black and blue burger which was on special that day. it was freaking outstanding! it was one of the best burgers i have ever had. the fries are so damn good too! service was perfect. most of my co workers got watermelon salads and they loved them as well but all said the salads needed more watermelon. also i love the big, comfy chairs. they make you fill right a home. i wish i could take a couple sets home with me!\u000a\u000athe second time i went i took my girls for sunday brunch after church. (reservations are a must on sundays!)  stupid me did not make reservations so we had to wait almost 45 minutes and scored an table indoors. initially we were told the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half for an outside table so that wasn't so bad.\u000a\u000awe started off with the fried taters as our app. my wife and i had the chicken and waffles and our daughter had the grilled cheese with some delicious tomato soup. for drinks we all had iced tea.\u000a\u000awe enjoyed the chicken and waffles but they weren't what we expected. the chicken was defiantly over coated as you had to really work through all of the crunchy skin to get to the moist chicken. the cheddar waffles were more of a corn bread consistency with a surprise kick of jalapeno. the saving grace was the bourbon bacon syrup. all i can say is wow! service was just as good the second time as the first. sarah p. was great again as she was our waitress both times. my only complaint is that there is no kids menu and there were a ton of kids there for sunday brunch. \u000a\u000aall in all a great edition to the pittsburgh fine dining scene.

Vfirst let me say that any restaurant that has fried pickles listed on the menu piques my interest.  then to read on the menu that they make their own pickles in house was an extra bonus.  these pickles were thick cut and so favorable that i could probably have eaten a whole serving of just the plain pickles, but everyone knows that frying something gives it a little extra savory flavor. the coating they use was perfect, crunchy, and complimented the pickle itself.  the spicy ranch used as a side for dipping when added made this treat, for lack of a better term, perfection.  my god, my mouth is watering even now as i write this.  enough with the pickles though.\u000a\u000awhen we arrived at meat & potatoes a show was letting out at the cabaret, so we weren't sure we would get a seat.  if we didn't there were more places to choose from in the cultural district.  luckily for us, when we walked in and were greeted by the hostess and asked if we had a reservation and our answer was no, we weren't turned away.  we were told that we could wait for a table or walk in and find a bar seat.  we opted for a bar seat, good choice.  once we sat down we were basically tag teamed by the bartenders.  one was handing us a menu and telling us the drink specials as the other was pouring us a glass of water.  the menu is small, but that didn't make the decision making any easier...at all.  it was easy to pick the appetizers, fried pickles as mentioned before and we also got an order of poutine.\u000a\u000asince i've already salivated all over myself, the keyboard and the floor because of the pickles, i really shouldn't write more about them.  i will focus on the poutine.  as it was said before by other reviewers, these are spiced to perfection and as i am going to say, melt in your mouth.  imagine if you will if you decided to go to kennywood to get some potato patch fries and instead you walk up and they were substituting meat & potatoes version instead.  just take the potato patch fries and miniaturize them.  fresh cut, fried up to a nice golden brown and tossed with some of the best spices you can imagine.  cheese curd melted throughout and topped with some of the best gravy you can find.  these and the pickles could have been a meal enough for me, but you know i didn't stop there.\u000a\u000awhile we waited for our entrees to show up, we had a libation as well.  i opted for the erie oatmeal stout while my friend had herself a moscow mule.  both were so satisfying, but i can tell you that the moscow mule was by far tastier with the combination of food we were having.  while we also waited for our food to come out the bartenders made chit chat with everyone that was seated around the bar. \u000a\u000arecently i have been on a quest to find the perfect burger in the burgh, so of course i opted for their plain jane burger.  i can say that this is one of the few places that can cook a burger to medium well and it tastes like it's cooked medium well.  perfect portion of burger too, the patty was a little thicker in the middle but i wasn't worried about that.  romaine lettuce, tomato, red onions and more house pickles to top the patty.  i also opted to add cheese, a nice white cheddar.  this time the pickles were sweet pickles and the mixture of taste with all the toppings was like a mouthgasm.  from the bun to the pickles i was very happy.  the burger was definitely an excellent decision to make that night.  more pomme frites were a side here and sadly, after all that great food, i could not finish them.\u000a\u000adefinitely a return trip to this place, and definitely a bar seat again for me.

Vmegabus is a service that is constantly improving. better busses, better staff, better punctuality, more locations. it isn't glamorous, and it isn't necessarily comfortable or exciting, but it'll get you there.\u000a\u000amy usual trip on the megabus is along the pittsburgh-state college-new york line. the trip goes as follows: board the megabus in pittsburgh, get to state college 3 hours later, stop for 10 minutes while people get off and others board, stop at a pilot/subway for 25 minutes about 2 hours later(if you're reading this from the bus and wondering how long until you can get a bottle of water, it's exit 256 on rt-80), get to nyc about 3 hours later. there are some potential congestion points: the squirrel hill tunnels if you're leaving at rush hour(4:40p bus), and the lincoln tunnels entering nyc(i've been caught up here for about 40 minutes once).\u000a\u000alateness used to be a very common thing with the megabus. when my girlfriend would grab a bus home from state college, we'd usually wait about 30 minutes for it to come, once it took at least 2 hours to come(maybe longer, we left since she couldn't get a bus in pittsburgh when she got back). once it came and left 20 minutes early without waiting for her. don't try calling customer service about it(this may have changed), they don't care - the phone number they give is to a call center, and you have to convince them to give you the real customer service number. i called asking for a refund for the bus that was 2 hours late and i was given the run-around. "i'll leave a note for my manager, she'll call you back", no call - called the manager "i didn't see anything about this, let me check for your reservation number, hold on", silent hang-up. after that for some reason i could never get through to a customer service rep again, hm.\u000a\u000alately it hasn't been late, though, and the busses have been upgraded. they used to have 1 socket per seat and sketchy wifi. the wifi is now more stable and there are 2 sockets per seat. if you have to sit next to someone, it's a lot less comfortable, but if you get the room of two seats it isn't that bad. if you sit up front on the top level you get a little extra legroom, too. however, the maximum prices have also gone up. it used to only cost $30 to go to ny, now it's $45 if you're late to the party. you can still get tickets for $1.50, and they release them a few months at a time, so i personally just spend about $10-20 on tickets if i catch them when they're just released to have the option of going.\u000a\u000aalso the last time i went the staff in pittsburgh was really friendly. these guys get a lot of stupid questions and complaints(on my bus home, a lady who spoke little english argued for 15 minutes that there were zero seats on the bus for the rest of her family. sure enough, there were actually six seats and only 4 of them. still, she argued there were zero and that they could not go home), so they really have to have a lot of patience to be in that position. also, the one bus driver whose name is frank, i think(he is kind of a bigger dude, wears a steelers cap), is really funny so if you get him that's a bonus.\u000a\u000aall-in-all it's a cheap trip from point a to point b. in pittsburgh you board under the convention center, so you don't have to wait in the rain or anything. in new york, no such luck.

Vi stopped here for lunch recently after having to do a site visit for work.  as you might imagine, pizza is their specialty but i didn't notice whether or not they have pizza slices.  they've got an individual build your own pizza though.  they've also got your typical hoagies, gyros, salads, & pastas too.  my ham and cheese hoagie was pretty good and i'm glad they have half hoagies here too.

Vi have to second the former review. \u000a\u000awho goes to kennywood and passes up the patch? lines may be long but they do go fast. the potatoes are cut in front of you and fried to golden brown perfection then smothered in whatever tickles your fancy. yes, they are a bit messy to handle that's why they give you a fork and yes, they will most definitely clog your arteries but just indulge yourself then make a couple more laps around the park.

Vfun fact: anywhere from 1 - 2 1/2 tons of potatoes are downed daily here.\u000a\u000athat should be enough to convince you i shouldn't have to explain how good this place is.\u000a\u000abut maybe, just maybe, i can't keep my mouth shut.  i mean, there is something utterly amazing about how little time there is between the initial cut of those potatoes in front of you to your mouth there is.  d e l i c i o u s!  nothing better than a fresh potato fried up then smothered with your liking of toppings (one topping is free).  if you want the bacon and cheese fries it's about $1.50 more than the regular one topping fries.  opt for no topping and decide off to the side if you want heinz ketchup or ranch dressing.  \u000a\u000abest tip for this place: lots of napkins...i mean like half the container, especially if you get the cheese topping.

Va kennywood must try!\u000a\u000athese are the best fries ever! eating potato patch fries and going to kennywood is part of the pittsburgh summer. it's almost worth the price of admission to kennywood alone!\u000a\u000ayes, the lines are long, but they do go fast. they are always cut fresh right before being fried, unlike the fast food chains that  double drop their fries. \u000a\u000ai always get the bacon and cheese fries and add ranch dressing and ketchup. other available topping include beef gravy, garlic salt, seasoned salt, and bbq salt. \u000a\u000ayou will defiantly need a hand full of napkins as you are going to get very messy!

Vthe three rivers arts festival is pittsburgh's largest summertime festival and...\u000a\u000awhat, you say you smell another susan d. concert review?  your olfactory senses are quite correct my yelp music friends!  \u000a\u000aif you're like me you basically know the tom tom club on the strength of their biggest (only) hit single, "genius of love".  you're also aware that the two main members of this group, chris frantz and tina weymouth are husband and wife and they were key members of talking heads.  in my case, my initial exposure to tom tom club and talking heads came from the movie "stop making sense".  (tom tom club would take the stage in order to allow david byrne to do a costume change).  i remember watching it with my brother and my dad and in fact tina weymouth was my inspiration.  i looked at her play that bass and i thought "hey, i could do that!"  i've still got that beat-up, dog-eared ol' vhs copy and yes it still plays well.\u000a\u000athey waited until the middle of their set to play "genius of love", instead jamming on some of their more obscure material.  no matter, the audience appeared to be enjoying it.  i know lisa and i were.  of course when they did play "genius" (which they dedicated to andy warhol), everybody got up and danced, inlcuding me and lisa.  oh and they gave us a few funky cover tunes too including "you sexy thing" (gotta dance to that one too), the al green version of "take me to the river", and "psycho killer"!\u000a\u000atom tom club always has been a funk/groove band and that they honed their chops well in talking heads really served them well.  i've got to admit that tina weymouth still looks great at age 60(?) and chris frantz always looked like a friendly irish cop.  \u000a\u000abut it's so refreshing to see a band like this that at least acts like they want to be here instead of those who are still slogging along (ahem, beach boys--what's left of them) or those doing it strictly for the money even though they despise one another (double ahem, the police).

Vremarkable festival, i attend every year.  marvelous outdoor performances, most of them are free.  lots of variety in what they offer.  i'm not crazy about the juried art show, but it's fun to look and see what's there.  lots of choices for eats at the food vendor area.

Vwhat can i say that hasn't been said about this event already?\u000a\u000ahmm, how about it's awesome.  sadly as i write this, we are down to the last couple days of the festival.  i encourage all of you to make your way down there and take in everything there is to offer.\u000a\u000alive music, amazing food, and tons of art.  so much it'll take hours for you to take it all in.  the only bad thing (but not start drop worthy) is the crowd.  the crowd can either push you along, which makes you miss something, or they hold you up, which can make you discover something.\u000a\u000aone huge improvement that i've noticed this year is that a majority of the artists now have the ability to take your credit/check card while you are there.  god bless technology.  this makes is so much easier instead of having to stand in line at one of the atms, that is if they are in operation (no fault to the festival).  \u000a\u000aand the food, nothing better than taking in the scents of the food.  vendors in tents and then there are the food trucks.  the lines for food are the indicators that it is all delicious.  \u000a\u000aif all else fails, just sit on the lawn in point state park and take in the music.  get some sun, hear some tunes, and enjoy the day.

Vfinally came off the street to give bisou a try after seeing it from my car window for so long. upon entering you're met with a hole-in-the-wall chinese restaurant sort of feel. the inside is fairly bare, and the area behind the counter is larger than the seating area(for no apparent reason), making it feel very unbalanced. on the back wall is a chalk board stating the prices and some descriptions of a few of the items, but it is not complete.\u000a\u000alook in the buffet-trays behind the glass to see namecards indicating the names of objects, their ingredients, and their vegetarian status. while this is no indicator of high quality food, when trying something as (to me) exotic as libyan cuisine it is nice to see what you're ordering before you order it. i finally settled on a stuffed pepper($4.75) and a sammosa($2.25). the guy behind the counter was very friendly and gave me recommendations.\u000a\u000aupon stating i'd like to eat in the shop, the employee pulled out plates and placed each item on a separate plate and garnished it, the presentation was nice, and very unexpected. we took the food to one of the three or four tables and split. the sammosa was delicious, warm and freshly fried, the texture of the inside was smooth while the dough was crisp and chewy.\u000a\u000ai wish i had gotten more of those, because i cannot rave about the stuffed pepper so much. it was served cold after having been sitting out for what i assume to be the whole day. the rice was tasty, with a strong kick of spice and eggplant and potatoes mixed throughout, but ultimately it was cold and dry, and the green pepper was lifeless at that point(and i don't think it was fully cooked)\u000a\u000aso that part really hurt their rating, but the sammosa was worth raving about and i'm sure many of their other items are too. it may be worth it to stick to fried foods here so that you get fresher items, but it is definitely worth a shot, especially if you like strong flavors.

Vthis place was fabulous - the best thai i've had in pittsburgh so far.  some of the best anywhere, truly!  we came on a sunday night around 6 pm, and there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant.  we got a table out on the sidewalk to enjoy the beautiful weather and people watching.  we didn't feel like boozing, so we only had water and didn't b our ob, but we'd love to come back with a bottle of wine in the future.\u000a\u000awe started with the green papaya salad, which neither of us had ever eaten but i know it's basically a staple of thai cuisine.  i would highly recommend it as a fresh, light appetizer.  it is spicy (we asked for everything to be level 3 spicy = "american spicy"), but it certainly wasn't too much to handle.  you can very clearly taste all the flavor components - sweet, spicy, sour, salty - and they blended beautifully.  love the crunchy peanuts and tang from fish sauce.\u000a\u000athen we got the massaman curry with lamb, and then we got something off their "authentic" menu - it isn't on the regular printed menu, but it is on the paper take out menus.  i have no idea what it was called, but it consisted of pork belly and tiger prawns over glass noodles in a gingery broth, cooked in a clay pot.  wow.  the curry was just incredible - the rich sauce was one of the best examples of massaman curry i've ever eaten.  we both loved it.  the lamb was fork tender, and the dish was really divine.  the "authentic" clay pot dish was great too - served very hot, fresh off the coals.  it took a long time for it to cool enough to be eaten.  it was delightfully savory, with a soothing, special flavor that was lovely when the sauce coated the noodles.  the pork belly was extremely fatty - honestly, it literally seemed like pieces of pork fat, nothing more.  i know that it's a very fatty cut of meat, but i'm pretty sure i've eaten it elsewhere and had at least *some* meat - these pieces were nothing but fat.  tasty fat, but fat nonetheless.  the shrimp were tender and lovely though, and the broth was beautifully seasoned.\u000a\u000athe prices were very similar to bangkok balcony and other upscale thai places.  massaman was $16, and i forget how much the authentic dish was....$14 i think?  still, the quality is really excellent and i think it's worth the price.  i'd love to get takeout from here sometime.\u000a\u000athis was a 4 1/2 star review easily, i think with a repeated excellent visit it could be bumped up to a 5.  great addition to highland!

Va very reasonable thai place in the heart of shadyside.  it pains me every time we walk by this place, because it looks so empty compared to mad mex.  but really, people, you should give kanok a chance!  the pad thai was one of the best we've had in the burgh so far, and the curries are done well.  add to that sophisticated decor and gracious service (and not having to wait hours to get a table plus having to scream over the table at your eating companions) - what's not to like?\u000a\u000amy only reservation about the place is their pricing - it seems somewhat out of line with other thai places in the area.  it's a little on the high side, but still worth it.

Von paper, i really like what alchemy 'n' ale is trying to do here.  but in practice, and i really hate to say it, a lot of things fell apart.\u000a\u000aso i got a groupon for this place when it first opened, and i was super excited about it.  got a little nervous as i noticed more and more mediocre reviews, but we went in for dinner on friday with an open mind.  easy parking across the street, easy to get a table.  our server strolled by to describe the drafts and give us the bottle list.  i got a draft of michigan pumpkin spiced ale, which i didn't like very much but that's my fault for not tasting it.  strong spice flavors, like cinnamon and cloves, and there was a sugary rim around the glass which i didn't care for.  oops!  i'll taste it next time.\u000a\u000aso we drool over the menus before ordering an appetizer of salt-roasted beets.  and let me say - i really need to rake them over the coals for this one.  this dish is described thusly: "chilled, creme fraiche, peppered greens, pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil."  in reality?  someone roasted a beet.  then it got cooled down and cut into random size wedges.  someone put the wedges in some salty-watery liquid, then put them on a plate next to some arugula.  no.  no.  nothing about this was $8.  the beets had this sort of filmyness on them from the liquid that was really unappetizing.  nowhere did i get "pickled grapefruit, chives, lemon oil."  or creme fraiche for that matter!  i mean, really.  this was ridiculous.  and i love beets!  it's hard to get me to not enjoy beets!  but somehow, they succeeded.\u000a\u000aso we awaited our dinner, somewhat nervously.  so my boyfriend's "a 'n' a" burger arrives - that's a burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, port glaze, and probably some other stuff.  we are told my food is coming shortly.  at least five minutes go by, no sign of my food.  my boyfriend shares his fries with me until we finally decide to just start eating his burger.  when i took my bite, i took a look to see if it was properly cooked medium-rare.  what i saw on the inside was, frankly, uncooked meat.  i am sure of this.  i'm not being picky.  the texture was different - it was the texture of raw beef.  like a patty that hadn't been thrown on the grill yet.  no.  we stopped a server to mention both that my food didn't yet exist, and that my boyfriend's food was basically not finished cooking.  \u000a\u000athe server took it back, and a few minutes later came back to apologize, saying both she and the chef totally agreed that this burger was not currently in a state of being edible.  she said, "can i get you a drink on the house?  or a shot?"  we said yes, and as she went off to get the shots i thought to myself that i'd rather have been offered, you know, a free burger.  or something.  we still had beers to drink and hadn't really planned on taking shots.  in retrospect, i think it'd be better service to take something we had already purchased off the bill instead of giving us a free something we weren't going to get anyway.  but we didn't really feel in a position to negotiate when she suggested shots, so we accepted.  my boyfriend got lured in by the word "jameson," turns out the shot was something like jameson + butterscotch schnapps, tasting much more strongly of schnapps than jameson, with an orange juice chaser.  kind of weird, but okay.\u000a\u000aso a little while later, my boyfriend's burger appears and i am told that my shepherd's pie is still cooking and will be out soon.  what in the hell?  seriously, 5 minutes later, my food appears.  why is that happening?  there are only two of us!  i understand when you have large parties, the meals get staggered.  but you can't time a burger and a shepherd's pie to be done at the same time?  seriously, it kind of sucks.  i was starting to believe my shepherd's pie didn't really exist, and then it arrived, bubbling super hot from the oven. my boyfriend's burger was properly cooked this time, so he got to eat it - and quite liked it, i think - and i got to eat my pie.  i liked my food too - it was pretty simple and traditional, but rich with meaty gravy and yummy potatoes.  if the food had been brought out this way to begin with (and those salt-roasted beets didn't exist), this could've been a 4-star review.  but alas.\u000a\u000awe finished our food, i needed to take some of mine to go since it was humungous, and then we got our check.  now, our server told us later that he was training so i forgive him this, but he put down that i got an $11 beer on the bill (when really it was $5), which i'm really glad we noticed and brought to his attention.  not down with accidentally paying twice as much!  when we left, we pretty much agreed - the servers did their best to make up for our experience, but we're pretty much scared away from alchemy 'n' ale.  i really wanted to love it, but sadly i didn't even come close.

Vhaters be damned, alchemy and ale impressed me tonight. while dining with a friend yesterday, i was tipped off that my groupon would be expiring in the next two days. great, i know that groupons usually mean long waits and a a certain disdain for the people using them by the time servers are exhausted with the rush of forgetful cheapies near the end of a groupon's life. hey, it's not my fault - if i could use it day of, i would... my mind has wandered by the time they're active, though.\u000a\u000ai arrived at the door to a jovial man who simply asked my name and wrote it down on a notepad - no wait time offered, didn't even ask how many were in my party(maybe it doesn't matter). regardless, he was willing to talk after what i assume to be an influx of people slowed down. the space is small: upon entering there is a bar with two bar tables to the side on the right, a dividing wall, and a 'bistro' area with probably 10 tables or so. the decor is cute, the dividing wall has fake ivy and streetlamps to give an outdoors-indoors feel. we were seated in about 15 minutes.\u000a\u000awe were seated and immediately given glasses of water, and the short black-haired waitress asked if we had been there before. we told her it was our first time, and she went off on quite an in-depth speech about her favorite items on the menu and why she enjoyed them, touching on probably 70% of the menu unprompted. when asked about vegetarianism and nut allergies, she was extremely accommodating. this girl provided service that i thought was top notch - slightly informal, but passionate, and a desire to make sure the customer is happy. the line "the chef will do his best to make sure no nuts come anywhere near your plate" shines in comparison to the usual "uh, the chef says he uses nuts, is it like.. i mean will it kill you?".\u000a\u000awe chose our entrees on her recommendation, and being lovers of the mighty beet, we also chose the beet panzella($9) - roasted beets, caramelized goat cheese, chunks of bread, arugula, supposedly new to the menu. the flavors in this dish were excellent, the bread soaking up the beet juice, and the goat cheese was phenomenal. this was my favorite dish of the night. \u000a\u000aone complaint i have about the dishes here is that it seems like the chef doesn't like to use too much salt, which may be good to some, but i like salty food - even though i hate to use a salt shaker when i go out. regardless, i found it to be a common theme throughout the meal.\u000a\u000aour entrees arrived, my girlfriend getting some sort of mushroom pasta dish($14) and me opting for the shepard's pie($16) that the server raved over. i don't eat mushrooms, so i can't speak for that, but the shepard's pie was served hot in a decently sized portion. the quantity was not so large, but this was quite heavy and i was hurting by the end of it. the flavors were good, the truffle stood out well in the gravy, the potatoes were extremely smooth and creamy, and the short ribs at the bottom were tender enough to eat with a spoon. when i got to the bottom of my dish, i snuck a couple shakes of salt onto it. yeah, even better.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend took over half of her entree home, and i finished mine but sit here with quite a lump in my stomach - i could have easily stopped half way through without much regret, so the portion sizes here are large enough to split a starter and an entree between two if you aren't super hungry. i thought the service was outstanding and the food was good - including the price of our groupon coming to around $40 was a steal. \u000a\u000ai was hesitant to come after reading the recent reviews an'a has been getting, but i have to say i would love to come back. maybe they're stepping their game back up?

Va friend of mine suggested alchemy 'n ale for a nice birthday dinner and i was super excited to accept because i have been waiting to try this place since it opened but haven't had the chance. there were definitely some hits...and unfortunately some misses.\u000a\u000afor starters i ordered the alchemy fries that the whole table shared. the truffle gravy was obviously the highlight of the dish, it was very rich and flavorful.  the fries themselves were quite inconsistent, some were cut thinner which resulted in delicious crispy fries but others were cut thick and therefore left a little limp. the crispy kale was a nice addition to the dish.\u000a\u000aj and i also split the mac 'n cheese which has the description of "better than your own". if that's the case, they haven't had mine (i don't mean to toot my own horn, but mine is pretty damn good, if there's ever a yelp potluck i'll be sure to make it). it wasn't bad but it wasn't good, just bland. if you're going to hype something up, you better follow through.\u000a\u000aas an entree i got the beet carpaccio which was absolutely delicious (however, i am slightly biased on this dish seeing as how i have an insatiable appetite for beets)  and j ordered the crab cakes. i stole a bite or two of those crabby patties, they were tasty but a bit on the small side. j was really pleased by the rice with bits of pork belly that accompanied the crab cakes. may i add, he wasn't too keen on the mac 'n cheese either.\u000a\u000ai ordered a bloody mary which was good but by no means great. blue dust's bloody mary blows a&a out of the water. the "ale" selection lacked in quantity but makes up for it in quality...i guess.\u000a\u000ato sum it all up, this is a new place that has a lot of kinks to work out, they don't have heat lamps so food comes out as it is done which resulted in my friend having to sit there and watch us eat for almost 10 minutes before she got her pasta dish (she insisted we didn't wait) and prices are a bit high for the quality of some of the food. don't get me wrong, i do not mind paying a pretty penny for excellence, but a&a just isn't there yet...i believe they are hoping to cash in on the gastropub trend.

Vgood prices(men's dress shirts $9-10), decent selection although i'll admit men's clothes are a bit lacking - definitely better for the professional or business casual shopper than the casual shopper - but since this is a place that will be frequented by mostly business folks, i think that is justified. there are about 12 circular racks of clothes, the tops of which have about 5 pairs of shoes each on, and there are some cases of jewelry around. the racks aren't labelled, so i only saw about 3 for guys, but i could have been wrong.\u000a\u000athe owner is super nice, also

Vthere is nothing i can really say about this place that hasn't been said. the owners remember our dog by name, and remember that it's actually my girlfriend who is the name on our loyalty purchase thingy. going in, we're so often treated to bags of samples - so much so that we once went in to buy food and left with nothing but samples, and didn't need to return for a week to actually purchase any. \u000a\u000athe staff is extremely helpful, and willing to answer any questions you might have about any of their products, or make recommendations based on your pet's lifestyle. they also have no problem cleaning up a bit of doggy accident, if someone can't hold it until you leave. \u000a\u000athe place is primarily a dog store, with about 70-80% of the merchandise dedicated to canine companions, but they do also have a small mammals section for cats and such. they are also home to several events throughout the months(especially great for the owners of well socialized dogs, which ours is not quite good enough to partake just yet), so be sure to follow them on facebook or twitter.

Vthis is an amazing little pet shop.  i took my little man for a walk through shadyside and had heard about this place and decided to stop in.  very nice that if you are walking and do actually want to stop in, it is a 'pet friendly' establishment so you don't have to worry about what to do with your dog while you go browse.\u000a\u000ai didn't get a chance to check out the back of the store much because having a 3 month old puppy wrapping himself around your leg fifty times doesn't make for walking through the store a fun task.  we (yes we, eli, little man) browsed through the toys and treats up front.  while we were browsing the staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and on top of their game.  they have a lot of environmentally friendly toys for your pets located there.  picked up a chew toy made from wool for eli and he has not let that thing alone since we came home.\u000a\u000aupon check out be sure to sign up for their card.  it's kind of like the petco/petsmart card.  you get an amount off after you spend a certain amount there.  they also have classes/demostrations you can attend.  if you don't mind, join their email club and receive updates about specials and classes that are going to be offered.\u000a\u000amy rating is 4.75 stars, great place that's off the beaten path.

Vi live half a block from this new pamela's location....which means i lived about 1 block from the old location.  i never went to the old location - just too far away i guess - but now that they're a cozy 1/2 block down the street, i summoned the energy to pay them a visit.\u000a\u000aha, no, i'm not that lazy.  honestly it was the outdoor tables that sold me about this location - and the fact that it's summer.  i figured we'd be waiting for a table, and who wants to wait in the snow?  actually, at 11 on a sunday, four of us got a table within about 15 minutes, so that's not bad at all.  we got a patio table too, which was great for people watching.\u000a\u000ai know this is blasphemous, but none of us wanted pancakes.  i know!  everything i read in the reviews beforehand was a rave about the glorious hotcakes.  i'm sure they are delicious, i just truly cannot eat a whole plateful of sweet dessert-esque breakfast.  maybe if i come again with my boyfriend, he will get the pancakes and i can try them.   instead, i got the corned beef hash.\u000a\u000athe savory dishes were all pretty heavy and a little greasy, but honestly pretty good.  i enjoyed the salty meat, the abundant potatoes, and the well-cooked eggs.  the wheat toast was hilariously drowned in butter...which was kind of delicious.  but it was funny in its excess.  this food is all about excess, mainly in calorie form.  i couldn't finish it, but i usually can't finish my food, so that's not unusual.  the price was right - about $6.95 for a very big breakfast.  service is quick and inattentive - don't bother waiting for your server to refill your water glass, you will need to flag someone down.  but we lingered a bit over coffee and nobody hassled us or tried to make us leave, so that was nice.\u000a\u000ai'd come back - it's right across the street - but i honestly find the menu limiting.  basically, go if you want pancakes or omelets.  the breakfast options besides those are limited.  i'd enjoy a wider variety of savory breakfast options, but frankly the food is so cheap, i'm happy to have whatever they're offering.  it's filling and satisfying, and decadent in its high-cal glory.

Vi read recently that people call coming into the city through the fort pitt tunnels as a yinzgasm.  and i can see it...or maybe more so i have seen it.  it's what makes sitting in the horrible backed up traffic so worth it.\u000a\u000ai would say that this is pittsburgh's front door.  if people call point state park our welcoming mat, this has to be the city's front door.  it's like the city of pittsburgh is saying, "hello, welcome to city of bridges.  named the 'best place to live' several times."  \u000a\u000ai'm sure anyone visiting this city for the first time are very impressed when they come here from the airport.  it's one asset that we are lucky to have.

Vi've never been an event in this place...until recently.  i was in here before to grab bite to eat at the various food spots (hot tip: one of the only burger kings still in the city (only open until 7 pm though)).\u000a\u000ait feels and looks big from the outside.  however from the inside it looks rather small.  i was puzzled how so many people pack into this place.  watching all those people walk up the hill to get there it seems like there is no way for them to all fit in this building.  but somehow they make it happen.\u000a\u000alike reviewers before, it's showing it's wear.  carpeting ripping in certain areas and other superficial marks every so often.  parking is atrocious, take public transit instead.  \u000a\u000athe people that staff this place are on their game.  they know just about every nook and cranny and how to get there from here.\u000a\u000ai will come back here for another even that is for sure.

Vit's a damon's in the steel building, what else can you expect out of it? they took over the old cafe euro spot sometime in the last year. this is in the building that i work in, and a lot of the people that i work with go down more than once a week. \u000a\u000adamon's is essentially applebee's, which is essentially tgi friday. they all have their theme variations, but their menu focuses around the same thing: "american" food(meat & potatoes). the quality of the food here isn't so great, but it tastes good - mostly due to an overabundance of salt in each dish. beware this food if you enjoy your health.\u000a\u000athe sandwiches here will run you about $9, some of the more specialty items will go up to $15. some things can get higher, but at that point why didn't you pick a better place to go? their sides are about $3, that's what i usually build my lunch around if i go.\u000a\u000athis damon's has a lot of tvs, i can usually see about 8 when i sit in the bar area, and they all have a variety of sports channels on. the bar staff is pretty nice and they're pretty prompt, even when it's crowded.\u000a\u000ai really wouldn't come here at all except when coworkers are going, even most of those times i turn them down. there are better places to grab food within a block or two, and if a quick lunch is all you need then spend a little less on it. also, who wants to eat lunch in the building they work in all day? get some air, at least in the summer.

Vi'm surprised that there aren't more reviews for this place.  i know the strip is loaded with places vying for your dollar.  but this place is for sure one of the places where that dollar gets you more.\u000a\u000aof course you need to start out on the street.  that's where all the best produce is.  prices range i would say depending on the day that you are there and what is fresh from the gardens.  after you have scoured the produce outside don't forget to venture inside.  it's somewhat of an extension of the produce outside with a mix of big lots, shall we call it.  think buys from stores that had too much.  i was able to pick up the type of hair gel i use for a third of the price i normally pay.\u000a\u000atypical spices that you would find on any grocery store shelf with a few that you wouldn't, all for about $.99.  \u000a\u000acredit cards excepted and check out here is about as fast as you can get anywhere in the city.

Vupdate: after posting a star 2 review, i got an incredibly gracious email from jamie, who i presume to be the owner.  he said he felt awful about our experience, was informing all the servers who were present in the restaurant that evening, and was willing to refund us the full price of our dinner.  i don't believe i've ever had such a genuine, kind interaction with a restaurant owner before.  i truly believe he will work with any servers to address our concerns, and that alma will only improve in the future as a result of such devoted management.\u000a\u000ahere is most of the original review:\u000ai'd been excited to try alma since i read about it in news articles - usually they mentioned it and aji picante as "exciting new latin american" spots on the dining scene.  we tried aji a few months ago and it rocked, and i'd been waiting to try alma ever since.  i went with a group of girlfriends on a thursday night.  we didn't call ahead or anything, and arrived around 7 pm.  absolutely no trouble getting a seat - the place was even a little empty!\u000a\u000awe started with cocktails - i got the "caribbean mojito" which boasted coconut and pineapple flavors.  it did have those, and sugar, in abundance.  it was a very weak, highly sweetened cocktail.  it was more like a coconut-pineapple juice drink!  as one of my friend's said "but why is the rum gone!?"  why is it gone, captain jack?  deep questions.  later, i had a glass of sangria, which was an improvement on taste but still pretty sweet.  also not very strong.\u000a\u000aso we shared some appetizers to start - notably the sweet plantains, and crispy yuca.  the yuca fries were pretty good, with a nice crunch, and served with a tasty chimichurri-ish sauce.  the plantains weren't bad, though not the best version i've had - they were sprinkled with sugar and seemed almost more like a dessert!  after dinner i had the butternut squash soup (daily special) which was very velvety and had good squash flavor.\u000a\u000afor my entree, i got the vaca frita which is similar to a ropa vieja - long simmered beef roast that is almost stringy - not in a bad way, actually.  alma's version was served with rice and pigeon peas.  the rice and peas were a little bland, though i liked the texture of the peas (good bite).  the beef really left me a little cold.  literally and figuratively.  it wasn't served hot, which several of my dining companions observed in their own dishes.  i think an improvement in the temperature would've made a difference in the taste, but the meat was still underseasoned and a little tough.  actually, one of my friends got some habenero sauce with her dish, and we all tasted it and immediately ordered some for ourselves.  i think that's telling - when every single person at the table needs hot sauce for their dish.  should've been more spice - not even heat, but flavor - in the dish as it is.  \u000a\u000ai also tasted a friend's food, who got appetizers for her main course.  she got the chicharrones (crispy chicken marinated in rum and lime).  literally, they tasted like lime-y chicken fingers.  but not even really great chicken fingers!  just....ones that have been marinated in tons of lime juice.   we felt they needed salt, and more of a depth of flavor.  i also tasted her papitas rellenas (yuca and potato pillows stuffed with seasoned beef) which were okay, but there was a much higher ratio of pillow-to-filling, so they were more potato tasting than beef tasting, which was disappointing.  and i tasted my friend's goat cheese and shallot filled empanada, which was okay.  the texture of the crust was more pastry-like than i expected.\u000a\u000ai didn't have dessert, but i tasted the tres leches and flan.  both were pretty good - possibly the meal's high point!\u000a\u000aso i'd probably be nice and give the food 3 stars, because it really was okay and even good with the hot sauce.  and the cocktails were tasty, even though they were more punchy than boozy.  but.  our service was interminably, inexcusably slow.  the restaurant was not full at all, we all observed servers chillaxing at various stations around the dining room, and we waited - for everything.  we were there for about 3 hours.  which is cool and all, we all like to linger over dinner, but you want to make the choice to linger, you know?   i understand sometimes things get behind for whatever reason, but i felt that the slow service was blatantly obvious, and the absolute least our server could've done was apologized.  but she didn't seem to notice.  and the kitchen clearly had some issues with timing, if our food not only took forever, but also came out lukewarm.  \u000a\u000awe all felt a little disappointed in the overall experience, although we did enjoy several components of the meal.

Valma is a bit on the upscale side of casual - i wasn't the only one wearing a t-shirt, but i'll probably wear a button down next time. we happened to come during restaurant week, so the menu was a little different from usual. the fried plantains came with some semi-spicy refrained beans which made for a delicious (and new to me combination). the empanadas were also good, although a little on the dry side. i'd recommend the scallops, but was only meh about the pork belly and gazpacho. overall, the food quality was good, and i liked about 75% of the items we sampled. i'd definitely come here again.

Vi was so sad to find out that this place had closed! \u000a\u000athere was a elite event here that i didn't get to go to so i just had to go on my own to see what i missed as most of the reviews from the elite event raved about how amazing the food was so i decided to take my wife there for her birthday and we had such a great experience! \u000a\u000awe had reservations and got there about 20 minutes early but, were still seated immediately. we both started off with a couple of drinks. i had the rum punch and the wife had the carribean mojito. both of which were perfectly made with lots of fruit that went well with the rest of the drink.\u000a\u000aafter a long deliberation i ordered the carne asada as i love beef which was outstanding! the steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. the rice went with it perfectly also. my wife had the grilled shrimp dish and our daughter loved the cuban sandwich that she ordered as well. \u000a\u000ai finished off my meal with the tres leche cake. it was good but, not what i expected i guess because of all the milk that is used to make it. my wife and daughter shared the chocolate cake which they both loved.\u000a\u000awhile in the neighborhood we decided to go back for another round since my wife's birthday meal was so good. we then discovered that alma had closed and something else had opened it it's place.\u000a\u000aadios alma! you well be missed!

Vmy love for t-shirts has been restored.  once upon a time i had a huge collection of quirky shirts and then noticed how un-unique they were starting to become.  then one glorious day i found commonwealth press while walking carson street on the southside.\u000a\u000ato say i was overwhelmed is an understatement.  i stood there in their shop alternating between the shelves trying my hardest to decide what pittsburgh themed shirt i wanted more.  it seriously took me a half hour to figure out which one was more appealing to me.  in the end i decided they were all equally to my standards.  i just have to go back multiple times to be able to buy each one i want.  or, for my convenience, just order them online.\u000a\u000athe staff in the shop were very polite and knowledgeable about their clothing and didn't hesitate to help me when it came to sizing.  the girl manning the store at that time was very enthusiastic about the particular shirt i picked out and so excited that i chose it that it made me feel that i was buying it for her and not me.  \u000a\u000ai was happy to see that they represent more than just pittsburgh too and kind of branch out to western pa as well.  also there are shirts there that are aimed at helping raise money for certain causes.  some shirts have a little blurb to explain the meaning behind the shirts, or just ask and the staff are happy to tell you.\u000a\u000ai truly hope that if you have a yearning for a pittsburgh themed shirt you stop in here.  it's a must.

Vit's nice to have a new place to go.  but it seems to be hit or miss at this place.  fridays seem to end up dead unless there is an event planned.  \u000a\u000akind of like a mix of lounge/dance club depending on what side of the wall you are on.  drinks, like the crowd, are hit or miss as well, the last couple times i have been here i have received skunked beer fresh from the cooler.  smoking inside, no; smoking outside, yes.  \u000a\u000agood mix of music from top 40 to actual dance music.  as for bartenders, it appears they are stationed at sections of the bar and if you are not in their section and no other bartender is around you'll have to go to them instead of the other way around.  \u000a\u000anever a cover, huge plus.  $10 minimum to use cards. but be sure to go when there is a crowd or you may be bored and leave promptly.

Vit's still hit or miss here and most times it's a miss.  they've changed up how you are able to use your card here.  if you are planning on just grabbing a quick drink then bring cash.  it appears if you want to use your card you have to start a tab at the front door, carry around a number with you all night and then stand in line before you leave to pay your tab.\u000a\u000aridiculous, it's easier to just pay as you go sometimes.  i understand they were trying to make it easier on the bartenders, but the times i visited, they were just standing behind the bar.

Vinterested to find out that osteria is owned by cioppino (right next door).  but the service and food are inconsistent.  i like the prices here, the food is rather inexpensive, so you get a lot for your money.  we had a large party and waited a long time for our food, but osteria was aware of that and they brought out a tray of free desserts.  they also did not charge one person for their beer.  so they are trying real hard to improve. let's hope they can do better!  i ordered the seafood pasta.  it was okay, just not the heavy creaminess and rich flavor i was hoping for.

Von a pleasant evening, the outdoor seating is great, because the street next to it gets almost no traffic. the service was friendly, and the red wines were mostly blends, but were tasty and affordable. the gnocchi was pretty good, as was the ricciolina. a little on the al dente side, but tasty nonetheless. one thing i was pleased by--the portion size was actually reasonable! not gigantic. a cute place we'll try again.

Vthis review has been sitting in my drafts for months because i just couldn't find the words to describe how exceptional this meal was, but alas the time has come to finish what i have started.\u000a\u000ato start our meal off i decided to get the tomato bisque which was simple and delicious. the only thing that could have made it better was a little bit of heat, i'm thinking some chili flakes or chipotle but i'm a sucker for spice. jb opted for the bone marrow brulee. i bit the bullet and gave it taste...the granny smith slaw with cilantro and lime juice was delicious and the marrow...well, it was like biting into a chicken bone but i've been a vegetarian for thirteen years so don't take my word for it, justin who is an avid fan of all things bovine, raved about the visceral dish.\u000a\u000afor dinner i ordered the fluffiest, most delicious falafel i have tasted to date and jb had the fillet medallions he enjoyed them thoroughly and stated they were in his top 5 dishes of all time. i'm a little disappointed in myself for waiting so long to post this review, a lot of the small details have escaped my recollection but have no fear, i will return to root and update...in much greater detail.

Vthe hubster and i came to check out root 174 almost a year and a half ago, when they had just opened. at the time, we didn't think that it was anything that special (except for those brussels sprouts... mm mm good). we hadn't come back for quite a long time. yet, we kept on hearing about root 174 from our friends, so we decided to give them another try.\u000a\u000athe brussels sprouts remain amazing. and, i think that the food really has potential. i had the skirt steak, and the hubster had tortilla soup and the vegan meatloaf. first, everything was incredibly salty. and i'm a savory type person, so when i say it's too salty, that's probably really salty. we've mentioned this to some friends, and they say that they've never encountered this problem before at root, so maybe we just got them on an off day. \u000a\u000athe tortilla soup was almost like enchilada sauce. way too salty, although it could have been delicious. i really enjoyed the skirt steak... extremely tender, and very nicely paired with potatoes and brussels sprouts (i love that stuff). but again, really on the salty side, so much so that i did not finish the dish. my husband's vegan meatloaf was a revelation. who knew that vegan food could be so tasty? i highly recommend trying it - the blend of salty and sweet flavors is quite exceptional.\u000a\u000athe service was attentive, and it still gets pretty loud in there. but, an overall thumbs up from me, and we'll come back again.

Vafter a failed attempt to use a groupon at pho van on friday night (they were closed for renovations for a few days), we were hungry and lugging around some bottles of beer.  we needed dinner, and it needed to be byob.  and preferably delicious.  so we came all the way back home to squirrel hill, parked in front of our own apartment, and walked half a block to the new byob peruvian joint - aji picante.\u000a\u000athe tables on the patio were all full with happy, chatty people enjoying bottles of wine.  we went inside and were impressed by the minimalist but sleek decor.  several very friendly servers agreed that it would only be a short wait for an outside table, so they seated us at an indoor table and brought over water and menus.  we placed our order, and waited about 10 minutes for an outside table, at which point we were graciously transplanted to the prime people-watching location on murray ave.\u000a\u000afirst to arrive was our appetizer of corn fritters (torrejas de choclo).  they were crispy, hot, and flavorful - served with wonderful sauces like guacamole, creamy mint sauce, and hot pepper sauce.  it was a great size too - four fritters - so we both got plenty of food.\u000a\u000athen we waited for our entrees.  and waited.  and waited.  we really don't mind waiting, especially when our server was so cheery and apologetic, but it was like....maybe 30 minutes between courses.  our server actually offered us complementary glasses of red wine to make the time more bearable.  they don't sell wine, so don't ask for it, but it was a nice way to make up for the slow kitchen.  not sure if the kitchen just got backed up with large parties - they were pretty busy - or if they are just working the new-restaurant kinks out.\u000a\u000abut, when the food did come out, it was worth the wait.  my boyfriend's seco de cerdo (crispy pork shank) was huge - "caveman" size, if you will.  the meat was juicy and flavorful, and i loved the crispy coating.  i enjoyed the chupe (peruvian fish stew) which was brimming with shellfish - and a poached egg! - floating in a savory, rich broth.  the portions were large; it's true, the prices are between $17-25 or so for an entree, but you really will get full here.  and the food was clearly fresh and well-prepared.  somebody in the kitchen absolutely knows what they're doing!  if only they could do it faster...\u000a\u000awe are thrilled to have this place in our neighborhood, and we will certainly be back.  go on a leisurely night, bring a bottle of wine, bask in the friendly service, and order with confidence.  welcome to squirrel hill!

Vwe have finally made it to aji! i have been looking forward to eating here for quite some time now. jb and arrived for dinner, the restaurant had a few tables seated both inside and out, it was not crowded by any sense of the word. the decor is warm and inviting and the wait staff is both courteous and helpful.\u000a\u000afor starters, we were offered some wine on the house...since wine makes me loopy i declined,  for starters we ordered the corn fritters which were good and served with delightfully delicious sauces, unfortunately as stated in a previous review they spent maybe a little too much time in the frying pan but the condiments managed to mask the charred taste.\u000a\u000afor dinner i had the purple potato and wild mushroom ravioli with cream sauce. when my plate came out i must admit, i was a little disappointed, i only had 4 ravioli! but, to my pleasant surprise, these tiny pillows actually had a lot of filling inside and the sauce was so delicious i had to refrain from licking my plate (good thing i passed on the wine). jb chose the lomo saltado, a chinese inspired dish. the garlic rice was a nice touch, but i found the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking. \u000a\u000aalas, time for dessert which we usually pass on, but not this time. we ordered the dulce de leche to share which was a very tasty way to end our meal. i thought it was a little too sweet but i don't really have much of a sweet tooth to begin with. i could only take a few bites but jb was more than happy to finish it off.\u000a\u000along story short, great service, fantastic meal from start to finish, reasonable prices, and warm, comfortable decor. we would recommend it too friends and return without hesitation.

Vmy husband and i have been here twice now, and even though we wished that we could give this place higher marks, the reality is that our initial impression still stands: reasonable food that is too expensive, given other options available right now in the burgh. the service is very nice though.\u000a\u000awe tried the corn fritters both times, and liked them better the second time. my husband had a squash casserole of some sort (it was served in the squash itself, a nice touch) and i had a ravioli dish. the sheer fact that i can't remember what i had makes this an ok place, rather than a good or great place.\u000a\u000aif their prices came down about $5 in the entree range, i think we'd come here more often. but, at this price range, we'll take our business to verde or salt.

Vi was really impressed by the food.  i started with the tacu-tacu (rice and beans cake) and they were delicious.  i also tried the lomo saltado, which was very good.  the menu has a lot of great dishes to choose from, and the specials were also enticing.  attentive service.  reasonable prices.  nice decor.  i especially like that the restaurant is byob and no corkage.

Vthis massive beacon of big-box hope has been teasing the east liberty community for a while now. i believe it was supposed to be open a while ago, but was delayed forcing us to stare through it's massive glass windows into the empty aisles which would soon be full of cheap, low-quality goods. what could make a target so super? will the surrounding area be better or worse now that this new neighbor has opened?\u000a\u000ai am not a target shopper, many people in my family are, though, so i've been around quite a few on the east coast. yes, this one has a fancy cart escalator, brand new carts, and a well lit parking garage, but once you get beyond that, it's just a target - maybe even a bit smaller than the one in the south hills. fluorescent lights, a tile 'race-track' surrounding the carpet-square shopping space, cheap clothes as far as the eye can see, electronics that don't even work right on the display models, and highly processed food. \u000a\u000ai read about the produce section, limited is an understatement. there was no beauty to be seen as i passed the single standing platform of bagged apples, oranges, and bruised bananas. the prices were indeed cheap - in the nearby fridge there were cherries for something like $3/lb, but most of them looked old and limpy. oh well, i guess that's why less than half of an aisle is devoted to produce. go instead to endless supply of candy, chips, cookies and pop which are all by no coincidence cheaper than the produce(but that isn't entirely target's fault). to their credit, they have a whole aisle devoted to coffee products.. none of it impressive, but it's there.. if you want pre-ground coffee - there is way more selection here than your local grocer.\u000a\u000athe hours for this store are typical of the area - open until 10pm. the mood in this store is not quite as jovial as advertised - there we no children cheering when i went, but a loud shouting match broke out in the parking lot as i left. otherwise the clientele are fairly standard fare for a target you'd find anywhere.\u000a\u000aessentially, it's as if they air-lifted any other target in america and plopped it right down on top of a parking garage and built a cart escalator to get some oohs-and-aahs. if you want to go to target, then go, but if you have been to a target before then it is no different than any other. it gets 2 stars for not being awful to look at from the outside.

Vmy favorite target!\u000a\u000ai don't know why it took me so long to review this location. it's clean, has a garage, a produce & freezer food section and even has a starbucks and pizza hut. the staff is always friendly. every time i go looking for something that's on sale in their weekly flyer they have it in stock.\u000a\u000aif you have little ones they will love the escalator for the shopping carts that meet you once you've reach the shopping floor and meet you again when it's time to leave. so cool.\u000a\u000athis location seems to have a better selection of products then the other target's in the pittsburgh area. it has a slight upgraded fill to it. maybe this location is a tarzae and all of the other locations are just targets.\u000a\u000athis target is just what east liberty needed not to mention all of the much needed jobs!

Vlet's all admit it, when it was announced that target was going to build a one of a kind two-story building with windows in east liberty we all thought it was going to be heaven wearing a red halo.  now, we can all admit the disappointment.\u000a\u000awhen i had first heard that this location was going to be two stories i had thought that meant two stories of shopping bliss, not one and one eighth story of 'huh?'  it's just a regular old target plopped over a parking lot...hmph.  granted it's shiny, it's new, it's nice to look at.  not much better to shop in though.  \u000a\u000ai appreciate the addition at this location of produce, finally giving the shady giant eagle across the street some competition on national brands.  but it still doesn't make up for what i thought was going to be pure bliss.\u000a\u000ai still do have a fantasy of hiding in a cart just so i can feel like i'm flying going down the cart escalator...maybe that's why i fight through the traffic to make it down there.

Vi live nearby, so i was excited that the new target was built right down the street from me. this target actually has  a grocery section but it's not a "super" target. they sell really good gourmet prepared meats and, on certain days, you can get a coupon to get $2--$3 off. my favorites are the stuffed pork chops and the stuffed chicken breasts.  the produce is reasonably priced and better than the produce at the giant eagle on shakespeare. other than that, this is still your typical target and the prices are still a bit high. currently,  easter candy is 50-75% off at other establishments, but target is only selling it for 30% off. the staff i have encountered have been friendly and the store is clean and organized. lately, i have become more cautious shopping over there due to recent events (knife slashing and drug arrests).  hopefully, no other dangerous or criminal activities will occur in the future.

Vclean, well-lit, with great selection.  i love the parking garage.  i mostly shop for electronics and housewares.  the check-out clerks are generally very friendly and helpful.  \u000a\u000athere was  a recent newspaper article about a homeless man stabbing people, but i believe that was an isolated incident, and they have beefed up security since that happened.

Vwe have ordered pizza from here a few times--they are one of the few places that does north side deliveries.  we usually get black olive + mushroom + hot pepper pizza, and it's just okay.  better than pizza hut but not life-changing or anything.\u000a\u000atheir cheesy breadsticks are awesome, though.  i could just eat those for dinner.  they are doughy, cheesy, and perfect.  \u000a\u000athe service has always been speedy and the delivery guys are nice.  \u000a\u000aif you're ordering online, make double sure you have your order right:  i ordered a small pizza one time on accident and called to make it a medium, and they couldn't change it for me over the phone--told me to go online and change it, which online ordering sites don't let you do.

Vwe have ordered pizza from here a few times--they are one of the few places that does north side deliveries.  we usually get black olive + mushroom + hot pepper pizza, and it's just okay.  better than pizza hut but not life-changing or anything.\u000a\u000atheir cheesy breadsticks are awesome, though.  i could just eat those for dinner.  they are doughy, cheesy, and perfect.  \u000a\u000athe service has always been speedy and the delivery guys are nice.  \u000a\u000aif you're ordering online, make double sure you have your order right:  i ordered a small pizza one time on accident and called to make it a medium, and they couldn't change it for me over the phone--told me to go online and change it, which online ordering sites don't let you do.\u000a\u000a**updating my review to add a star because we have ended up ordering from them quite often.  the pizza has gotten better, they are consistently faster than their time estimates say they will be, and the delivery guys are always friendly.

Vwe went again yesterday after church. this time the service wasn't nearly as good as the first time. we walked in and grabbed booth. a few minutes later a waitress came and gave us menus and took our drink orders. they now have a kids menu. maybe they just started offering it as we were not given one the last time? \u000a\u000aa few minutes later our drinks came and then nothing. no service for over half in hour. once the two waitresses working realized that they had both forgot about us thinking the other had taken our order they both came over very apologetic and our original waitress took our order. \u000a\u000athis time i tried the spare rib dinner. it consisted of two nice size pork ribs. for sides i had the mac & cheese and potato salad. for my soup i tried the southern fish stew. the stew was okay. the ribs were very tender but, i didn't care for the sauce. it was vinegar based. i prefer mustard based sauces. i should have stuck to the chicken! the mac & cheese was even better the second time and the potato salad was very good as well. \u000a\u000amy wife tamika got the fried chicken again, mac & cheese and greens as her sides. she choose the chicken and dumpling soap and it was very, very good! she had to remind our waitress multiple times that she had forgotten to bring her, her cornbread. it also took a while to get our sweet tea refilled. \u000a\u000aour daughter tried the chicken tenders and fries and loved them! it was nice to see her eat something else besides burgers! \u000a\u000athe owner mike walked around asking how everyones food was but, he never made it to our table as i would have told him about our waitresses mishap. she did take the drinks off of our bill though. i think if they had more then two people waiting tables this would have never happened.\u000a\u000ai do believe this was a isolated incident and will definitely give carmi another try.

Vdelicious food at very reasonable prices.  i particularly loved the greens, they were excellent.  the sweet potato fries were unbelievably great.  the waitress and owner were both very friendly.  i got the ribs, which were very tender.  the portions are big.

Vversatile space, i have been here for modern dance, plays, community forums and concerts.  all the seats have an excellent view of the stage.  the lobby is a fun place to hang out before a show or during an intermission.  this is a marvelous venue and a real asset to the performing arts in pittsburgh.  there are several good restaurants to eat close by, namely nicky's thai, carmi's, legends, james street and more.

Vwe had a fantastic curry here on a thursday night.  definitely make reservations, as this small restaurant will get full quickly!  it's byob with no corkage, so come prepared with wine or beer.  service was a bit slow, took ages for them to bring glasses for the wine, but once the food came we really had no further objections.\u000a\u000awe split the masala dosa "the king of dosas," for a starter.  a dosa is a crepe made from lentils and rice, and this one was stuffed with potatoes,onions, tomatoes, peas, and spices.  dosai are a staple of south indian cuisine; i haven't had one in years, and this one was just wonderful.  it looked enormous on the plate, but we quickly devoured it and it made a great starter for two.  the veggies inside were soft and delicately seasoned and the crepe was great with mint chutney.\u000a\u000athen we shared a chicken keera curry (with spinach and lentils) and a lamb ghasi (red and tomato-y, strong spicy flavor).  we had a lemon rice and a parotta, a south indian bread that's flakier than naan bread.  the rice was fragrant, and both of the curries were absolutely outstanding.  strong, complex flavors and not greasy or heavy at all.  they tasted fresh and wonderful.  the keera curry was my favorite, it was almost creamy from the lentils.  we were both extremely impressed, and cleaned our plates happily.  everything was quite inexpensive too!\u000a\u000athe food was really 5 star worthy, but i found the slow  and not especially friendly service to be a bit bothersome.  don't like waiting for wineglasses, and things like that.  it's really a toss-up between this place and kismot as to my favorite curry in edinburgh, but honestly we'd happily go back to either next time we are in town.  great choice if you're looking for indian food, but want something a little more unusual.

Vbased on the other positive yelp reviews, i was quite disappointed with this restaurant. the highlight of the evening was the homemade bread rolls which were quite delicious. if i went back in the future, i would probably just get the free bread and a small appetizer or some soup.\u000a\u000athe entres were "okay." i had some mixed seafood with rice, and my dinner partner had chicken with overcooked vegetables. both dishes were overly salty and not terribly exciting, but perfectly edible.\u000a\u000aif you're a fan of mallorca in the south side, you'll probably like this restaurant. it's a similar experience, although less pretentious. like mallorca it has a huge list of "specials".

Vit's been a while since i've been to shadyside, when someone asked me to go to mario's i was confused.  last time i was there it was doc's, they should have just said that and i would have known what they were talking about.\u000a\u000aany place with a deck to sit on gets a plus from me, but when everyone has the same idea as you do, the deck isn't any fun.  crowded was an understatement for the deck.  no bottles at the deck bars, only what's on tap, which isn't have bad.  and if you have a tab, you have to get your own refills, the servers roaming around asking if you want anything only take cash.\u000a\u000athe bathrooms are located on the bottom floor and can be quite an adventure not only to get to, but to survive in.  be prepared to slide around on the floor after about a hundred other people have been in there spilling drinks, dripping water and god knows what else.\u000a\u000ait is nice however that there are two sets of staircases to get upstairs.  don't have to cram into just one staircase and fight your way up.  your best bet is to use the back staircase.

Vi came in here for lunch one day, upon entering the first thing i noticed is that the space is bare: a glass case with about 5-6 different kinds of pretzels, a few plastic containers of dipping sauces, a chalkboard menu, some kids to run the cash register and what seemed to be a manger overseeing the first week or two.\u000a\u000athe menu is limited, and while i wouldn't call them expensive, i wouldn't call them cheap either. i got a sour cream and onion pretzel and the sweet and hot mustard. the mustard was the same kind you can grab at franktuary - very tasty, but almost a dollar for what amounts to be not all that much mustard(plenty for a pretzel or two, though!) seems to be a bit much. the whole pair cost me about $4.\u000a\u000asince there is nowhere inside to eat, and since it had just started to rain outside after i had entered, my bag got a bit soggy on the way back to work. the pretzel was unharmed, though, and very tasty - fresh, fried perfectly, not too doughy, but soft and chewy. the sour cream and onion powder tasted as you'd expect, and the mustard was definitely welcome.\u000a\u000aall in all, the place is good, but i hope they experiment a bit more with their flavors or sauces. since this is owned by the same people as pittsburgh popcorn company, i have high hopes that the menu won't remain static and we'll see something a bit more exciting than jalepeno-cheddar. if you like pretzels and work downtown, it's worth stopping by to grab a snack.

Vpretty darn good.  a little pricy, even for downtown, but the food is good enough to eat here again.  we checked in on yelp, and were awarded a free order of doughnut holes, and these turned out to be excellent.  the bread is very good, a little savory and fresh.  i had the sweet sausage & fresh linguine, which was cooked nicely with mushrooms and scallions.  my son had the salmon, which was also good.  seems like it's a restaurant in search of an identity.  i wish i could find something to rave about, but then again, there's not that much to criticize, either.

Vannie and i have been waiting for this place to open for a while and i'm happy to say that paul and the gang were able to navigate the ridiculous rules and regs' of local government to get this place going'.  this review will need to be updated because the menu will change after this "soft" phase and i'm being just a touch generous in my initial review due to the joint being only open for a few days and the fact that i've been out of the review game for a while now.  "brix" is owned by the team that brought you "toast" on baum.  i'm a huge fan of toast and pleased to say that some of the most enviable attributes of that restaurant have translated to brix.  brix is a wine bar.  it looked to have a great selection of wine at multiple price points with different serving sizes that allow you to sample many items...let's call it a "wine buffet" if you so choose.  this is wonderful and i wish other restaurants could copy this idea.  the space is very nice and i so hope it will be successful because this location has been the demise of so many multiple restaurants.  the most recent being "cassis" which was not to be long for this earth, with its dungeon like interior and multiple personality menu...but that's another story.  they re-arranged this place a bit.  the interior is pleasant with a large bar in the main dining room with high ceilings and plenty of room to move around.  the outdoor seating was wonderful.  they did a great job with the lighting, music and accents on the space.  it was one of the few times in recent memory that i really enjoyed eating outside.  the weather being perfect helped.   we arrived at about 730 pm on a friday and there were no tables available.  this is a good sign for the place being it just opened, however this also meant they didn't really have a system set up for seating and even though we arrived first a couple tables were seated ahead of us.  i'm not too concerned about this; because i'm sure they'll have a system resolved for this shortly.  the guy who greeted us at the door,,,troy and michael who ultimately sat us were both pleasant and professional.  mathew was our waiter and he's served us before multiple times at eleven.  this place had more than a couple big burrito alum'.  my dirty martini was perfect with just enough dirty and no garnish.  the menu is a much simplified i hope version of what the full menu will be.  it seemed to me to be more of a lunch menu, but michael assured me there will be entree' features in the future.  the prices were more than fair for the food.  we started with a charcuterie and cheese plate.  we really enjoyed this and will was able to explain each meat and cheese.  there was a large selection of some common and not so common (beef tongue) charcuterie and a better than pedestrian sample of hard and soft cheese.  we followed this up with a $5 personal margherita pizza.  the crust was okay...i was hoping for it to be a bit crispier and texturally satisfying given the brick oven.  the tomatoes were delicious and actually tasted like tomatoes and the cheese was restrained,,,which is a good thing with this type of pizza.  annie then had the prime rib sandwich and potatoes salad for her entree'.  this was served with a jus.  the potatoes salad was very good and had some type of herb i couldn't identify that added to a complexity of flavor that surprised me.  the jus was bland.  i think maybe a little seasoning or longer reduction would have aided the flavor.  i liked the beef, but annie couldn't eat too much of it.  it was very rare.  this is okay with me, but a no no for the lady.  i had the stuffed pepper.  it was stuffed with a lamb sausage and served with a roasted sauce.  it was okay, but again suffered a bit from lack of seasoning.  there were no desserts on the menu yet.   overall the space is beautiful and the service good by competent highly trained professionals.  this is a good new addition to the area and i'm sure some of the small misses will be rectified.  i believe this will be part of our rotation and i look forward to a bit more of an expanded menu.  paul, chet and the rest of the team deserve a shot at your business.

Viovino's is a great, little restaurant and a new addition to the strip of shops on beverly road.  the owner, jeff iovino, is a mount lebanon native and grew up in the neighborhood.  the food here is interesting and innovative, and focuses on local ingredients.  i had a plt sandwich - shaved and deep-fried pieces of portobello mushroom, lettuce, and tomato, on perfectly toasted white bread and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  it is a delicious sandwich that i have craved every time i've been in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000athe space itself is very minimalist and therefore can get loud, i've heard.  i visited with four friends towards the end of their lunch hours and received excellent service.  i would highly recommend it for a quick bite to eat while completing shopping or banking on beverly road.  \u000a\u000amy only gripe is the fact that they are closed sundays and mondays.  since i am usually in town on weekends, this really limits my ability to visit.\u000a\u000ahowever, the food was great and more than enough reason to set aside my minor gripe.  i hope to return soon and try more of iovino's wonderful food.

Vmeh. i was pretty enthused about this mad mex. huge open area, valet parking, close to the house, plus the big azz margaritas; i mean what's not to love? well... first of all, that huge open space? somehow no air gets in. it's so stagnate in there! please, get some fans going or something. second, i think the hostesses are still working out how to seat people. they shoved everyone in this long bench area while nice booths were sitting there empty.  finally the food was seriously meh. my shrimp were cooked to a rubbery car tire consistency. now, the plus is that they have great drink and food specials, so i suggest eating past 11pm when food is 1/2 off and drinking past 10pm when big azz margaritas are $7.

Vi have mixed feelings about mad mex.  i get really excited about going there, but the food always falls a notch short of my expectations.  but then, a few weeks or months later, i make plans to go back and i get all pumped up about it....and then the food is mediocre.  i guess i just have selective memory about mad mex - all i remember is the fun atmosphere and the chance to have margaritas with friends, and i block out the disappointing food.\u000a\u000ayesterday was my first time at this mad mex.  it was during the crazy heat wave, and i went with a big group of girls around 6 pm for happy hour.  and....the power was out.  not on the whole block, just at mad mex.  maybe their ac was cranked up so high they blew a fuse?  one of the girls in our group said this actually happened the last time she was at this location - in may - so apparently it's more than a one-time thing.\u000a\u000alots of people were leaving, since the power was out, but we actually decided to go ahead and get a table since there was no wait!  i guarantee you there would be a wait normally, but if you are lucky enough to go when there's a power outage, you get seated immediately!  the big windows provided enough light to see, and it was a bit humid in there but not too bad.  the bar was still open, so we got margaritas ($7 for a "big azz" 22 oz) and chips and salsa.  the margarita was really tasty, but not strong at all.  if i'm getting a 22 oz margarita, i want to feel tipsy - especially on an empty stomach - but i barely got a buzz with this one.  boo!  maybe their tequila bottle runs on electricity and was experiencing the power shortage too.\u000a\u000athe chips and dips were great, though.  yummy, fresh guacamole....and the pineapple-habanero salsa was delish.  i could eat that all day.  it was sort of thin, with a soupy consistency, but my goodness was it yummy.  sweet and fruity, with a huge spice kick!  i will definitely get that next time, because who am i kidding - i'll be back again, i'm sure.\u000a\u000aafter about 45 minutes, the lights came back on!  yaaaaaay!  so we got to order food.  i was pretty full on chips, so i just got a bowl of chickpea chili.  it was okay....really not that great.  it was super thin, and salty, with some chickpeas and cheese floating around in it.  it wasn't very strongly flavored, not very gourmet, not very special.  it was okay to dip chips in, but it was nothing i'd bother ordering again.  i just got it because it's one of the only things on the menu that doesn't have like, a thousand calories.  i'm really not a calorie-counter usually, but i try not to eat my entire days worth of calories in one sitting, if i can help it.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is fun, a little noisy, but you can hear your friends.  i love the big windows, and this location is much more light and spacious than the evil oakland location.  i think though, this place is not worth the hype.  with the decor and the crowds, you think "i'm having fun!"  but if you stop for a minute and notice what you're actually eating or drinking, you realize that it's okay, but not really worth the excitement.  but the spirit of the place is kind of addicting - seriously, if somebody asked me to go back tomorrow, i'd totally do it.  they've got a hold on me!

Vi went on a saturday night and i got seated right away, and my server, lg, was very helpful about the menu and the wine selections.  nobody ever said mad mex is mexican or even tex mex, it's definitely california mexican...and as long as you understand that, you will do better there.  having said that, i don't think they have a very good margarita (which should be tequila, triple sec or cointreau, and fresh lime juice).  the food at mad mex tastes great and it's made from fresh ingredients.  the decor is consistent with the mad mex branding, and there's original artwork throughout the restaurant.  i love the high ceiling, the different seating options, and the huge open wall that faces highland ave.  this is by far my favorite of all the mad mex locations.

Vmahi salad with lime cilantro vinaigrette dressing. to die for.\u000a\u000aother than that, i'm fairly "meh" about their food, but they do have a nice beer list, and the ambiance is interesting. this is a great place to go on a warm summer evening to sit outside, or near the outside area and observe street life on highland ave.

Vmmmmm, deliciousness wrapped in a tortilla.\u000a\u000awho can argue with such great food, atmosphere and service.  i've been multiple other locations for mad mex, but never been to this location prior to my most recent yearning for mexican food.  \u000a\u000aeven though parking is horrendous at this location being on a very busy street in shadyside/east liberty area, i still can't knock a star off for that.  being here at a busy dinner time i expected to have at least a little wait.  not so, we walked in, asked for a table for two and were seated immediately.  almost immediately after sitting down our waiter was there to take our drink orders.  \u000a\u000ai'm a bit of a creature of habit when i visit a mad mex location.  i'm in love with the a la carte tacos.  i mean it's too hard to choose from beef, steak or chicken...so why not get one of each.  i'm still amazed that they offer soy cheese and tofu sour cream, still can't taste the difference.  of course i was amazed by my big azz margarita as always and who can deny starting with chips and salsa.  \u000a\u000ai loved how big it was in here too, lots of space to mingle about and great when the windows up front are opened.  some outdoor seating is nice as well.  very vibrant when walking in the area.

Vwow, what a disappointment, i think i was jaded by my earlier experience here.\u000a\u000ai am quite confused but the inconsistency between each location.  and every year i always seem to run into the same problem.  no two location are alike, which cannot be a good thing.\u000a\u000afirst, why do you feel the need to always sit a party of two in that row of tables that basically crams you into the lab of the person at the next table.  it's not fun having to move your glass or plate every time someone gets up to use the restroom or leave.  \u000a\u000asecond, what was up with our server?  it was like we were partially listened to the whole night.  i've had many good experiences with mad mex, but this server may have ended my kindness towards them and disrupted my return business from ever coming back.  i asked about a particular meal and she needed to consult her manager (i was coming here to redeem my birthday meal (good for up to $30)), she came back and said her manager was fine with that and then i proceeded to order.  when we got through with the order, it's like deja vu.  she had to consult with her manager again.  but before we left, we had asked for chips and salsa.\u000a\u000athird, the wait.  after the ordering debacle, we waited and waited.  after about ten minutes of not seeing our waiter again, i had to pull another waiter over and ask if he could send her our way with our chips and salsa.  once she decided to grace us with her presence, she stated, "you didn't order this, i didn't know you wanted it."  at this point, i'm getting hot, and it was from the spicy food.\u000a\u000afourth, the food.  i had a chicken, steak and ground beef taco.  opted for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream and some beans and rice.  great to mix together.  the chicken was fine.  the steak, a little too well cooked for my liking even though i asked for medium.  and the ground beef, yuck.  it's like they just scraped what was left in bottom of the pan and threw it on a tortilla.\u000a\u000afifth, the price.  for my meal, which should have been free as it was under the $30 limit, i was still charge partly for it.  they only discounted $8 off my check.  don't get me wrong, i'll pay for my food, i'm not always a cheap bastard, but for the subpar food i just got, with the service that was almost nonexistent, i feel as i should have been compensated for more than $8.\u000a\u000amad mex, you let me down, badly.  my business can go elsewhere in the shadyside area now, or maybe that can go for other locations as well.

Vhow about a special holiday update on this place.  as you can see they have redeemed their self, at least a little bit with my most recent visit.\u000a\u000ai was craving a gobblerito, and this being the closest location to where i live, i begrudgingly came here.  i am happy to report, i survived and i was left with a better taste in my mouth (now, was that pun intended?).\u000a\u000ai am not sure if it was where we were seated this time (i requested the booth), the server (so much more attentive, she heard everything we said), or if it were the overall experience that made this time so much better.\u000a\u000awe started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  i also ordered a draft.  what i thought was going to start a downhill slip started with this draft.  the one i ordered just happened to kick the keg halfway filling up the glass.  our server, caitlin was her name, assured me that they were checking to see if they had another keg, if they did not, she would be back to ask if i wanted anything else.  i was thinking to myself, "great, here we go again," however, she returned with a full glass of my draft, with that, we were over our little hiccup for the evening (another pun).\u000a\u000aeverything came out perfect after that.  my gobblerito was amazing.  who can argue with thanksgiving food being stuffed inside a burrito and topped with gravy?  three good slices of turkey, a serving of stuffing, a serving of mashed potatoes with black beans and some corn stuffed oh so lovingly into a huge burrito.  top it with a hot serving of gravy, a side of cranberry sauce stuff, and you have your thanksgiving early.  \u000a\u000amy friends, i must warn y'all, this is a limited time item on their menu.  as i write this, i believe you only are able to get it for the next two days.  so run, don't walk to your nearest mad mex and enjoy this delectable item while you can!

Vz-best is a really good place!\u000a\u000athey have two other locations. this location is in the garfield section of the city. they offer ribs, chicken wings, wing dings, fish sandwiches, gyros and select deli sandwiches.\u000a\u000afor sides they offer baked beans, cabbage, coleslaw, greens, green beans, mac & cheese, potato salad and sweet potatos.\u000a\u000athe service is fast and friendly. note that this is a take out only location. \u000a\u000athe ribs are tasty and tender. the sides are good too. z-best is a worthy contender however, showcase in homewood is still the king of ribs in pittsburgh.

Vlooking at the pump house and the nearby water tower they seem almost eerily quiet today.  oh sure there's some hustle and bustle from the strip mall known as the waterfront.  but these restored buildings seem to be curios--relics from another time.  historic edifices for hosting events or special exhibits.  a rest stop if you will for cyclists on the great allegheny passage trail/steel valley trail.  \u000a\u000ao' my friends, the pump house and the water tower are much more than that.  \u000a\u000ayou see, the pump house was one of the focal points for the 1892 battle of homestead.  the battle of homestead is considered the most signifcant event in american labor history.  the battle began just after dawn on july 6, 1892.  henry clay frick, owner of the mill had locked out workers in a labor dispute.  he then closed the mill and fortified it.  the locals having named the mill "fort frick", broke into it.  there they met a garrison of pinkerton agents that frick had hired.  the agents had traveled up the monongahela by barge and attempted to secure the mill.  a battle broke out between the workers and the agents.  when the battle of homestead ended, seven workers and three pinkertons were dead.  scores were wounded.  the pinkertons surrendered, but alas, the mill workers may have won the battle but they lost the war.    you can read more about it here http://www.battleofhomesteadfoundation.org/battle.php\u000a\u000aas i paused on my bike i pondred the irony of it all.  here was history's greatest labor battle and what occupies the site today?  a strip mall where you can buy consumer goods made in china.

Vafter many months of waiting for a restaurant to take the space at the bottom of the glass lofts(and then many more for it to actually be constructed!), verde has finally had a soft opening to the public. why soft? the way i understand it, not of all their alcohol is in yet. regardless, i will review it as such, and take the service into account as little as possible - the star rating does not reflect the service, and i will put service related comments in a section at the end.\u000a\u000awe arrived for our 7:00 reservations and were seated immediately, the restaurant was just under half full and the bar was just over three quarters full. we were seated at a small two-person table(i hate those damn things) , and given brand-spanking-new menus. the right-hand side of the menu is the beverages: 4 or 5 margaritas from $6-8, a handful of craft cocktails for $10, tequilas running the gamut from $4 to $54 for a shot, beers for $5, and standard mexican n/a drinks. i loved this part of the menu because while i don't care much for margaritas, and i'm not much for tequila, they do offer several different tasting flights that are fairly affordable. these range in price from about 7 to 11 and offer trios by style or by brand. the tequilas are also served with a shot of sangrita - a delicious concoction that goes perfectly with tequila and tastes kind of like a bloody mary but without crappy tabasco flavor.\u000a\u000athe left hand of the menu offers about 8 appetizers($4-$10), most involving chips, soups and salads(~$8), entrees($14-$20), and tacos($4-$6/ea). while the appetizers and salads had several veggie options, there were only two entrees(and no tacos) that fell into the category. regardless, the vegetarian items were marked, so that gets points.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend ordered a 'spicy honey bbq' margarita, while i opted for the 'tequila 101' flight(one blanco, one reposado, and one anejo). we also got the fried plantains with chipotle aioli as a starter, and i got the chicken mole while she got the mushroom enchiladas. her margarita, while it had a tasty aftertaste, had a bit too much lime for me - but i she enjoyed it. my tequila was fairly self-explanatory, but i love the concept of the flight. it really lets you enjoy their differences-the smells, the tastes, the burns, etc- all at once, and allows you a better appreciation for their differences.\u000a\u000achips and salsa came first, and they were awesome. not a lot of cilantro in the salsa(i hate cilantro) and the chips tasted fresh. when the plantains arrived, their presentation was wonderful, placed on a banana leaf, but unfortunately i found that they were too thick to really enjoy. the flavor of the sauce and the cotija was excellent, but it was quickly lost while the thick, starchy plantain persisted.\u000a\u000aour mains arrived, mine over fries made of yucca and hers with red rice and black beans on the side. i found her rice and beans to be wonderful - especially the strong tomato and pepper flavor in the rice, but again my yucca was too thick and starchy to eat even the modest serving that accompanied my dish. my girlfriend said that her enchiladas were excellent as far as flavor goes, but they were fairly small and for only two of them, she felt the value wasn't quite there for a vegetarian dish. my chicken on the other hand was a fairly sizable porton and extremely well cooked - my only complaint being that i'd love more mole with it. also, being still on the bone made it a bit difficult to eat in this kind of restaurant.\u000a\u000athe desserts sounded good, but we opted out. our waitress urged us to try the sorbet when we returned. verde is a good option, and nice to see some mexican food in the area that isn't simply burritos. as we exited, the table next to us was served a chili relleno that, if it tasted as good as it looked, could have earned another star easily. sadly, though for the price and the quality, i feel that it would be hard for us to make the decision to walk past salt to eat here. as a bar lounge, i think verde excels, but as a restaurant, i think it falls a bit short. i will gladly return in a few months to give them another chance, though\u000a\u000aalso i'd be doing them a disservice if i failed to mention the free wifi and extra outlets in the restaurant. chips, salsa, a drink, and a laptop could turn this place into an excellent spot to work through lunch.\u000a\u000a-----\u000a\u000aservice: the service was poor, even for an opening night. in the two hours(!) it took us to get our food, our waitress only spoke to us about 3 times(at no point did they mention the wait, ask us to bear with them, etc). worse though, in start contrast to the image they portray through their social media presence, the service was stiff and as formal as they could try and be - it came off as inauthentic in my opinion. again, i won't dwell on the service issues because it was opening night - i'm sure they'll be ironed out quickly.

Vwent to verde last friday.  sat at the bar.  drinks were great.  tacos were outstanding.  almost everything else was bad.\u000a\u000athey had taken reservations on almost all of their tables (friday, ~8pm).  trouble was that walk-ins didn't have any place to go, so they doubled up at the bar a bit.  the bar stayed completely full, while tables were 3/4s full; the bar got *pounded*, and if a bartender tried to take a (deserved!) break, service got much worse.\u000a\u000ai asked for "no cheese", as it doesn't agree with me.  that narrowed me down to two choices; the rest of the menu had cheese, and it might be pre-prepared, since they couldn't do it without cheese.  the girl next to us at the bar wanted a corn tortilla, and they were out.  these seem like weird issues to me.  i know some things are prepared ahead of time, but "no cheese" is usually easy, and running out of a shelf-stable staple is odd.\u000a\u000athe tacos (chorizo?) were possibly the tastiest thing i've ever had in a mexican restaurant.  they also were one of the two no-cheese options i had.\u000a\u000aother than tacos, the food was bad.  guacamole, salsa, flautas, all had absolutely no salt, and very, very little spicing.  they tasted completely dead until we asked for a salt shaker and fixed it a bit.  the soup was an exception; so salty it was nearly inedible.  my best guess was that the kitchen isn't tasting any of the food, or the manager isn't trying any of the dishes, or something.  this was really surprisingly bad, as this isn't hard.\u000a\u000a\u000athe mixed drinks/specialty drinks were phenomenal.  kept ordering different things, and they were *all* good.  best drinks i've had in months.\u000a\u000a\u000aworth visiting for the bar.  hopefully the kitchen and service issues will get worked out.

Vmy yelping has been sparse since i started grad school, but i need to get back on the wagon and write a review of verde--because it was that awesome.\u000a\u000ai will start by saying that i didn't give 5 stars because i wasn't a huge fan of the entree my husband and i shared--enchiladas de verduras--because it wasn't very hot (temperature, not spicy hot) and wasn't anything special.\u000a\u000ahowever, everything else was amazing.  drinks, table side guacamole, the best tortilla chips i have ever eaten...we will definitely be back, but probably just for happy hour.\u000a\u000asince we went on "agave wednesday," half pours of all tequila shots (that are normally priced less than $18 per shot) were just $3.  they have an interactive ipad tequila menu that describes each liquor in detail, so even tequila virgins like us had fun choosing.  $5 margs were probably the best i've had in the 'burgh, no offense to that other margarita palace that i so enjoy. :)\u000a\u000ai would definitely recommend it if you're in the neighborhood...but don't make a special trip if you're really hungry.  come ready to get your drink on!

Vverde isn't bad.  i've been there twice now, and have enjoyed it both times.  the drinks are quite good.  the first time i went, i had a duck special, which turned out to be about half a duck, and kind of on the dry side.  my husband had the steak special, which was divine, so i highly recommend getting that if it ever ends up being offered again.\u000a\u000athe empanadas are great.\u000a\u000aour second time, my husband and i were trying hard to keep to our pescatarian diet.  now, this is where i think verde stumbles - it's just not very good at doing vegetarian food (at least, not the way i like it).  so, if you are vegetarian, i'd stick with the appetizers, and stay away from the main courses.\u000a\u000ait doesn't satisfy my craving for hole in the wall mexican food, but it's a nice addition to the pittsburgh food scene.

Vi had a hard time deciding between three and four stars for this place - i think 3.5 would be perfect.\u000a\u000apros: nice modern feel, good margaritas, decent salsa, interesting menu. cons: the tacos came on flour tortillas, the food was on the salty side, and the service wasn't very attentive. i feel like this place has potential, but as it stands now, it's not what i was hoping for. i would consider going here in the future to hang out at the bar and sample their extensive tequila list.

Vthe recent elite event at verde reminded me, i'm definitely in need of a re-review of this place! since our first encounter, i have taken my own advice several times and come here, treating it as a bar more than a restaurant, reveling in a variety of tequilas, and cocktails involving it. they bring around your first round of chips for free if you're at a table, and they're unlimited at the bar. along with the chips, their appetizers are usually enough to split between two people over drinks, but they usually have a few items on special so you might want to enjoy a flatbread made with the freshest ingredients they could find that day.\u000a\u000abeing one who enjoys to branch out as much as i can, i love to come in for their agave wednesdays, that is: a half-oz 'taste' of any tequila on their wall(that is usually priced under $18) for only $3! so, you can create your own flights of tequila to suit your tastes, or let the bartender know what you like and have them spin up their own. be sure to ask for the ipad menu to get an interactive look at their selection, along with tasting notes and label texts. \u000a\u000atheir patio recently opened, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. service has also been greatly improved since the last view - now very attentive and friendly, if not still a bit scripted. the bartenders are all wonderful, very well versed in all of the tequilas and in making excellent cocktails.\u000a\u000aif you're looking to grab a few drinks or get an education in tequila, and get some excellent modern mexican-inspired snacks(and maybe dinner, but i haven't tried in a while), verde is probably the best place to stop. be sure to heed the warning on the door about parking - if you park in the glass lofts lot, there is about a 110% chance of getting towed.\u000a\u000aalso, verde now serves brunch saturdays and sundays, which is delicious!

Vwith a selection of 178 tequilas...i think i'm in love.  definitely came out of there with a warm fuzzy feeling.\u000a\u000aattended the yelp event held here this past weekend and got to sample their brand spanking new brunch menu.  i'm not a big brunch person as it is, so to me this was a hard sale.  i will say i did not get to sample all the fare presented so my review on the food will be short.  i sampled the turkey sandwich and french toast brioche.  the turkey sandwich was good, but i feel like it was missing something.  not sure what, maybe a sauce, not a heavy sauce, but just a sauce to compliment all the yumminess between the toasty goodness.  turkey, cheese, avocado, red onions, and probably something i'm missing.  they all complimented each other nicely, but i still believe a dab of something would have hit a home run in my book.  the french toast brioche, in one word, amazing!  wasn't doused with all the sweetness i expected, but i thoroughly enjoyed it.  definitely will look for that again when i return.\u000a\u000athe venue itself is very pleasing to the eye.  with all the natural light coming in it is a very welcoming space.  with the agave presence everywhere.  from their emblem to the wood planks hanging from the ceiling.  as we all know, tequila comes from the agave.  which brings me to my happy moment.  tequila.  i'm not a big drinker, but i love me some tequila.  i'm sure that even if i were to visit this place on a regular basis, it would take me well over a year to sample all 178 tequilas on hand.  hey, i'm not complaining about that.  participating in a tequila tasting is quite fun and educational as well.  i now know the difference between tequilas.\u000a\u000aif you've never been here before, be sure to stop in. when nicer weather allows, seating outside is encouraged.

Vi've been wanting to come here for a while and today was finally the day. i came early in the evening and, after i was seated, i was given complimentary tortilla chips and green tomatillo salsa.\u000a\u000a i drink alcohol once in a blue moon, so i ordered a margarita that was the special for the evening. i guess it was okay as far as margaritas go. another special for the night was the tamales de brisquet. i've never eaten a tamale before, and this was pretty good. \u000a\u000adessert was a disappointment. i ordered sopapilla, which consisted of three fried pastries, two tiny scoops of chocolate ice cream and some type of honey-like drizzle. on the outside the pastries were a delicious golden brown, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. the inside, however, was very bland with a bitter taste. i did not enjoy it.\u000a\u000athis restaurant is kind of pricy. i dined alone and after 1 alcoholic beverage, an entre, a dessert and a tip, it was close to $40.  overall, my dining experience here was pretty good and i would like to come back in the future and try the brunch menu. if i ever come back for dinner, i will order an entre but stick with water and skip dessert.

Vyou won't find a better margarita in the pittsburgh area.  that's because verde starts with really excellent tequila and they don't make them too sweet.  \u000a\u000ai enjoy the food, but over the 8 times that i have been to verde, i find the quality somewhat uneven.  i will admit, much of their food is delicious, it's just that i don't know if i can count on them.  \u000a\u000athe decor is great, and the service is excellent, i really like the wait staff.

Vsolidly meh.  the service got a lot better over the last two years, but the food isn't worth the price they're charging for it.    $37 last weekend got us out of brunch with three solidly meh tacos, a breakfast burrito, and a single iced tea (including tax and tip, but still, almost forty bucks!)\u000a\u000athe tacos were pretty bland, and for that price, they should have *sang*.  the burrito was incredibly bland; cumin, chili powder, cilantro, anything would helped it along.  it felt like bad hippie food.\u000a\u000athat all said, the drinks at the bar are great, and i'd strongly recommend them.  i just wouldn't go here if food was the primary draw, much the same way i wouldn't recommend the sharp edge for its food, at all.\u000a\u000aat this point, i wish something else had went into this spot.

Vi love this place!\u000a\u000ai have been here several times and each time the food and service were exceptional! \u000a\u000ai love the decor and the lighting in the bar area is cool as well. it really takes you out of garfield and takes you on an island getaway for the time while you are there.\u000a\u000athe first time i went was during happy hour so i had to try the delicious lomo tacos (grass-fed ground beef, jalapeo feta crema, red onion and cilantro) the soft tacos were perfectly fluffy and the steak was very flavorful. the chips and salsa are a hit as well.\u000a\u000athe next time i went i had the carne asada (7oz grass fed sirloin steak, agave nectar glaze, guajillo-squash puree, roasted vegetables, salsa macha and avocado) the steak was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. \u000a\u000aanother great thing about verde is that they offer a lot of gluten free dining options for those looking for that option as well.\u000a\u000athe true reason to go here is the tequila selection. i doubt you will find a better margarita anywhere else in the city of pittsburgh or surrounding area for that matter.\u000a\u000aall in all i love the food and drinks here and don't mind paying for them but, the prices might be a bit too high for the residents in the area. i would also recommend you make reservations as at times it can be hard to score a table.

Vi'm not one for sweets. i will take a bagel over a donut any day of the week. with that being said, a friend of mine wanted some razzy fresh and were on our way when we passed pl&ld and the sweet smell was so enticing...imagine if you could, passing a place with an aroma so sweet and comforting that you close you eyes are swept off you feet, floating towards the source. well,  she couldn't help herself so we stopped in after getting our frozen yogurt.\u000a\u000aone of the friendly staffers asked if we had ever been to pl&ld, when we both replied no she gave us the option of a free sugar or glazed donut. at first i wasn't going to get anything but when i laid eyes upon the array of tiny treats, i quickly changed my mind. i ended up with a strawberry shortcake and samoa in addition to my free glazed. because i was full from brunch and dessert, i took mine home with me. the strawberry shortcake was a bit messy and it probably should have been packaged separately but 5 hours later, it was still moist and delicious. \u000a\u000asome may not like the price vs portion size, but i would much rather have 3 bites of a good donut instead of 6 bites of your average run of the mill sugary confection.

Vas the song says, "won't you be my neighbor?"  i'm sure heinz field, carnegie science center, the three rivers and the entire city has no problem with this.  everyone wanted to be mr. rogers's neighbor growing up, pittsburgh is just lucky to have him as a native son, and now a permanent resident.\u000a\u000athis spot is a nice little respite along the north shore that is quite unique.  cut from an old bridge pier it makes it look like it was a natural spot to have this memorial.  mr. rogers gets the opportunity to look out over the downtown skyline and smile upon all of pittsburgh.\u000a\u000adefinitely worth the stop if you are over here for a game or concert (just don't leave your trash here).  also, if you plan to take a picture in his lap as i did, make sure you plan your dismount.

Vit's nice we finally have a getgo in sq hill. this one is conveniently located on murray ave and forward. i think there's 10 gas pumps, and i'm not sure if any diesel. this place can get pretty crowded in the mornings. the store inside is pretty small, and there's no bathroom.

Vcompared to other get-go's, i think this one is pretty lame. first off, the parking situation is horrendous! even getting into a spot can sometimes be a clusterfluke. as stated in previous reviews, the place is very small but they have a free air pump

Vi've hated this place since it was a bp.  and even though the name has changed, nothing else has.\u000a\u000athis place is by far the worst of the worse.  this particular one is located at a very busy intersection where five roads meet.  so just picture that when attempting to enter/exit this place.  and to speak of the overcrowding of this tiny lot isn't even worth it.  \u000a\u000athe tiny store that goes along with this place is as much of a joke as you can imagine.  they have attempted to shove as much as they could in here to make it look like a typical getgo.  right down to the atm.  save your time and drive a few more miles to a different gas station, you'll surely save a headache by doing so.

Vi know it's been said before.  but who thought it would be a good idea to cram a gas station on a tiny lot right at the corner of a busy, multi-street intersection?\u000a\u000ait is kind of entertaining though, watching people jockey for a spot at one of the pumps.  or when someone forgets which side the gas tank's on!  or wacthing those who try to make the left onto murray avenue.  the times i've come here, i've found it best to enter off of forward avenue and then exiting right on murray ave.\u000a\u000aotherwise i prefer going over to cogos or gas america even though they're a little out of the way

Vnot a big fan of this location.  it's small and one hell of a task to get in and out of.\u000a\u000aat the end of the parking lot for the giant eagle nearby you have no idea where the parking lot ends or where the "road" begins before the station.  \u000a\u000athe store inside is rather small and much what a convenience store is suppose to be like.  staff are very friendly however.

Vone of the top five best restaurants in pittsburgh!\u000a\u000ai was trying to find somewhere new and different to take my wife tamika for mother's day and i immediately thought of donato's as she loves italian food.\u000a\u000ai was able to easily book our reservation on my phone using the open table app. at the time of reservation i requested a booth.  i even got a telephone reminder from the restaurant of the date and time of our reservation. when we arrived we were greeted by the host, our jackets taken and we were escorted to our booth.\u000a\u000aour waiter, john c. quickly came and took our drink orders and placed fresh warm bread on the table. our favorite was the bread that was similar to pizza. i could eat that stuff all day long! \u000a\u000af.y.i. they do have a kid's menu but, it's not listed in the menu. you just have to ask. they offer a huge cheeseburger, chicken tenders and a kids version of just about every pasta on the menu. our daughter got her usual cheeseburger and fries and absolutely loved them($10).\u000a\u000athe wife ordered the tagliatelle bolognese ($15), a pasta dish with beef, pork and veal. i tried the lasagna fresca ($16). each entree comes with either soup or salad. tamika got a salad and i got the crab bisque. it was the best i have ever had. i wanted to drink out of the bowl, it was that good!\u000a\u000atamika thought her bolognese was outstanding. my lasagna was good but, not life changing. my portion was quite small compared to tamika's huge bowl of pasta and my noodles were over cooked and almost mushy. i prefer my pasta just past al dente.\u000a\u000athe service was outstanding! tied for the best we've had in any restaurant. our glasses never got empty. all of the waiters work as a team. if a different waiter walks by and notices a  empty plate he/she whisks it away without you even noticing it.\u000a\u000aat the end of the meal we were each given a tasty ginger snap type of cookie and my wife was given a white rose which is her favorite color rose.\u000a\u000amy only complaints are that my lasagna noodles were overcooked and portion was small for the price and the kids burger is expensive @ ($10). \u000a\u000ai do highly recommend donato's and will be back often.

Vi am very loyal to the trader joe's in east liberty, however this location has wider isles and more parking.  the staff is very friendly and helpful.  i like the free samples.  there are hundreds of products that are unique to trader joe's and it's fun to talk to other trader joe's fans about what products i enjoy the most.\u000a\u000ain particular, i buy a lot of yogurt, cereal, and frozen foods.  i also like their breads, oj, trail mix, nuts, and flowers.\u000a\u000athe prices beat whole foods and also giant eagle.  shopping at trader joe's is fun!

Vmiriam w. made an extremely valid observation, tj has a lot of prepared and prepackaged product which is nice to have around for busy days. i mainly go for produce, cheese and hormone free grass fed meat and to stock up on frozen out of season veggies. the prices are better suited for my budget than the one's found at fresh market down the hill.

Vi'll be honest, after eating a delicious meal nearby, coming here was pushing the limits of my stomach. \u000a\u000aonly six flavors to choose from that you serve yourself, if the other flavors interested you, you had to ask for them. which kind of makes you not want to ask for them in the first place. how can someone else decide when enough is enough for you?  the flavors i got did taste amazing however.\u000a\u000athe toppings were a nice selection of sugary goodness and healthy fruits. it was hard to make a good balance because it all looks good as a topping. \u000a\u000a$.44 an ounce isn't so bad either, can keep you in check if you're watching what you eat.  i think the most fun is choosing a spoon, they're all neon colored.

Vthis is a hole in the wall mexican place like you might find out west; the decor made me feel right at home.\u000a\u000arating a place like this is somewhat difficult; if i were rating it amongst other similar pittsburgh establishments, i might give it four stars instead of three since most mexican places around here are so horrifically bad. the three stars represents the overall rating of all similar restaurants i've experienced including ones out west.\u000a\u000afriendly service, and the tacos were decent but not incredible. i had a chicken taco which wasn't too bad, although i wasn't too impressed with the quality of the toppings. the guacamole, for example, was not very good. i also got a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, and bacon. the bacon was undercooked and rubbery and they didn't even bother to chop it up.\u000a\u000aoverall, i would say this is a decent place, but nothing special. i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if i was hungry and nearby i might try it again.

Vthe tacos were pretty good, but the restaurant was very dirty.  service wasn't friendly.  i had been looking forward to trying this place for a long time, as a i love mexican food--the more authentic, the better--but i was disappointed.\u000a\u000ai got veggie tacos and my husband got the enchilada combo.  my favorite part was the salsa bar--fair warning, everything is hot and i love my salsa hot!!  another woman in the restaurant was complaining that the "mild" was "like fire."  i dumped plenty of the hottest onto my banana pepper filled taco and was quite satisfied. \u000a\u000aif you're in the area already and you love tacos, give it a shot--but i won't be making another trip from the north side to eat here.

Va great location for a restaurant, right in schenley plaza, and in wonderful proximity to the museums, park, library and the university of pittsburgh.  i was a bit puzzled by the music, which was a little louder than it should have been.   the food was very good.  we both got the prix fix selections, and this turned out to be an excellent choice.

Vlots of pizzas and salads on the menu, a decent looking wine list, and some nice beers on tap including one offering from east end brewing company (big hop). there are some nice tables available outside on the "porch" and plenty of indoor seating and a bar. the service was somewhat lacking; they didn't even bring me silverware, and the server seemed to run away when i tried to ask for a napkin.\u000a\u000ai tried the asparagus pizza, and crab salad sandwich. both were decent although not incredible, and the pizza was definitely on the salty side. i'll probably be back, although i wasn't overjoyed with what i had.

Vthere's nothing to not like about this place. very pleasant atmosphere with views overlooking schenley plaza. great outdoor seating. fantastic salads, with creative toppings. pizzas with enough flair to rival dinette (with slightly doughier crust, if you care about that sort of thing). \u000a\u000ait's a bit spendy for your average college student, but an excellent choice if you are looking for something a bit classier than your normal joint in oakland. good drinks too. also, kid friendly.

Vas intimated by the name, the beanthru is a drive-thru coffee joint; no sitting and pilfering free wifi for hours here ;)\u000ai wish i went there more frequently. coffee is tasty, and the prices are excellent. there's a huge menu with lots of gussied up coffees to choose from. this usually makes me suspicious, since the easiest way to disguise bland, yucky coffee is to add a bunch of crap to it. however, the barista knew his stuff, and i loved my cafe au lait!

Vgreat, cheap pizza.. definitely nothing to write home about, but my plain 18" pie was less than $9 for takeout. the pizza itself tasted good - light on the sauce and heavy on the cheese, and the crust was excellent for your basic american-style pizza. most of the menu is under $10 for pasta, hoagies, etc, and they have some pretty good coupons as well. they appear to have some daily food and drink specials. monday wing night and thursday burger night, and maybe a half-off pasta on wednesday.\u000a\u000ainside caliente there is also a bar. reasonably priced, the selection didn't seem out of this world but $4 sarnac seasonals tied us over while we waited for our pizza to come out. we also got buffalo fries - which unfortunately were not as we imagined, the potato-based cousin of the wing, but rather a knock off of buffalo wild wing's buffalo chips(thick-sliced potato chips with curly fry seasoning). tasty, none-the-less, and sometimes thin enough that the edges were crispy like a chip, delicious!\u000a\u000aall-in-all, just a neighborhood bar and pizza joint. if you're looking for a cheap pizza and you live around here, definitely give them a call.

Vordered the other night from here and of course i didn't get pizza. i opted for the burger once again (i've been on a burger kick lately). and of course this place didn't disappoint.\u000a\u000athe burger was nice and big, made sure it filled the bun. topped with the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. bigger than burgers you may find at other places in the city. i ordered fries as my side and was not disappointed with them. nice size portion for the price. they had some type of coating on them that made them a little more crunchy than what you would find at any fast food place.\u000a\u000a\u000adeliver is through grubhub, so a fee does apply (this fee varies on the place you order from, from what i have noticed).

Vvery clever, very artsy!  you can spend a great deal of time just window shopping at fraley's, there is a lot to see.  it's directly across from heinz hall on 6th street.  this is a nice addition to pittsburgh's downtown public art.

Vi was in the mood for some spicy thai food to fight off the cold on this snowy sunday afternoon. while nicky's had just opened downtown, we were looking for some coffee and other supplies in the strip and i figured i'd give this place a shot. \u000a\u000athe restaurant is sparsely decorated, having two levels with a dozen or so tables. we were shown to our seat and presented with a lunch menu. a handful of curries and popular noodle dishes, all from $7-9, plus a few appetiziers, tom yum soup, and a few rice dishes. their full menu is also available at lunch, with prices in the $12-15 range.\u000a\u000athe waiter gave us  water and took our order, each of us getting a chicken tom yum soup and me getting a green curry with beef(10 spicy), and my friend getting a chicken pad see eil(7 spicy). the soup arrived first, sadly not being very flavorful - mostly of standard chicken broth with an afterthought of lemongrass. it had a few pieces of carrot and some cilantro and flavorless chicken, and no spice to be found at all.\u000a\u000athe main dishes arrived shortly after - i wasn't able to try my friend's pad see eil, but the green curry was passable. containing mostly peppers and bamboo shoots, the few pieces of beef were tough, but the flavor of the green curry was decent enough to satisfy me. the curry was full of chiles, but unfortunately they did little to provide the spice i was hoping for. i'd have rated the dish i was given at a 6 or so. my friend was able to finish her pad see eil, but had no strong words to say about it one way or the other. \u000a\u000athe service was quick, but water was never refilled. the whole experience cost about $25 which i thought was a decent price for lunch. the portions were satisfying, not huge(but i also decided go without rice), which left me in a good mood and ready to wander through the snow again.\u000a\u000aif i'm ever in the strip, i'd consider stopping by again, but it's more likely that i'll wind up at nicky's. for a quick thai food fix, though, the fare here is decent

Vafter getting tired of my wife bugging me forever to take her here, we finally went on mothers day. i wish i had listened sooner as this place is great! no wait and no need for reservations unlike the cheesecake factory across the street which had a 2 to 3 hour wait!\u000a\u000ahere's how it works:\u000a\u000a1. once seated a server comes and takes your drinks orders and hands each of you a bowl.\u000a\u000a2. you go up to first station, the meat station and add as little or as much chicken, steak, pork, shrimp or imitation crab meat as you want. ignore the "pick one meat only " sign. you can get all the meat available if you want. there are also lo mein and rice noodles available at the station \u000a\u000a3. then you go to the vegetable station and add as much spinach, broccoli, snap peas, onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, tomatoes, carrot and more to your bowl.\u000a\u000a4. next you go to the sauce and seasonings station and pick from over twenty choices.\u000a\u000a5. finally you go over to grill. you will be given a number from 1 to 10. the number you get is were you go and place your bowl and sauce(s) and wait while your food is cooked. be sure to tip the cooks. they will give you a cheer when you do.\u000a\u000a6. and last but not least sit and enjoy. \u000a\u000aonce you have your food your server will offer you white or brown rice, lettuce wraps or tortillas to go with your meal.\u000a\u000aone bowl cost $8.99 for adults and $6.49 for kids 3 to 11, but unlimited bowls for adults are just $2 more and the second kids bowl is free. even if you're full off the first bowl go through again and take it home for lunch the next day.\u000a\u000aour server luke was great. he explained to us how everything worked. we each started off with a tasty raspberry lemon aid.\u000a\u000afor my first bowl i had lo mein, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. the cooks were really nice and talked to each person while they cooked there food. they teased us about it being our first time there.\u000alet me tell you, the food was delicious! everything was fresh and tasted so good!\u000a\u000afor my second bowl i had lo mein, chicken, shrimp, steak, mushrooms, onion, broccoli and yellow, red and green peppers. it was just as good as the first. i could only eat about a quarter of it and took the rest for lunch the next day.\u000a\u000athey also offer appetizers and desserts and have a full bar.\u000a\u000ainsider tip: be sure to check in using the yelp app to get $2 off of a bowl and also to sign up for club mongo for future discounts and free meals.

Vi am not going to be redundant so i'll just throw my two cents.\u000a\u000ai'm glad i am a vegetarian because the meat station is a little suspect...even if i were a carnivore, i'd still be a little scared. the protein station is a mess, meats get mixed together and everything is just sitting out...on a nice day, with the door opening again and again, this place will be fly heaven.\u000a\u000anice selection of fresh veggies and sauces to mix and match for endless possibilities. i can not comment on the soup and salad bar because one bowl of mixed veggies was enough for me. \u000a\u000abd's is a good value if you go hungry and plan on eating more than one bowl.

Vmy husband and i have come here twice, each time getting drinks and sharing food.  they have a great beer list, offer many classic and specialty cocktails, and have a very reasonably (read: nothing fancy) priced wine list.  each time, we both ended up ordering a beer--they always have something new and interesting to try.  \u000a\u000athere is not much that's veggie-friendly on their menu, even the collard greens and all but one salad have bacon in them!  the non-bacon salad is caesar, which does have anchovy paste.  mac-and-cheese is "meh."  i wouldn't come here for the food alone, but the h, who is a meat eater, says their burgers are good, as well as the fish and chips.  just a heads-up to the veggies out there that the options are pretty sparse.\u000a\u000ai give this place four stars for the service--it's always friendly and right-on.  the atmosphere is also really cool--both times i have been, there has been a live jazz group downstairs, but they also show it upstairs on a big tv so everyone can watch/listen.\u000a\u000athe menus are in old jazz album covers, bonus points for that!  if you're on the north side, you should give james street a try.

Vi want to talk about james street as a jazz and dance venue.  i went to hear their charles mingus festival this past weekend and was amazed by the musicianship and quality of the sound.  this is a great club to hear live jazz, they have marvelous musicians and a good stage.  i have also been upstairs to dance to live music and that's a lot of fun.  the stage upstairs is very narrow, but somehow the musicians get it to work.  the dance floor is excellent, this is the best club in town for swing dancing.  the staff works really hard, even when the club is packed with people.

Vfirst, let me say that this was my first outing after finding out my new dietary restriction.  i am so happy we ended up here because they were so accommodating to my needs.  \u000a\u000afrom the moment we walked in we were greeted with warm...good thing too, as it was freezing outside.  we arrived before the dinner rush and after the lunch rush had ended.  it was more like a happy hour crowd, read that as the bar was filled, but the dining area was not.  we opted for the two seater booth that kind of overlooks the whole place.  we were able to see the bar clearly, over top all the other patrons heads, and we were able to peer down into the dining area.  these seats give you the right respective to just how enormous this place is.  huge plus that we sat here, we were able to see the draft selections and really didn't have to ask our server (i believe her name was sharon, if not, i'm sorry, but you were terrific).\u000a\u000awe started off with an appetizer, the veggie fries.  good combination of veggies i would have never put together, coated and then deep fried.  however, i'm not a mushroom person, therefore i about gagged when i got to that one.  the dipping sauces that accompany were great, i couldn't get enough of the spicy bacon one, i wanted a bottle of that to come home with me.\u000a\u000afor my main course i stuck with a burger.  turkey burger to be precise.  cooked perfectly, with a little bit of a crust on the outside and tender on the inside.  topped with red onions, sprouts, muenster cheese, and a sweet tomato guacamole.  my god, that guacamole was amazing, i did not add anything to the burger, no need for condiments on this one.  i decided to upgrade to the hand cut fries, good choice.  lightly seasoned, and fried in soybean oil (thank you again to sharon, she went back to check it wasn't peanut or corn oil).  my friend ordered the grilled veggie, and i heard no complaints from her way.\u000a\u000awe both opted for a beer as well, a very nice mixture of beers on tap and in the can.\u000a\u000aas for the price tag, not too shabby.  we expected it to actually be more because the food was so good, but were pleasantly surprised at the end of our meal.\u000a\u000atip: do a little research for parking before you come this way.  i had no clue as to where this was or how parking is done.  most of the parking right near here is residential permit parking between certain hours.  half a block away is a public parking lot, also there is parking on western ave. which is also half a block away.

Va serious wow.\u000a\u000ai had low expectations, because i'm not really a cured meat person. but a group wanted to go, and who was i to say no? so glad that i didn't.\u000a\u000awe started with the salumi starter plate, which was a really nice way to ease into the whole cured meat thing. delicious! and good to share. we also shared a ramps dish, which was "eh" but given that ramps are in season for only three weeks a year, we had to try it. we also had the beef tartare and that was a solid thumbs up.\u000a\u000ahubby tried one of their sausages, while i had their hanger steak. normally, i am not a hanger steak kind of girl, but this really knocked it out of the ballpark. perfectly cooked, great mix of flavors, super tender... i have absolutely nothing bad to say about it, and can't wait to go back. sadly, i'd probably just have the same thing again.\u000a\u000aservice is good, and the atmosphere is a bit rustic industrial, like salt, but more intimate. what a great addition to the pittsburgh scene!

Vstopped in cure for their inaugural sunday brunch, a $35/pp fixed course byob affair. i had heard much about cure, but as i usually hang around vegetarians i had never been, so i was eager to see if it lived up to the hype.\u000a\u000athe restaurant is small and has a fairly casual interior. mostly wood, with various butchering tools and hog paraphernalia lining the walls as decor. the  music playing was good(a lot of nirvana, among other things), but probably a little loud as it could be hard to hear over it at times. they had a small table set up for the self-serve drinks, with carafes of oj for mimosas(or just drinking juice), and clarion river organics spicy bloody mary mix(with celery, pickled, asparagus, and a few other garnishes).\u000a\u000aafter we arrived it took a while for a waiter to greet us, maybe because we were still staring at the (lone) menu at the table, but at some point it would have been nice to get a hello and a more detailed rundown of the options. we put in our order - there were 4 appetizer and 4 entree selections,and 3 desserts - smoked salmon, antipasti, and strawberry gazpacho for the appetizers, 2 hangar steaks & eggs, and a duck confit benedict for entrees, and one of each dessert(cheese board, chocolate souffle, and a lemon-rhubarb parfait).\u000a\u000asimply put, the food was fantastic. simple, but perfect, with amazing ingredients. i can't recall most of the names of the items on the antipasti plate, but i cleaned it with ease. the salmon also stood out, with the plate lined with harissa yogurt making a perfectly balanced dish. the entrees too, were fantastic - the duck confit being the best i'd ever had(of the 2 or 3 times i've had it), all eggs being perfectly prepared, and the hangar steak being absolutely the best piece of red meat i've ever tasted, hands down.\u000a\u000adessert and coffee came out afterwards, again all were delicious, the souffle stood out as being particularly tasty, and the coffee was great too, served with a large hunk of brown sugar on the side for dipping to the correct amount. \u000a\u000awe chatted a bit with our waitress about the upcoming events(hog butchering, an italian bbq, dinner with notion) - cure holds them often, having a whole chalkboard full of over 10 for this summer. the whole meal took nearly 2 hours to complete, and i felt like we received plenty of food(in response to many people i've heard claiming they left hungry at dinner time).\u000a\u000ai'd definitely like try cure for dinner, i think the food certainly lives up to the hype. they are still fairly new, so i believe they may still have some dining room kinks to work out, but definitely don't let that keep you from trying this awesome spot.

Vcure has been getting rave reviews, even in places outside of pittsburgh.  so i was anxious to finally go and see what everyone was raving about.  first, the dining room is somewhat small, but very inviting.   the newest thing is that cure is no longer byob, they have added a bar recently and an excellent wine list.  our wait staff was extremely attentive and the food was absolutely delicious.  we shared the artichoke plate and also the salumi.  my entree was the pork gluttony, and my friend ordered the walleye/pike. this is a unique place to eat and i highly recommend it.

Vquaint, spacious, and independently owned coffee house that also serves breakfast and lunch. the service is friendly, and there's usually locals sitting around drinking coffee and talking. the coffee itself is fine (i prefer it to sbux) and reasonably priced. they accept credit cards.

Vi love going to bar marco.  it's a welcome addition to the pittsburgh restaurant/bar scene.  one huge thing that i love is the late night menu, bar marco is open and serving food when other places are closed.\u000a\u000ai love the food, and i especially love the new chef that they hired from legume. her food is creative and delicious.\u000a\u000ai also get the sense that bar marco is a community resource, and that they give back to pittsburgh.  there's a gallery upstairs, and i have been to several special music performances upstairs.\u000a\u000ai do notice a lot of restaurant people here, bar marco seems to be the place to hang out after work.  well, i trust restaurant people to know good food, and so i think it says a lot about bar marco.\u000a\u000athe wine list changes often, and it's rather eclectic, with lots of unusual choices.

Vorbis has a wonderful sense of community, and it earns that well by being a locally family owned business.  the coffee is excellent and the staff is very friendly.  i attended their once a month international dinner and the food was over the top excellent.

Vnoodles & company is a chain restaurant, yes, but as far as i'm concerned it's a welcome addition to the available array of oakland eateries.  it's kind of like chipotle for noodles--you pick from a menu that has menu noodle dishes that fall into american, asian, or mediterranean categories.  i have tried a couple different things here and so far everything has been pretty good.  the penne rosa is definitely my favorite!  the only downside is that the restaurant is always packed and pretty loud--but things move quickly, even so.  if you're in oakland and feel like you've tried everything around, stop here.  you won't be sorry!

Vi've been meaning to try this place for awhile now and tonight i had my chance. i have been hearing great things about it but i didn't want to buy into the new - lunchbreak - eats hype. the interior is clean and brightly lit which is always a plus in my book.  \u000a\u000athe employees are friendly and efficient, i ordered the bangkok curry, which didn't look like a curry at all but it tasted delicious. the veggies were crisp and the noodles held up nicely to the light sauce. \u000a\u000amy only problem is the value. i paid almost $9 for tofu, veggies and noodles which would be fine if i had some leftovers for the next day, but that was not the case. i could go to any of the food trucks on bigelow or at cmu and get the same quality except faster and cheaper with bigger portions.

Vthis is a wonderful sculpture by james simon.  the musicians reflect  the musical heritage of pittsburgh, and it's a marvelous way to welcome people to the cultural district.  james simon is a notable sculptor with works located at the entrance to braddock, uptown, and also a piece at duquesne university.  to learn about other nearby works of public art, check the office of public art - greater pittsburgh arts council.

Vi just heard the news that the crested duck will now be open about 3 evenings a week.  this is good news, because i attended an amazing wine dinner there last night and was overwhelmed by the wonderful food and marvelous ambiance.  their charcuterie is creative, locally sourced, and delicious.  the crested duck is byob, that that lends additional appeal, in terms of first class dining for a reasonable price.\u000a\u000awe had the duck liver & honey mousse as an appetizer and it was impressive.  the chacuterie plate with cheese featured 3 regional artisan cheeses, all excellent choices.\u000a\u000awe also had a cassoulet that was not on the menu, but it was a dish that showed the careful preparation and attention to detail that is a hallmark of one of pittsburgh's best new dining options.

Vteppanyaki kyoto is a newcomer to the highland park area serving authentic japanese cuisine. right now, the restaurant is in their soft-opening phase, where they serve lunch and dinner by reservation only. i called ahead prior to walking in for lunch, and they didn't seem to mind.\u000a\u000aentering, the space is a beautifully and minimally decorated space, with soft japanese music playing in the background and familiar items of the culture throughout the space. there is a long bench with two-seat tables along it, and in the back it seems like low group tables. along the side, though, is the centerpiece of the restaurant: the teppanyaki. teppanyaki, similar to hibachi, is food cooked on a large steel griddle in front of the customer. the differences as far as the grills go aren't striking to me, but there are no theatrics in teppanyaki cooking. suffice to say, this is not another hibachi restaurant. \u000a\u000athere are 8 seats up against the counter of this teppanyaki and currently only one chef. i sat at the counter and was handed a two-page menu, and a small drink menu including japanese beers and a small sake menu. since it was a working lunch, i had to opt myself out of the other menu. the centerpiece of the menu, and what drew me here, is the okonomiyaki: a  savory japanese pancake with ingredients mixed throughout. you can pick ingredients or select a style named after one of four regions throughout japan. additonally, the batter has fish broth in it, so vegetarians call ahead and ask if they can make vegetarian batter.\u000a\u000ahowever, upon seeing yakisoba on the menu, my insatiable noodle hunger took over me. luckily, i didn't have to opt out of trying these pancakes - they also server hiroshimayaki, which includes noodles. this is made in a separate style, with the ingredients stacked instead of mixed. a thin layer of pancake is spread on the griddle, topped with a heaping mound of cabbage, scallions, and slices of beef. eventually, it is flipped over and shrinks down as the cabbage cooks, while the chef cooks noodles and an egg off to the side. finally, the pancake is put on top of the noodles, which is put on top of the egg, which is put in a plate and smothered in sriracha mayo and a thick, dark, sweet sauce and sprinkled with bonito flakes.\u000a\u000ait was impressive to watch him work while training another chef. the preparations seem simple, but a lot goes into them. the pancake itself was excellent.  visually, the sauces are beautifully presented and the bonito flakes silently dance in the heat rising from the pancake. the flavors blended together perfectly, with the sweet sauce complimenting the slightly bitter cabbage, and the egg and noodles giving the dish substance while the beef provided a satisfying chew. i could barely finish the whole thing, but i was able to at the end. \u000a\u000athe bill for it with tax was $12, which was an expensive lunch, but they don't really have a lunch menu so it would be an ok dinner price. the menu is pretty much all in the $8-$14 price range with a few items(like a steak) getting closer to $20. the appetizers and salads are in the $4-8 range.\u000a\u000ait's always interesting to me to find out that very common food items in one corner of the globe are entirely absent elsewhere. teppanyaki kyoto tries to remedy this by introducing pittsburgh to the japanese cuisine beyond sushi and udon. i think they do an excellent job, and can't wait to return.

Vi am so excited that pittsburgh has a japanese comfort food restaurant. my husband and i went for the second time last night, and on either side of us were full blown japanese conversations. so many asians! so, you know this is legit.\u000a\u000awe've tried a number of the small plates and the okonomiyaki. everything is good. don't come here looking for sushi - they don't have it. but the pancakes... oh, cabbagey goodness. they are difficult to describe... not exactly pancakes (because they are savory) and not pizza either, because the ingredients are cooked into the pancake itself. perhaps consider adding a new term to your vocab: okonomiyaki!\u000a\u000adefinitely sit at the counter if you can.

Vi'm not familiar with japanese food except for sushi. i decided to give this restaurant a try because it's nearby and i was curious to know what okonomiyaki was. \u000a\u000ai arrived at the restaurant not too long after it opened and i was seated at the counter with a full view of the grill and the meals being prepared on it. the restaurant was nice, clean and spacious. my waiter was very kind and attentive. \u000a\u000a for a starter, i had a glass of spanish wine and bacon wrapped mochi. this was my first time eating mochi and it was very chewy.it could've been wrapped in more slices of bacon instead of one.\u000a\u000a for my entre, i ordered okonomiyaki, osaka style (shrimp, squid and pork). the top of my okonomiyaki had flakes that were swaying on it. i know it was the heat causing the flakes to move, but it was nice to pretend that the flakes were dancing along with the soft music playing in the restaurant. i don't know why okonomiyaki is referred to as a "pancake" because it doesn't look like any pancake i've eaten before. it looks more like a casserole. \u000a\u000ai had mochi green tea ice cream for dessert. i thought i was going to get a huge heaping serving of ice cream, but what was presented to me looked like a tennis ball sliced into quarters with a touch of whipped cream in the center. the mochi actually tasted better with the green tea ice cream.\u000a\u000ai am very pleased with the meal and excellent service i had at teppanyaki kyoto. i will be coming back in the future to try other items on the menu.

Vdelicious homemade style soups.  they don't cut corners, just delicious soups that will have you returning for more.  i had the clam chowder, which was a traditional new england chowder.  it comes with fresh slices of bread or a roll.  people rave about the black bean soup, so i will have to go back to try that next.  part of the fun is talking to the soup nancys (neither one is named nancy).  they are smart, articulate and funny.

Vbeing hungry for asian food in the south hills can leave one feeling a bit empty with the choices available, especially if you aren't in the mood for a belly full of cornstarch. seeing that mekong had pho and good ratings, we were off to give it a shot. we entered a mostly empty restaurant with only a handful of tables and what seemed to be one woman running the front and back(i later found out there is another woman in the kitchen).\u000a\u000awe were told to sit anywhere we'd like and immediately given water. we looked at the menu, standard american-chinese fare with some vietnamese specialties thrown in, including the pho i had come for. my brother is a fan of general tso's but wasn't exactly in the mood for it, so our waitress recommended he try the specialty 'emperor' chicken - apparently a bit more sweet and sour than your basic general tso's. \u000a\u000aalong with ordering, i indicated that my brother was severely allergic to nuts of all sorts, expecting to be given the standard response of 'oh, i'll check' or a vague 'they're cooked in the same area.. how allergic is he?'. no, the server, who referred to herself as ma, explained that only two types of dished contained nuts, and that they were kept in a plastic container away from the other ingredients - completely reassuring us that no mix-ups could happen.\u000a\u000athe food came out fairly quickly, the pho was hot but without standard items like sriracha and hoisin. no matter, the flavor was perfect, probably my favorite in the city. i was in the mood for spicy, so i did indeed ask for sriracha. she said she didn't give it because it gives the pho a lemony off-taste if you use too much of it, but that she could help me out. she went into the kitchen and brought out a small dish containing a finely sliced, bright red thai chili, warning a little goes a long way. i'm no stranger to this type of chili and throwing the whole thing in did indeed give me plenty of heat and burst of super-fresh chili flavor. i asked for a small bowl to share and she was happy to deliver that as well.\u000a\u000athe emperor chicken was ok, full of large chunks of red and green peppers and onions if you like that - i prefer broccoli as my vegetable in dishes like that. it was bright and flavorful, though, and a large portion. ma was friendly with us while we ate, asking whereabout we lived, and telling us anytime we needed to eat something good, just come see her.\u000a\u000aall in all, this place has wonderful pho. if you're trapped in the south hills looking for something warm to fill you up, or just looking for a great family-run restaurant with friendly service and great chinese-american food, stop in and give mekong a try.

Vall of upmc was elated when we got a starbucks in the hospital. walk down and back up cardiac hill just for non-cafeteria coffee?? no thank you! the line can get long, but it moves pretty fast. they've got breakfast pastries and sandwiches, little salads and snacks, and a wall of retail. be warned, though, that this location commonly does not participate in regular starbucks promotions.

Vthis is one of those places that must be spread by word of mouth.  the think it's time for yelp to get that word out.\u000a\u000afirst off the hours are only wednesday, friday and saturday from 10 am to 3 pm.  the other days they are cleaning, pricing and prepping the store.\u000a\u000ait's kind of like a goodwill meets a mom and pop hardware store.  great place to go look for a piece of furniture you might need or a fixture for the bathroom.  i went in looking for a light fixture for my bathroom and the prices are amazing.  \u000a\u000ahuge area to look through so make sure you have time to browse, you don't want to look over something that you may need.  inventory is based on what they get.  so products change constantly.  i ventured throughout the whole area and what i saw was enough to make sure i stop back in for any of my hardware needs.  they have everything  you can think of for your last minute fix you need at home.  furniture ranges from desks to dressers.  they have doors, tvs, appliances (at times), carpeting, etc.\u000a\u000abe sure to stop in here.  it is for a great cause.

Vto say anything else but delicious about the food here would be a lie.\u000a\u000ai ordered a smoked turkey wrap and could not have been happier.  instead of using a tortilla like most places do, they used a pita...a nice fresh pita, yum!  the turkey was moist, bacon was salty, tomatoes were nice sized slices and lettuce was crisp.  what pulled it all together was the honey mustard dressing (packaged, but still good).  \u000a\u000aonly downside i had with it was that it was to come with a side of cole slaw and a pickle spear.  pickle spear was lacking and tiny.  cole slaw was nonexistent.  maybe next time they will get it right.

Vthis is as good as it gets; this is one of my favorite things in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000aabout five years ago, i was a terrible woodworker, and started to look around for classes.  i found out that the community colleges didn't offer them, and didn't quite know where to look.  i then found gna (and dilegno woodshop supply), chatted with dante over the phone, and took the introductory woodworking class.\u000a\u000aat first, i thought the price was pretty steep; looking around at similar schools in other cities, the price was *very* reasonable, especially given small class sizes, extended hours, and a low-cost way of acquiring some tools.  the class was great, and probably one of the best things i've ever spent money on.\u000a\u000afast forwarding a few years, i'm now a much, much better woodworker, and owe a significant chunk of that to gna.  (thank you!)

Vthis is perhaps the best bbq i've ever had.  i will be going back soon and regularly.  wow.\u000a\u000athe couple in front of me were caterers, and claimed this was the best bbq they'd ever had.  their other claim was that "these black eyed peas are good enough to start a fight"... and yeah, they're damn awesome.\u000a\u000aeverything is smoked here; nothing is fried.  the meat is tender, flavorful, and plentiful.  i tried the brisket, ribs, chicken, and all four sides, and thought that everything - absolutely everything - was top notch, while being cheaper than takeout from any other restaurant.\u000a\u000athey had three sauces, let people sample them, and could expllain each the style of bbq the sauces were from.  the sauces had a bit of kick; none were at all hot sauce, i'd call them 'medium'.  a red tomato-based sauce, a yellow mustard-based sauce (awesome on the chicken) and a thin vinegar-based sauce (perfect on the pulled pork).\u000a\u000athe sides were collard greens, black eyed peas, cole slaw, and mac 'n cheese; all were great, probably the peas and greens being my favorites, and the slaw being my girlfriend's first choice.\u000a\u000atwo tables, no seats.  fine to eat standing up, or as takeout.  the wait is about five minutes, plus 3-5 minutes for every person in line in front of you.  if you're driving by, and there's no one in here, stop now, even if you're not that hungry.

Vit's been a year or two, and i still think these are the best ribs in town.  while union pig & chicken has upped their game on most of their menu... yeah, yinzburgh wins on the ribs.  would gladly eat here daily if my family let me.  :-)

Vi've never actually been to the physical location, however i've had their catered food on numerous occasions. i'm not generally a huge fan of barbecue style food as it tends to be a bit heavy and meaty for my taste, but i make an exception for yinzburgh! \u000a\u000athis place is crave worthy.\u000a\u000aexcellent pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, beans, coleslaw, and hot sauces. i definitely look forward to occasions when i get a chance to eat this, and one of these days will actually check out the restaurant itself.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, avoid the salads. they're pretty sad and seem like they were just poured out of a pre-mixed salad bag. the meat on top is still good, but doesn't make up for what's underneath.

Vservice was excellent, the food came out quickly. the food was outrageously delicious, especially the ribs and greens. the mac and cheese was simple, but delicious. chicken was juicy and smoky, really quite a treat. we both thought the cornbread could be improved. it was slightly sweet, but i prefer southern style, with no sugar. warnings: everything is a la carte but portions are big enough to share.    beer and spirits are offered, as well as specialty drinks like ginger beer. the lighting seemed quite dark to me, not sure if that is appropriate for a bbq joint.  seating is communal, and the place can get noisy, so we recommend seating side by side.

Vthe price range is reasonable; damon's charged about the same for a rack of ribs, and they're a sports bar.  if you're complaining on the price, you're looking for a ribs joint in the ghetto, which this certainly isn't.  the price is high (sides are separate), but not ludicrous.   the appetizers were spot-on; beans, cornbread, mac & cheese, coleslaw; these are all perfect.\u000a\u000a\u000abut the ribs and fried chicken we had were bad.  the most expensive things on our bill weren't good; the main courses weren't any good. \u000a\u000a\u000a it took about twenty minutes for our food to come out, which is a bad sign at a bbq joint; usually, the food is cooked for hours, but they should be able to serve it up quick at that point.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend had half a fried chicken, and we debated sending it back when it hit the table.  it had been in the fryer waaaay too long, and the outside of everything was burned.  it looked burned and blackened. it tasted burned.  ugh.\u000a\u000ain my case, i had a rack of ribs.  it was undersmoked; they weren't slow-cooked all the way through.  to make up for that, it looked like they'd grilled the hell out of it for those twenty minutes, and burned all of the outside of the ribs.  edible, but not delicious.\u000a\u000athe wait staff we worked with seemed very new at this.  they were perfectly fine waitstaff for a ribs place, but to make it upscale - and sell $10+ drinks! - the wait staff needs a bit more practice and polish.\u000a\u000ahaving a coat rack or coat hook or some place to put a coat in winter was also a strangely missing touch.\u000a\u000a\u000aon the plus side, all of that is fixable, and i'll head back in six months to a year, but man, there are some bugs to work out here.

Vi'll start off by saying that this isn't really my style of food. i'm not a big meat eater generally, and coleslaw, mashed potatoes, etc. are not my favorite side dishes. \u000a\u000agiven my predisposition against such food, i was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste. i sampled many of the dishes including chicken prepared in two different ways, brisket, pork, coleslaw, cornbread, potatoes, vegetables, and hot sauces. everything was good!\u000a\u000ai personally won't be running back, but if you're into this style of food, i would recommend it.

Vwow. there's lots of stuff to like about this place. the only drawback is that you'll probably leave here on a stretcher as the emts try to revive you from a heart attack.\u000a\u000athe ambiance here is not so different from salt and cure - it's got that whole rustic industrial thing going on. again, you have the communal tables from salt, which isn't a bad thing. however, the acoustics need some work; it can get really loud in here.\u000a\u000abut who cares, right? because you came here for the food. first, this is not a cheap bbq place, so you'd best get over that real quick. that being said, it's totally possible to walk out of here having spent about $20 pp and still have a ton of food leftover for the next night. so, considering that you're really getting two meals out of one, it's not quite as crazy expensive as you might be thinking. however, if you're going to booze it up, which i highly recommend, because their drinks are deelish, you're going to be paying a bit more.\u000a\u000ano normal human being can eat the three option meal. if you can, well, i hope that you also have an urban active or shadyside x membership. but, it is definitely worth trying; everything here is absolutely delicious. our group had pretty much every single option: the fried chicken (very good, but i will take meat and potatoes fried chicken and waffles over this one), ribs, brisket, pork shoulder. the brisket is by far the best, and is probably just pork belly. the mac and cheese is also a winner, as is the corn bread. we also had the tartare and the pork belly appetizers, and both were delicious (i'd take the tartare over the pork belly). \u000a\u000abut, it's all almost too much. when i walked out of here, i felt... pretty disgusting. so, i'd recommend that union pig and chicken get something on the menu that is a palate cleanser of some sort. in chinese cuisine, the tea cuts down on the grease somewhat; you guys are good at drinks, so i'm sure you can figure something out.

Vcan't give it a five-star review as a vegetarian, but this place is pretty awesome.  the husband loved his meat combo and we'll definitely be back.  i tried the mac 'n' cheese and the cornbread from his plate, both solid.\u000a\u000ai had a smoky, lime, soy-flavored butternut squash soup that was really great.  the drinks here are very creative, and quite tasty.  i was kind of bummed that you can't get harvard & highland drinks (from the bar upstairs) downstairs until after 10 pm; so i walked up and got myself what i wanted since i couldn't order it from my waitress.\u000a\u000aoh well, food is fantastic, atmosphere is fun and the place smells heavenly.  kinda has me thinking about ending my veggie streak, actually...

Vso, one thing the same, and the rest?  upgraded (and a bumped-up review!)\u000a\u000a- i think the ribs are still tough and chewy; not to my taste, although friends rave about them.  (i strongly prefer yinzburgh bbq on this one.)\u000a\u000a- the rest of the menu?  well tuned; the pork shoulder is the best in the city, and a friend vouches strongly for the chicken as well.  \u000a\u000astill weird they don't put in any place to hang your coat in the wintertime; the fit and finish here is still bizarre to me.

Vpleasantly surprised is what i can say about this place.\u000a\u000ai ordered the small tilapia dinner and expected it to be small.  what i got definitely wasn't small.  if i wasn't so hungry i definitely would have had two servings here.  \u000a\u000athe meal came with a side order of cole slaw and fries, and as others have said, two slices of bread rest beneath the two big pieces of fish.  the pieces of fish were nicely breaded and of a good size.  fried perfectly and could not find a problem at all.\u000a\u000areason i cannot give you five stars for this place...they don't have heinz ketchup :(

Vwant to know the steepest street in the world?  is it lombard street in san francisco?  no, it's right here in pittsburgh and it's canton avenue!  canton avenue is an obscure little street tucked into a corner of beechview.  it's a block long between hampshire street and coast avenue.  there is a northern stub, blocked off by jersey barriers, but what it once led to, i have no idea.   i passed by it when i had to do a site visit for work and i thought, "holy macaroni!"  the second drop on kennywood's phantom's revenge doesn't seem as steep as this!  and i always thought nearby boustead street was bad!  \u000a\u000aso when i came home, i looked it up.  did you know that canton avenue has its own entry in wikipedia?  according to the entry, canton avenue has a grade of 37%.  that means in 10 ft of horizontal distance, the elevation changes by 3.7 feet.  let's look at it another way.  the mon incline has a grade of 35 degrees, 35 minutes.  the duqusene incline has a 30 degree angle.  okay, so i exaggerated on the phantom's revenge--that ride has a 46 degree angle drop.  \u000a\u000ano matter, this street is almost gravity-defying!  could you imagine going down this on ice and snow?  or trying to get up it with a manual transmission?  could one of those little smart cars even make it up this thing?  \u000a\u000aor imagine this hill in horse-n-buggy days!\u000a\u000ajust go to google maps, type in the above address, go to "streetview" and follow canton avenue downhill.  you'll see!\u000a\u000aupdate 02/28/2012:  i had a look at streetview on google maps.  this street is so steep, you cannot drive downhill on it.  halfway down the block from hampshire ave, there are "do not enter" signs.  presumably this is to allow access to the few houses via the easier (easier being a relative thing) grade from hampshire ave.

Vit's not like the other getgo's.  if you are expecting to be able to get a soda or something freshly made, don't come this way.\u000a\u000athis location used to be the sunoco with a garage, that being the reason why you don't want to waste the time.  for as tiny as the lot is that this is located on, there are eight pumps  gas.  \u000a\u000athey do sale small items such as gum, cigarettes and chewing tobacco.  lottery service also available.

V3.5 rounding down.\u000a\u000ai really enjoy the grandview buffet at rivers casino, but i'm sometimes disappointed.  the salad bar is absolutely wonderful!  everything has always been fresh and crisp. the whole thing is set up in stations divided by cuisine - italian, mongolian, asian, american, salad and dessert bars. the italian station has been hit or miss (miss more often than not), dried out pasta, stale breads, the only thing i've ever liked from the italian station has been the broccolini, but it's not always available. the mongolian station has the friendliest employees by far and the food is always fresh and tasty and you can pick you own sauces and how much you want on your dish which is always a plus! i've never really sampled anything from the asian bar because i'm such a fan of the mongolian, but it has more prepared dishes rather than fresh. the american bar has spiral mac 'n cheese (meh), potatoes, meats, grilled veggies which are fantastic when they're not charred, and crab legs!!!! they';re not the greatest but they are substantial and i've been known to put away a plate or two! i skip the desserts, they may look pretty but i haven't found any that i'm fond of, then again i don't have much of a sweet tooth.

Vfinally, a buffet that's within city limits. there are different food stations: italian, mongolian, asian, american, bbq, a large salad bar and a kick ass desserts station. i think the food was great. even though the pizza was good, i did not care for the italian food because it was all starches and no meatballs. the dining area was very classy, like i was eating at an expensive restaurant and not at a golden corral. i've told a couple of my friends about grandview buffet and i will definitely be back.

Vif you are looking for an authentic dinner experience, you simply must visit johnny's diner.  i do miss certain things about pip's, however many of the same employees work here that used to work at pip's.  gone is the "table of knowledge" plaque, but the community table is still there.   gone are some of the quirky eastern european foods, such as pierogi, but the traditional diner/breakfast foods are still there.  i like that i can order grits, that's fairly unique for pittsburgh.  i love the smile and conversation that comes with the really good down home food.  hash brown potatoes are excellent.  marvelous toast.  great food!

Vfairly big getgo, but such an odd location.  opening up it did close down a gas station down the street.  \u000a\u000aplenty of pumps so even during a rush you should be able to get in and get your gas in a hurry.  the inside, even though it is a larger location, doesn't feel too big.  it actually feels like everything is jammed in there.  it's not hard to actually bump into somebody and not even mean to do it.\u000a\u000a3 stars, yeah, 3 stars it is.

Vindustry is a new bar along butler street. having seen the layout in the windows for many months leading up to their opening, when i found out they opened i had to stop in and check it out. we walked in just before dinnertime and asked if they had a happy hour - they don't, yet, but assured me within a week they'd have one figured out. the hostess encouraged us to look at the food and drink menus, all printed on sheets that look like industrial part-order forms, each several pages long.  \u000a\u000awe had just gotten dinner at nearby st. matthew's fish fry, so we weren't hungry, but decided we'd sit at the bar and grab a drink. the room is very nice looking, a wide open space with a very large bar in the middle, a somewhat open kitchen off in the back. bright light shines in through the bay windows, but beautiful hanging light fixtures are all around the restaurant. there are high and low tables, semi-communal bench seating, and tables around the outside. \u000a\u000athe bar contains a very large liquor selection, in addition to its 40 taps - 2 of them being house brews(with taps made of working lights). at the front there are many containers of various plant matter soaking in alcohol, which we found out was a blood orange-soaked ketel one orange, a cucumber-soaked hendrick's gin, and what ultimately wound up in my drink, a bing-cherry soaked maker's mark. what i ordered was essentially a manhattan made with this concoction - beautifully served in an oversized glass with a single, (nearly) crystal-clear, extra-large ice cube and a cherry. the taste was slightly sweet and with little bite, but the flavor of the cherry really came through and made it very pleasant to sip. the bartender told us about one of their sweeter drinks, the confetti - something like a cake-flavored white russian with jimmies and a 'cake frosted glass'. what really interested me on the menu was the 'smoke stack' - your selection of bourbon or whiskey with a touch of maple syrup and your choice of wood to infuse a bit of smoke into the drink. \u000a\u000awhile we didn't try the food, the bartender did encourage us to come back and try the bugers, advertising that they were pan seared in several varieties of rendered pig fat. the appetizers sounded quite good as well, along with things like truffe oil and gorgonzola fries, and several jerk-seasoned items.\u000a\u000athe service was outstanding, especially given that they had only opened a day before. they were certainly well-staffed for it being early in the day, and the bartender was nice enough to talk to us about the place and how many of the items on the menu are made. the prices were on the above-average side, with both cocktails and burgers being in the $10+ range, and beers being in the $5-7 range. as i said, no happy hour just yet, but stay tuned - i'll certainly be returning to try the food(and more drinks!).

Vhow do i put this?  how do i describe this place?  how am i suppose to use words to convey this experience?  omgdeliciousscrumptousfingerlickingtrendylookingcomfortableanddidimentiondelicious!!!!!!!!!  i think that may cover it.\u000a\u000athis place seems to have a theme for people coming in.  you walk/drive by, see the front of the building, think to yourself 'what is industry public house,' throw it in reverse, and venture in.  this is one of those places that you are happy that you entered it.  the feel is industrial like in there, with the pulley system used for lighting, exposed brick, steel beams used for some of the hightops and the dark wood accents just right.\u000a\u000awe were greeted and seated by the general manager.  first time i was ever at a restaurant and the general manager actually introduced himself and brought us our drinks.  big thumbs up for you sir.\u000a\u000ait took a while to browse the menu, but they were happy to let us do that, the staff was not there to rush us in any way.  when we finally decided on what we wanted it was a breeze after that.  ordered the build to order nachos for the appy, so fresh, so good, so mouthwatering.  the mixture of food on that one plate alone was enough to convince me that this was a repeat place for me.  and we haven't even gotten to the main fare yet.  back to the mixture of flavors, i had no clue black beans and pineapple could taste so good together...ok, i'll stop about that already.  onto what i ordered for my main course, since it was lunch time i opted for one of their burgers.  i chose the farmed out burger.  the prochetta and bbq sauce was amazing, not to mention the wild boar bacon.  the bun being toasted was amazing, fresh lettuce, tomato and onion...i did not need to add anything to this burger, just a napkin to catch the overflow of flavor.  the order of fries that come with it says 'fresh cut...'  i know what you are thinking.  but these were truly fresh cut...reminded me of potato patch fries in kennywood.  the taste was just so good, can tell they are not frozen at all.\u000a\u000agoing for lunch here on a saturday was an excellent idea.  wasn't packed, staff was very friendly, and we could take our time in there without being rushed.  i also love the way they serve the water to you in a corked glass bottle, and they leave it for you so you don't have to wait for the inevitable moment when your mouth is full and the waitress asks if you need anything.\u000a\u000ai'll definitely return here, maybe in the night time to check it out and see what crowds are like for the bar.

Vmy husband and i traveled to industry looking for dinner, but we arrived during happy hour so decided to go for the specials.  we shared veggie tacos and a nacho plate, which were just "meh."  the nachos had fresh jalapeos on them and were so spicy.  they were good, but nothing special.  same with the tacos...just ok.\u000a\u000athe drinks were worth coming back for, but not really on special for happy hour.  (that's weird, right?)  the husband had a smokestack, which is so cool--they actually infuse smoke into whiskey with a flaming wood chip.  (don't try this at home, kids.)  i had the industrialist, a cherry-infused bourbon, which tasted mostly of regular old bourbon to me.  i wouldn't get it again.  we'd definitely go back for drinks, probably not to eat--and next time, i'm so getting that cake drink.  it looked amazing at the table next to me!

Vi've been to industry public house a few times.  the drink selections are great, and the food is good.  there are so many places to go that have great food, so this place is not first on my list of places to go by any means.  it's noisy inside, but that may be because this place is usually packed.  overall, industry is worth trying, but there are better choices, especially for food.

Vthis was my first time coming here. to vacuum your car, you have to use tokens. the token machine takes ones, fives, and tens. after i vacuumed my car, i went through the carwash. i paid $10 for a basic wash and an underbelly flush. the staff were pleasant and helpful.

Vthis is as good as it gets pittsburgh.  if you are looking for a nontraditional activity to do with your family or friends, you need to check this place out.\u000a\u000ato say i had a blast while i was here would be an understatement.  i had so much fun that i cannot wait to go again.  from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated with so much kindness from the owners that it makes you want to run out and tell everyone what you were just doing and urge those people to experience paint monkey for their selves.  \u000a\u000aeverything is set up for you when you walk in.  everything from the paint and right on down to a name tag for you.  they take into consideration if you are attending as a small group.  my group consisted of four people total and they had us seated across the table from one another.  making it easier to chat while we painted the night away.\u000a\u000athis is a byob establishment...bonus.  bring your favorite drink and have a few while you master that bob ross 'happy trees.'  \u000a\u000aoh, yeah, you know this is going to be a good place when you walk in and see the "people love us on yelp" sticker on their door.

Vthis is the perfect place for a gathering of friends, date night, or family time (if  21+). if you're with a group, just shoot pm an email and they'll seat you all together. everything is set up for you when you arrive so you can relax and sip your wine or libation of choice. once you start painting  the instructor will come around and offer tips or help out if needed.\u000a\u000athe owners are uber friendly and do everything they can to provide a welcoming, fun environment and encourage creativity.\u000a\u000ai absolutely enjoyed myself, my friends had fun and we all left with a great painting.

Vargh!  doesn't matter what time of day i stop here for either gas or pick up something quickly, it's a disaster.\u000a\u000ai always end up hearing about how some panhandler just had a birthday and needs some absurd amount of change in order to get back to the house they are staying at.  they are like flies there, once you get out of the car they cling to you.  i always tell them i don't have it, even though i catch myself jingling my change at them as they walk away as if i'm taunting them.\u000a\u000aanyway, prices for gas here are the same as any other gas station in the area.  selection of items at the window is limited to cigarettes and generic looking ipods.\u000a\u000astay away.

Vi have to agree with rachel--the atmosphere is fantastic, and the food (and in my experience, service)--not so much.  this place is beautiful--exposed brick, modern styling, dark woods, candlelit.  picture-perfect date night material.\u000a\u000amy husband and i walked in spontaneously and sat down at the bar five minutes before the end of happy hour, and the bartender gave us major attitude when we ordered off the hh menu.  (chill, dude! five minutes is five minutes!  the next round will be full price!)  we also split a flatbread and an appetizer, and there was really nothing special about it at all.  the chef was watching us eat from the kitchen door and he made me feel guilty for not enjoying the food.\u000a\u000ai also had to ask for them to turn their one television to the pens game, and got attitude for that request as well. (it's a hockey night!!  this is pittsburgh!!)\u000a\u000ai don't think i would come back unless i wanted to chat over drinks with the husband or a friend.

Vmarvelous food and excellent service.  sienna is mostly a small plates restaurant with delicious italian cuisine.  we shared a beans & greens appetizer that came with a chianti reduction sauce that was delicious.  i had the homemade gnocchi, which i am generally picky about, but these were fabulous.  my date had the chicken picatta, which was prepared with crimini mushroom, fried red skin potato, caper, lemon, and parsley.  excellent.  also, i got a mozzarella stuffed meatball that was very tasty.  lovely outdoor dining that spills out into historic market square, i am recommending this restaurant very highly.

V2.5 stars, leaning towards a 2 based on the price.\u000a\u000awent on a wednesday night at 7, with reservations.  got there fifteen early, got seated on time.  the front of the restaurant is *loud*; with a waiter talking to the table next to us and a somewhat unpleasant pair on the other side of us, the noise was a factor here.  got much better when the waiter wasn't dealing with anyone.\u000a\u000aanyways, it's a loud restaurant.  that's by no means a dealbreaker, and really common for downtown.  crowd was mixed, the most represented group there when we were in were 50-something guys wearing polo shirts, half tucked into khakis.\u000a\u000athe food:\u000a- i had the pork, which was decent, my wife had the gnocchi, which was good, but more doughy instead of melt-in-your-mouth.\u000a- we had the bruschetta, which we were told took 12 minutes.  (weird to be that precise, but ok).  some other waiter/waitress apparently swiped ours... so it took nearly half an hour, as our waiter thought someone had already brought it to us.\u000a- salads were good; aces.\u000a- my wife asked for a meatball with her gnocchi, which they forgot; it came about ten minutes late, and warm, but not hot, which left us wondering if they finished cooking it.  the meatball?  not all that.\u000a- portions were fine dining, and not red-sauce-stuff-your-gullet; i liked the portions, and left pleasantly full.  \u000a\u000aservice:\u000a- good, but with us having a very quick set of orders when we sat down, it took 45 minutes to get the first of our food... which was an hour after we first showed up.  ouch.\u000a\u000aso, the food was decent, but not as good as some other places around town at the same (or lower!) price points.  either the service or the kitchen botched this one, and for "restaurant of the year" and at a premium price... yeah, that sinks it.\u000a\u000a(we spent $100 after tip; two entrees, two salads, one appetizer, no booze.)\u000a\u000afor better red sauce italian, i'd try lydia's in the strip, and save a bit of money.  for better italian, especially gnocchi, i'd go to dish osteria in the south side, and still save a bit of money.  if i hear good things, i'd be glad to check back here, but we left disappointed on our first trip.

Vwigle(pronounced wiggle, though they admit it probably shouldn't be) whiskey is a young whiskey distillery - having produced its first batch just over a month ago - named after a pittsburgh revolutionary who wasn't ready to let tax get in the way of his whiskey. there are two aspects to this review - the whiskey itself, and the distillery itself.\u000a\u000athe whiskey: \u000a\u000awigle whiskey is the first(in modern day terms) liquor to be distilled within the city limits of pittsburgh(clique is distilled abroad and boyd and blair is located in glennshaw). due to the young age of the distillery, they currently only sell a white whiskey, that is,  a clear whiskey that has not touched oak barrels. if you are a fan of the familiar dark and golden browns and oak flavor of your standard aged drink, fear not. they are currently aging whiskey, but you can also buy mini barrels($50/1lt $60/2lt) of the stuff and diy at home. i love this idea - whiskey does not age in a glass bottle(your 3-year old 15 year scotch did not just double in value), so buy one of these to mark special occasions(ie births) and celebrate with them much later.(disclaimer - i am not exactly sure what the upper aging limit on american whiskeys should be, nor am i sure how much would evaporate after several years in a small barrel.)\u000a\u000athey currently sell two varieties - a wheat and a rye, and both are made entirely organic(though they are without label while they complete the paperwork), from locally sourced grains(except for the small amount of barley, as i learned on my tour), and from scratch - starting with several bags of whole grains. the wheat whiskey is smooth tasting, slightly sweet with only a bit of burn going down, smelling freshly of yeasty bread. the rye is a bit bolder and not as sweet, but still has a great flavor. the wheat for me is my favorite, but i wouldn't really sip either of them. cocktails are what i think these do best in, where the flavors come through but there is no age to overpower the other ingredients. at the store, you can sample both and pick our your favorite. \u000a\u000aat just over $30 a bottle, i think that you're getting a great deal. to purchase this whiskey, you have to go right to the source. they're happy with it that way, since they aren't sure they can meet plcb quotas, and they would rather talk about it themselves than have their name defiled by a random w&s employee.\u000a\u000athe distillery:\u000a\u000athe distillery itself is small, a tiny warehouse, one set of large machines to create whiskey, a small store at the front. the place obviously had a designer in come through: the design reminds me very much of the glass lofts in garfield. the ceiling has bottles embedded in it, a nice touch. the store offers free tastings and even cocktails for only about $5 - and they are delicious, even if you don't think you're a whiskey person. apparently, you can also send in your own wigle cocktail recipe and they might feature it, inviting you and your friends in to the distillery for a round.  \u000a\u000athey do tours and cocktail classes here, both can be signed up for on the website - the tours are $20/pp and come with tastings, cocktails, and  light snacks. again the place is small, but the tour was definitely extremely informative - you get to see, feel or smell just about every step of the process of whiskey making. the gains, the flour, the strong methanol in the first output of the still, the fresh and tasteless ethanol alcohol of the "hearts", and the "tails" - the flavorful part, the char on the inside of the barrels. at the end of my tour i felt like i was ready to compete with them, look out! \u000a\u000aadditionally the tour has a historical aspect. western pa was home of america's favorite sprit just after the revolution, rye whiskey. wigle himself had a distillery which he fought hard to keep from being taxes, resulting in the whiskey rebellion and eventual flight of whiskey producers from pa to kentucky - where corn grew in abundance and the spirit of choice for americans everywhere switched from rye to bourbon. the tour goes much more in depth into wigle's story, but i don't want to give it away. needless to say, it's riveting, and integrates very well with the tour. the whole tour lasts about a half hour.\u000a\u000ai have not been to a cocktail class($35), but i do know that they feature some of the best names in pittsburgh cocktails. verde, andy's, meat and potatoes, union pig and chicken, salt of the earth, and drinksburgh(a blog about - guess what) are all places where class instructors have hailed from, and you can see many of the creations on their website. \u000a\u000a-\u000a\u000aall in all, wigle is an excellent spirit and excellent new addition to pittsburghs fast-changing cocktail landscape. be sure to stop by, have a taste and maybe learn a little bit about whiskey and pa history while you're at it.

Veven if you don't consider yourself a whiskey fan, i would highly recommend taking the tour. not only will you learn how whiskey and other spirits are made, you will also learn the history behind distilleries in pennsylvania. haven't you always wanted to know why there's a noose on the wigle logo? this is a family run business, and the owners seemed very friendly and knowledgeable. i like the fact that they use locally sourced grains, and the resulting product is also quite drinkable. :-) they offer five dollar cocktails every evening, and the one which i tried was delicious.

Vi want to write about wigle as an event space.  the owners have held countless fundraisers and events for local non-profits, and they are superb hosts.  their tours are informative, and i like that it's a good space for acoustic music and that the crowd can spill out into the parking lot if it is a nice evening.  the staff is really helpful and it's a festive and fun place to be.\u000a\u000aas far as the name wigle goes, many would be happy to learn the distillery is named after phillip wigle, who's confrontation with a tax collector help spark the whiskey rebellion.

Vlittle caesars how i have missed you.  after your blow up and implosion in the american heart, it's been hard to find one of your locations outside of a kmart.  i'm so happy to have found you again.\u000a\u000aa convenient carry out location.  awesome if you have a craving for pizza and $5 in your pocket.  walk in or call ahead.  if you do walk in you may have to wait a minute for a pizza to come out of the oven, which even if you have to wait, there shouldn't be anything to complain about, it's nice and hot.

V"it is what it is"\u000a\u000ai really despise that mantra, but i feel it's appropriate in this context. you go in,  grab a pizza, pay $5.35 and you're off. \u000a\u000ait's cheaper than ordering one and it's cheaper than picking up a frozen pizza from the grocery store. \u000a\u000athe 2 worst things that can happen to you are; you have to wait 5 minutes because they don't have any in the hot box (that what i call it) or they're out of your favorite dipping sauce.\u000a\u000aa little caesar's hot 'n ready is great for you and a co-worker or 2 share on a lunch break for just a couple bucks.

Vi have sampled several dishes from katana and none of them disappointed. i usually get take out or delivery which is quick and always on time. my only complaint is with the moo shu vegetable dish, it is supposed to come with chinese pancakes but come with flour tortilla shells instead.\u000a\u000aother places do the same, but i expected better from katana.

Vamazing!  we stopped for breakfast this morning and i was very impressed.  the decor is very classy; it almost feels you stepped into a ny deli or something.  wood counters, huge thick cutting boards displaying baked goods, jazz playing, and artfully written chalkboard menus on the wall.\u000a\u000athe coffee is good, and the breakfast sandwiches are better.  i had local fried egg + cheddar on a pretzel roll, which to my delight was huge and came with fresh lettuce and tomato.  for $4?!?!  take that, egg mcmuffin.  the husband had pastrami cured salmon and cucumber on an everything bagel.  he said it was awesome.\u000a\u000awe will definitely make more breakfast stops here, but i'm also looking forward to trying lunch.  everything on the menu looked so delicious, plus they had pumpkin pecan bread pudding...couldn't bring myself to order it for breakfast, but i'm going to have to try it someday soon!

Vin the movie "chef", jon favreau plays carl caspar, an executive chef who gets fired after a video of him berating a food critic goes viral.  so he buys a dilapidated lunch truck, renovates it, and starts selling the most amazing cubanos.  thanks to social media, his lunch  truck becomes a huge hit.  the movie features so many mouth watering close-ups of  delicious food being made, i almost cried into my $8.00 box of popcorn!\u000a\u000aand i've had a hankering for a good cubano ever since.\u000a\u000aand now i've found one, thanks in part to yelper dj j. 's sandwich list and review.\u000a\u000ai haven't had many cubanos before, but this was that perfect blend of ham and  pork belly, served on a yummy carba-licous  ciabatta roll.  i know a sandwich is good when i want to slowly savor each bite rather than wolf it down.  and what better way to top off a cubano than with a nice cup of fair trade coffee?\u000a\u000ai think next time i come here i'll try the pain bagnat.  or maybe i'll come for breakfast and try the pastrami cured salmon.\u000a\u000abut in the meantime carl caspar (jon favreau), you and your lunch truck have met your match!

Vhmmm!  looks like my review of the racer was somehow merged into my main review of kennywood park.  so here it is again.\u000a\u000athe racer is kennywood's second oldest rollercoaster after the jack rabbit. built in 1927, it's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster. what's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster? well it's a racing coaster that appears to have two continuous loops (ala the american eagle at six flags or the gemini at cedar point), but really has only one continuous track. so you end up on the opposite side of the station from where you started. there are only three remaining coasters of this type in the world. the other two are in mexico city and blackpool. \u000a\u000athe racer was designed and built by john miller and its trains are classics built by the philadelphia toboggan company. ptc built some of some of the most famous coasters and their trains. its tallest vertical height is 76 feet, its maximum drop is 50 feet, and its top speed is 40mph. of the three woodies at kennywood (this, the jack rabbit and the thunderbolt), the racer is the only one in which the initial hill is also the lift hill. when built, it cost the then-princely sum of $76,000! imagine what the designers back then would have thought of what the newest coasters cost! \u000a\u000aready to take a ride? \u000a\u000aokay, let's get on the train on the right! it doesn't really matter where we sit on this one, so maybe we'll just park in the middle. the alarm bell rings, the brakes are released and we begin rolling towards the lift hill. we won't see our opponents until we're almost on the lift hill. the lift chain catches and we're inching our way up the hill. we're about a foot in front of them. we see the warning sign as near the top telling us not to stand up. well duh, but i'll bet some moron has tried that! \u000a\u000athe lift chain releases and we we're down the first drop, then a quick ascent, then a reverse curve. because we're on the inside of the curve, we pull out to an early lead. uh oh, that can't be good. read on. we keep our early lead for awhile but remember, sometimes we're on the inside curve, sometimes on the outside. the great thing about the racer is that some of the curves are so tight, we can reach out and high-five our opponents.  remember, it's not a tradition--it's a requirement! \u000a\u000athe present racer replaced an earlier one built in 1910, which was a side-friction coaster like leap the dips at lakemont park. the present racer's cars are locked to the track, thus allowing banked curves as well as dips on the curves. we can see how this has come into play 'cos even though we've been ahead, on the final curve our opponents have pulled into a late lead and are first back into the station! \u000a\u000ashite! we lost! \u000a\u000athe racer really doesn't have the g-forces or the airtime hills of the jack rabbit or the thunderbolt. it doesn't have the thunderbolt's speed or wicked drops either. but it's still got a great rough ride and it's still a blast. the racer is an ace (american coasters enthusiasts) classic and on june 21st, 2010 the racer was declared an ace coaster landmark.

Vpittsburghers love their local traditions, and for many of us, there's nothing better than a trip to gus and yiayia's on a hot summer day.  gus kalaris and his wife, stella have been selling hand-shaved ice for decades, and the stand dates back to 1934 when it was operated by gus' father, george.  don't delay, make this part of your family tradition, it's one of life's simple pleasures, and a connection to pittsburgh's past.  the prices are more than reasonable and the product is as authentic as it gets.

Vfairly similar to the other location in brookline. basically, what you have is a small mexican grocery store with reasonably priced produce and other goods. outside on the sidewalk, during select hours, they run a small taco cart with pork and beef options. each taco consists of two corn tortillas with a generous helping of meat, and then you get to add your own toppings and salsas. no vegetarian options here, and nowhere to sit outside. most people seem to just stand around on the sidewalk and eat.\u000a\u000athe tacos are cheap and authentic. it's definitely a hole in the wall experience, but quite tasty.

Vthis is a cute little thai restaurant, which surprised me because for some reason i thought it was going to be an indian restaurant! it's a good thing i like both thai food and indian food. the wait staff was friendly, and the restaurant seemed clean and modern. on friday and saturday nights they have live music while you eat which was a cello and guitar duo the night we were there. i tried my standard, chicken pad thai, which was good although not my favorite in town. my dining companion got the green curry with tofu which was one of the better ones i've had in town. all in all, a good experience and which places it in the top three thai restaurants i've tried in pittsburgh. although i've only tried this location once, i will be back.

Vi'm so glad this place opened in oakland.  there aren't many places to get a great salad, and the existing choices prior to hello were $$$$.  the only strike i have against this place is that they are too busy for the staff that will fit behind the counter, but i guess you really can't fault them for that.  the manager was chopping my salad and admitted they were not prepared for how busy they've been--not sure why, as pitt's medical, nursing, and public health schools are all right around the corner--not to mention the three large hospitals!  there are some health-minded people that have been deprived of health restaurant choices for quite some time...\u000a\u000aanyway, the food.  i did the "create your own" salad, where someone walks you through the bar and adds veggies, cheeses, and proteins at your instruction.  they then add a dressing, mix it all up, chop it, and fill a to-go container.  \u000a\u000abonus points for the "vintage" boylan's soda fountain--yum!\u000a\u000ai know i'll be back to hello bistro quite often once fall semester starts.

Vi really enjoy hello bistro. i could seriously live on soup & salad so i was definitely excited about this place opening. some may say the salads are overpriced, i tend to disagree. i can't go to whole foods or the co-op without dropping $10-$15 so $8 isn't so unreasonable and with toppings such as hearts of palm, artichokes, beets, edamame, feta, sprouts, garbanzos, etc... you can't go wrong.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is that the salads are about 85% lettuce and they only put one scoop of each selected topping.

Vi thought i was seeing double on the southside the other day, turns out, i was.  or maybe the place these two locations on the southside as a way to plant a subliminal message in your head so that by the time you reach the second location, you must have some frozen yogurt.\u000a\u000athis place is bright, i mean cheerful brights.  makes you rev up with anticipation for the flavors you are about to pick.  like a kid in a candy store, except your an adult in a yogurt shop.  of course you have hard decisions to make in here.  what flavor do i want?  do i want more than one flavor?  should i swirl it?\u000a\u000aand the toppings, oh my god, the toppings.  how do you choose the appropriate toppings to satisfy you need for delightful tastes on your tongue?  of course, i believe the spoons should be more like shovels to heap those toppings on, but that's just me.  i had to go up and down that toppings bar several times before i could make the correct frozen yogurt to toppings ratio.  \u000a\u000aof course after you weigh and pay you have another tough decision to make.  what color of spoon do i get?

Vthis is my go to atm when i'm in the area.  being a member of a credit union myself, it is best to stop at a credit union.  no fees!\u000a\u000aasides from that, there's nothing special about this place.  there is not enough room in the parking lot that is for sure.  if you want to park here, it's best to find a spot on the street instead of fighting with other customers for one of the spots.

Vwhat to say about a place where you can take care of two vices in one stop...amazing!  they have everything you need when it comes to alcohol or tobacco.  not to mention that the staff here are super courteous and overly nice.  they did a nice job on reusing the building (once a hook n fish), sad though, there is really no use for the patio off to the side now.  \u000a\u000abut if you are in the edgewood area and didn't want to have to fight your way to another place like this, it's very convenient.  be sure to check it out.

Vwe heard about this place from a guardian list of top cheap eats in edinburgh, so stopped in for a quick lunch after a morning of walking.  not too busy when they first opened on saturday, but i think they get very busy in the evenings.  \u000a\u000awe both wanted noodle soup, but felt we had to try the yakitori, as that is their speciality.  so we started by sharing the tsukune, which were amazing chicken meatballs.  one order gave us each one little skewer of three, so we got a good taste.  the sauce that glazed them was homemade, and really unique.  made us want to go home and google it and try to figure out the recipe!  then we each got ramen, mine with gyoza dumplings and his with tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet).  i preferred the dumplings, as the pork had a sauce on it that i didn't think worked well with the broth.  other than that, the dish reminded me a lot of wagamama only better - lots of yummy seaweed and abundant vegetables like carrots and leeks.  one soft egg in each bowl, and lots of curly ramen noodles.  10 for a bowl, so not the cheapest, but the ramen is great quality and felt very authentic).  it's a casual but sleek little place, a little too cold in there though!  very convenient location for a meal after doing touristy things all day.  definitely don't miss out on the meatballs!

Vemilia romagna is a new spot in the strip district still largely under construction, but with aims of bringing excellent italian food along with world-class cocktails and several distinct high-end environments to enjoy both in. it's a farm to table restaurant so the ingredients are all extremely fresh, with many herbs being grown on site.\u000a\u000awe arrived late on a friday night and the first thing we noticed: it was loud - there was a dj in the bar that you could hear very well from behind several brick walls.. but as it's the first week, i'm sure they realize the issue and we'll be the only ones fortunate enough to experience that. that being said, our plans of sitting in the bar fell through for hopes of saving our heads and ears from damage, so we opted to sit in the restaurant. the restaurant space is cozy, tons of exposed brick and a large wine rack on display with perfectly sized tables for both casual and intimate conversation. for being so new, the service was excellent.\u000a\u000athere are two distinct menus, and options from one are not available at the other. first, we decided on drinks - forgoing the wine menu in favor of cocktails - the ultra l and banana & basil(unfortunately the cream soda wasn't quite worked out yet). the ultra l($9) was extremely delicious - mint, chocolate, and lemon all combined in a smooth and creamy drink. the banana and basil($8) tasted like a banana popsicle, but not quite as sweet. \u000a\u000ai was excited for the food to arrive, i was just talking to someone about how i had always wanted to try alla famiglia and here was a production by the same owners. for our meal we decided to split two menu items - the caprese salad with fresh-in-house-pulled mozzarella($13) and mushroom risotto sans snails(they were very accommodating to vegetarianism: $15 - $18 w/ snails). the caprese was ultra-fresh, with heirloom tomatoes, balsamic, olives, and super fresh basil. the risotto had a strong earthy flavor, perfect tenderness, and a delicious hint of black pepper. as someone who doesn't eat mushrooms, i was happy to eat a ton of this dish.\u000a\u000ai'm not typically one to get dessert, but the waitress was able to tempt us with a mascarpone cheesecake with peach coulis and a graham cracker crust, and i'm glad she did. this dessert was absolutely fantastic, light(for cheesecake) and the peach coulis added the perfect balance to the dish. definitely one of the highest points of the meal.\u000a\u000aafter dessert we got a glass of wine($9) and another cocktail, the cocoa powder($9) - which tasted like a mexican hot chocolate with a ton of cayenne thrown in. this drink was extremely spicy, so look out, but it was never unpleasant. that being said, i really enjoy and eat a lot of spicy food, so your mileage my vary.\u000a\u000awe were checked on by the bartender and chefs and we thanked them for the wonderful meal. they let us know that in the future there will be two more sections to the restaurant: a beautiful lounge/dance bar upstairs with world-inspired shots instead of cocktails and a beach patio in the back. \u000a\u000aall in all i'm extremely excited to have this new option in the strip. for a nice italian dinner(something i don't usually go with) or a trendy bar, definitely make sure emilia romagna is on your radar - especially before there is a line around the block to get in.

Vi'm kicking myself in the butt for not buying the basically brand new shirt with the tags still on it in here.  and i doubt that by the time i get back here that it will still be on the rack.\u000a\u000athe clothing here is pretty expansive.  they have just about anything that you can think of.  short sleeved to long sleeved, jackets to jeans, even a few pair of shoes are here for your review.  they even have a clearance rack if that is possible.  \u000a\u000athe thing i like about this place most is that it doesn't emphasis the trendy.  unless what you view as trendy is retro.  even what they use to decipher the size of clothing is reused.  they use old 45 records to let you know what size is what.  \u000a\u000athe staff are super friendly and down to earth.  this place definitely warrants many return visits.

Vi really struggle giving marty's  2 stars, because i want them to succeed...i'm just not sure they can.  it's located in the strip where right by nature used to be, and although the people that work there say it's not the same thing, it is a very similar thing...and we all know what happened to right by nature.  the people at marty's are much more local and sustainably-minded, and do things like food tastings in-store, which is awesome.  \u000a\u000ai like marty's a lot--they have organic and vegan food, lots of specialty local groceries, all local produce, a caf, and a coffee bar.  the problem, as mentioned by yelpers before me, is that everything is prohibitively expensive.  $3 for iced coffee, $2 for kind bars i buy at wf for $1.50, and almost double the prices i regularly pay on a couple grocery staples like quinoa and jarred pasta sauce. (their bulk section is reasonable, though, to be totally fair!)\u000a\u000aalso, they are new and working out the kinks.  the first time i went, even though they had a very rad taco tasting going on, all the coolers were totally empty from a power outage--so i couldn't buy the jeni's ice cream i was excited about bringing home.  the second time, the coolers were full but they didn't have the one thing i was after (cottage cheese, if you were wondering).  i will give them one more shot in a few weeks, but three strikes--you're out.

Va couple of great things to check out are the bulk spices.  you can really get some wonderful deals hear, and you are not paying a lot for the packaging.  i love that the spices are housed in an antique card catalog.\u000a\u000athe other thing that is special is the cheese counter.  you can get some really excellent local artisan cheeses at marty's.\u000a\u000ai think where marty's excels is in their cafe.  really excellent food at very reasonable prices.  they have a creative menu and food you can rave about.\u000a\u000athere are also lots of special events and classes at marty's, make sure you get on their mailing list of check their calendar.

Vthis review is really just for the cafe, i didn't venture afterwards to the store part or coffee bar.\u000a\u000ait's a nice, simple, clean set up they have.  both indoor and out (they appear to be dog friendly on the patio/deck thing they have).  simple tables and chairs, some high, some low.  open area, no real separation from the store, and it was bright, so bright you may have needed your sunglasses indoors.\u000a\u000athere was a mix of food brought to the table.  unfortunately i wasn't able to try it all, but what i did sample was amazing.  i had a grilled chicken sandwich and some of their homemade potato chips.  also on the table was smoked turkey sandwiches, fresh made hummus with homemade pita chips and a barley salad.  \u000a\u000aanother nice little touch they have here is a person plays the piano.  it's no overhead typical radio songs drowning out the conversation.  it's a real live person playing songs you would have never thought to have heard come from a piano.  and it kind of makes you feel old when you hear something like boyz ii men played on a piano.

Vdon't fret my friends, i did not purchase anything here, just went in to see what it was like.  why would i purchase anything with petagogy across the way.\u000a\u000ai'm a bit amazed by how much of a full store they crammed into to such a small space.  everything you would expect to find in a regular sized store is in there.  adoptions, live fish, the vet, and all the animal supplies you can think of.\u000a\u000ai will say the staff were polite, even though i didn't purchase a single thing.

Vlike a kid in a candy store...that's precisely the way i felt walking into grandpa joe's. it was like walking back in time when candy shops were in every mall, everywhere. i thought they were a dieing breed until this little gem popped up in the strip.\u000a\u000agrandpa joe's has all of your nostalgic favorites in addition to today's sweet treats. i'm a huge fan of the $5 mix 'n match box. my box consisted of atomic fire balls, zots, frooties, jolly ranchers and runts. i'm always a little hesitant to put loose, unwrapped candy in my mix because i'm afraid it may be stale but my runts were fresh - easy to bite through the candy shell as well as the tart pressed powder inside.\u000a\u000athere is a little area in the back with a television and some seating which i thought was a cute, welcoming touch. willy wonka (the og) was playing when i visited with my mom, a favorite for us both. we probably would have stayed to watch it a little bit longer if we weren't meeting my sisters and that would have been totally fine with the employees who are laid back and friendly\u000a\u000agrandpa joe's is officially one of my strip shopping stops.

Vgreat prices, wonderful inventory, helpful sales staff.  you will always find an eclectic mix of furniture and some unusual pieces you won't find anywhere else. i bought a cricket bench here at a great price.  this is your best choice for used furniture in pittsburgh.

Vvery authentic french brasserie, great wine list, wonderful service.  we had mussels in wine sauce for an appetizer, then i had steak au poivre.  they sear the steak in dijon brandy in front of you, and the peppercorns are really tasty served that way.  my son ordered the coq au vin, which was very moist and delicious.  everything is prepared in the traditional french way.

Vthis place is just a bit annoying.  it's on the corner or a busy intersection where parking is way harsh.  entering and exiting is like taking your life in your own hands.  if you park in a spot be prepared to possibly sit for a while before you can get back out.\u000a\u000aas for the inside it looks like they have all the basics that you would find in a convenience store.  however when you go to pay it looks like you are standing in line in a prison commissary.  the staff when i have been here have been very nice and seem to know the local regulars.

Va wine bar with a sense of humor?  totally my kind of place!  this is not your typical wine bar, for starters there is outrageously kitsch art on the walls.  just about every tacky thing you can imagine, except no velvet elvis.  the music is the same way, very funny and charming all at the same time.  but what's really great is the wonderful advice and flexibility you get from the wait staff.  they spent a lot of time with us, discussing what we like and what they could offer us, even some things that were not on the menu, such as a wine flight.  i heard this place is women owned, and i think that is apparent both in the cleanliness and in the playfulness of the decor.  very hip and fun place to spend time.

Vi love me some good mexican food.  and this place didn't disappoint.\u000a\u000awe must have been here on an off night.  place wasn't too crowded so that meant we got stellar service from the moment we walked in the door until we left for the night.  for not being here before, the staff were patient enough to take time and point out a few suggestions on the menu before i opted for the pollo queso burrito.  the poblano/chocolate salsa that came with it, amazing.\u000a\u000aas we waited for our food to arrive, i browsed over their drink menu and decided to go with their take on a classic, a margarita.  typical margarita with the top shelf stuff, the first sip made me feel all warm and fuzzy, so i knew that meant the rest of the drink would do me good.  \u000a\u000athe wait staff were totally on point.  never faulting when it came to our order, even when i requested no salt on my glass rim for the margarita, she took it back and got me another.  she even had some time to chat with us as we waited for our food.  even when we were done with our food and requested to leave it there as we stepped outside, she was fine with that and ensured that it would remain there until we got back.  \u000a\u000athere was just one downside.  the table.  i mean i liked the way they looked, rustic and unique.  but cleaning them has to be a difficult task.  i only say that because when i put my hand down on the table i somehow got a piece of glass stuck in one of my fingers.  but our server came to the rescue almost immediately with a band-aid in hand.\u000a\u000aall in all, it was a great experience and i'm sure to return again.

Vthe rooftop deck is a nice touch in the friendlier seasons, but the food could be better. they have a decent happy hour with cheap mixed drinks, house wines, etc.. the chipotle salsa we ordered was good and definitely repeatable. the chips were thick and strong--perfect for dipping into guacamole, which was unfortunately subpar. the avocados must not have been ripe enough and were stringy.\u000a\u000amy fish tacos came on double corn tortillas which i approve of, with a side of rice and beans. the tacos themselves were only "meh" however, same for the rice. the beans were pretty good.\u000a\u000aoverall, my feelings are mixed about steel cactus. it has potential, but currently is just a good place to get a drink, salsa, and enjoy the nice weather. the food quality could use improvement.

Va wonderful addition to the local craft brew scene.  you will find creative beers brewed with skilled expertise.  the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  i was hoping to try more dark beers, but i will have to make a trip again in fall or winter.\u000a\u000ai love the ambiance and decor.  this place is a gem.\u000a\u000athey have their own parking lot.  there are an outrageous number of beers to try.  you can buy a growler to take some home with you.\u000a\u000ai took the tour, and i highly recommend you do that is well, because the more you know about how their beers are made, the more you will want to drink them.

Vit's nice to go into a place that was trying to capture the feel of a 1950s diner.  this place does it so flawlessly with adding in touches of modernization.  it's nice and comforting to be seated in a booth and have the staff there in a heartbeat to take your order.  staff was so over-the-top nice that you kind of didn't want to leave.  the only draw back i found with the place is that the music can sometimes be too loud and makes for a flowing conversation difficult.\u000a\u000ai enjoyed the endless soup/salad bar while my friend opted for only a slice of pie and some iced tea.  the salad bar was quite filling with their choices to top the salad with and their mix of different already made salads from cole slaw to broccoli salad.  if the night air had been a bit warmer we would have chose to sit outside on the patio.

Vi'm very pleased to report that this was the best meal we had in edinburgh, and it was my choice for my fianc's birthday dinner.  out of all the places we went in town, this is the one where we'd go back.\u000a\u000astarted off on a great note when we arrived bang on time for our reservation and were told that unfortunately the table wasn't ready.  yes, a great note, because just wait - they recommended a great bar for us down the street, said to come back in 15 minutes, and they'd give us a free bottle of wine on our return.  winner!  can't even be mad!  that is an example of fine service.  so when we came back later, we were seated right away, and given a bottle of the montepulciano which the (i think owner?) recommended.  the small restaurant was warm and dimly lit, and buzzing with people.  clearly the locals know what's up - this place is nowhere near the main tourist drag.  we felt lucky to be there.\u000a\u000awe struggled mightily over what to order.  it all sounded amazing!  after much deliberation, we started with crab, peanut, and caramel coated chicken wings (yes, crab), and then the 3 birds and beasts platter - basically the reason i'd made the reservation in the first place.  the chicken wings were amazing.  extremely crisp on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside, with gorgeous and exotic flavors.  reminiscent of thai or vietnamese food maybe, faint hint of fish sauce, but in a really good way.  a very inspired combination.  then the main event - a platter of pulled pork cutlet, star anise ox cheek, tomato cajun beef ribs, fried chicken, a big bag of fries, bbq bacon beans, mustard slaw, and 2 ketchups.  phew.  \u000a\u000athe pulled pork cutlet blew my mind.  it's pulled pork, reshaped into a patty and then i guess baked or fried?  it looks nothing like pulled pork until you stick a fork in it, then all the delicious meat comes spilling out.  it was incredibly tender and flavorful, easily some of the best we've had worldwide, including amurrrica.  the ox cheek was incredibly rich and aromatic - don't save it for last, since it's the richest piece of meat and harder to eat when you're full!  fall-apart tender.  the beef ribs were excellent as well, and the chicken was good though our least favorite of the bunch.  perhaps because everything else was so inspired, the chicken just didn't stand out?  but it was tasty though!  i just think boneless fried chicken is morally wrong.  the fries were hot, crispy, and abundant.  i also really enjoyed the sides - beans were made from black eyed peas and were delicious, as was the slaw.  both a nice accompaniment to the meal!\u000a\u000asomehow, we finished it all and managed to order dessert - the rocky road.  peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream (yes) with a big piece of chocolate studded with marshmallows, turkish delight, and shortbread (yesyesyes)!  so good you guys.  the ice cream blew my mind.  the staff brought it out with a little candle for my fianc's birthday.  i assume his birthday wish was to always eat food this good.  and it's really really really affordable for the quality.  like, stunningly.  not including our wine, we paid maybe 44 for the meal, if i remember correctly.  and the wine would have been only 20 if we hadn't got it for free.  that's a crazy price for an appetizer to share, a huge entree, and dessert to share.  given how pricey some places in the tourist area can get, for far worse food, as far as i'm concerned this is the place to be in edinburgh.  i don't think we will ever come back to town and not here!  it's worth the long walk (or short cab ride) from town, because everything is just knock-your-socks-off good.

Vi'm not one to usually go to a fedex unless forced to do so.  and that's exactly what happened recently.\u000a\u000ai had ordered an expensive item and of course i was not available at home for the signature verification of delivery.  they do have a nice little option at fedex that if you are unable to be home during their window of delivery, you can have it sent to one of these stores.  fine and dandy and all that jazz, and it's just what i did.\u000a\u000awhen i arrived to finally pick up my package it felt like i walked into a case of the mondays......on a thursday.  every employee there had that awesome 'i wish i were dead instead of being here' look on their face.  i walked to the counter, id in hand, and was still given the third degree for picking up my package.  i'm sorry, i didn't know you paid for it.  cheer up, it's just a job.

Vnot a fan.  for some reason, the food is worse and more expensive than the squirrel hill location.\u000a\u000aalso, the staff isn't very friendly, and the lines are usually horrendous.  there are too many places in oakland to eat for me to pay $$$$ here--for bagels, i'll stick to the squirrel hill location.

Vcustomized burgers are here! (for other options, consider burgatory)\u000a\u000aburgers are good and quick. size seems a big small, even though you order a pre-determined size patty. the burger is as good as you want to make it, depending on what you choose, but some of the ways where places can try to stand out, such as buns, weren't all that impressive. indeed, i often miss the fuddrucker's down by the waterfront for this reason; they had fantastic buns. (side note - screw you owner of pittsburgh burger company, for taking over the fuddrucker's location and then totally messing that up).\u000a\u000ai still think tessaro's has the best burger in town. but, to be honest, burgers are not my thing, so, in a pinch, stack'd is a perfectly reasonable place for a meal.

Va friend and i went to our first workout here last night. the staff are super friendly, and its a chic place, not to mention super convenient, if you're always zipping around to whole paycheck (otherwise known as foods) as i do.\u000a\u000ai'm not sure exactly what it was that we were expecting, but it wasn't... quite this. it's not an aerobic workout, in that the exercises utilize very small movements, so it's great for people with joint problems. but, we did hope that it would be more... ballet inspired. this seemed only vaguely related to ballet. \u000a\u000aso, the good: your muscles burn. both my friend and i are in reasonably good shape, and we were having serious issues with some of the exercises (in a good way). my hip flexors are still sore. so, if you want to focus specifically on your butt and thighs, this is an excellent workout for you. but moreso than a spin class? hard to say.\u000a\u000athe bad: the music is so loud, you often have trouble hearing the instructor over it. and, it is sometimes really hard to see what the instructor is doing, because they turn the lights down (maybe they want us to have a dance party vibe in there, i dunno). and, most importantly, for the amount of money they are charging, it just seems ridiculous how little hands on time you get from the instructor. since so much of the workout relies on technique, it seems like a waste to spend that kind of dough and not know if you are doing it right.\u000a\u000aso, if you're curious, i encourage you to try it out. take advantage of the free try out special that they are running. it may very well be perfect for you. i may try another class, but it's unlikely.

Vclassy act. i think you can see that the management responded to my earlier review in a very nice, non-defensive way. they now offer (who knows if it will become a normal thing they offer on a regular basis) fundamental courses for free, which i think is an excellent idea for newbies. my friend and i went to one last night, and it was really helpful in introducing us to the movements in a more instructed way. that we got a good workout from it was a nice plus too.\u000a\u000aso, i give them an extra star for adjusting to client needs. please consider keeping this class on regular rotation. i can't quite bring myself to give the full five stars because of the cost, but want to give credit where credit is due.

Va really nice place to take dance lessons, i don't think they are as hard-sell as most of the other commercial dance studios.  their open dances are excellent.  the main dance floor is somewhat narrow but has a really nice surface for dancing.  the studio offers a wide variety of classes, including west coast swing, argentine tango, ballroom, and swing.  reasonable prices.

Vnot going to lie; this place is not cheap. that being said, it has some of the freshest, best fish we have had since coming to pittsburgh. it's probably on par with umi in terms of prices for quantity, but at least it's not pretentious, and you get some very interesting fish (stuff you don't normally find elsewhere).\u000a\u000awe had the chef's sampler (the $38 one) with more exotic fish. and, since it was our first time, we were a bit upset, not with the quality, but with the quantity. we had four sushi, and five sashimi for that price. now, again, the quality was excellent, and the kinds of fish were interesting, so really, this is just a heads up about the expense so that you're not as surprised as we were.\u000a\u000aunsurprisingly, we weren't particularly full. we got two more rolls, a spicy tuna and a salmon avocado roll. and this is why we'll be coming back: the fish to rice ratio is wack. there was way more fish than rice in these rolls, and the fish are fabulous.\u000a\u000alesson learned: stay away from the sashimi (unless you're looking for some super exotic fish) and stick with the rolls. service is friendly, and because they don't have a license, they'll give you beer for free.

Vi so want to like this place, because i feel like we should be supporting new, inventive restaurants in the burgh. but the fact remains... every time i come here, i leave hungry. and when you've just spent like $30 pp (without any beverages), that just seems wrong.\u000a\u000afood remains quite tasty. if you have the time, i highly highly recommend the fish head. it is phenomenal. be prepared to get down and dirty with that fish head. the meat around the collarbone of a fish are some of the fattiest, tastiest stuff on the fish. imagine tons of toro, but on the head. definitely needs to be shared though. 3 people is ideal.\u000a\u000athey've wised up and have cut back on the amount of fish they put in the rolls. the rolls are now pretty standard sized, with not that much fish in them. the rice is well done, but it's no longer remotely close to a good deal.\u000a\u000aalso started charging corkage fees (no big deal, just wanted to clarify what i had down before).\u000a\u000aso... sorry fukuda. i like you, i like your personnel (although service can be pretty darn slow), and i like the concept. but that can only get you so far.

Vthis has to be one of the worst post offices i've been to. with only one or two windows open, the lines and wait time are unnecessarily long. the attitudes of the clerks range from rude to dry and service is not efficient. i wasted 30 minutes of life waiting in line yesterday  because there was only one clerk. the best thing i did was just to walk out instead of wasting more of my time.

Vfirst, a tip people, go elsewhere.\u000a\u000aalthough this is a large location, do not let that fool you.  i walked in and though it would be a quick stop so i could send out one piece of mail and what i got was a twenty minute wait in line.  the attendants at the windows were about as pleasant as a porcupine during bath time.  a simple smile can go a long way.\u000a\u000athe wait seems longer in here as the lighting is horrible and so dim that you feel as if you may be in line to see the principal.  and it doesn't help matters that you can see employees behind the window wondering around aimlessly instead of opening another window to get the long line to move faster.  i am quite certain too that the windows here at the desk are to deter you from hearing anything they say and vice versa.\u000a\u000awhen i went to leave, i probably looked like a lab rat trying to get out of a lab maze.  i attempted to open the "out" door and it was locked.  are you trying to keep me in to make my mood worse?  more than likely, i will go to another location next time to mail anything.

Vi must say, i am impressed by yogli mogli!\u000a\u000athe interior is bright and cheerful, towards the back there is a copious amount of tables and chairs, and everything is clean.\u000a\u000amost of the yogurt flavors were sweet, they only had 2 tart varieties - plain and raspberry. there are plenty of candy and cereal toppings as well as fresh fruits and popping pearls. \u000a\u000athere are 2 tables to sit at that are outside the store front. bonus points to the site for pitting out a water bowl for the dogs passing by with their owners.

Vhey, how come i'd never heard of this lace before?  i mean i've only been working downtown for the past 13 years!\u000a\u000aanyway, stone neapolitan pizzeria has a bit of an odd layout and it's decor is -uh- different.  the floor to ceiling windows provide a great view of point state park and much of the decor is made from recycled materials.\u000a\u000ai went for the genoa sandwich (mortadella, salami & cheese).   the mozzerella is homemade and it sure tastes like it.  plus the other ingredients were very fresh---no freezers or tubs here!  \u000a\u000ait's too bad i work at the other end of downtown and i don't normally head this way.  but if i do, i'm gonna try the pizza next time.

Vgood drinks, and the bartender recommended me two books on the subject that made good reading.  :-)  they're doing craft cocktails well; if you want a sazerac or a ramos gin fizz, this is a good place to try.  if you're looking for a long island iced tea?  wrong bar.  very much the wrong bar.\u000a\u000abizarre (and pleasant!) bar food.

Vi am a big, big fan of h&h! i don't recognize half of the ingredients on their cocktail menu, but anything i've ordered has been fantastic.  i love the vibe here as well...dark, but very modern and minimalist even though the drinks are totally old-fashioned, craft cocktail kind of concoctions.\u000a\u000ai like this place enough to go way out of my way to stop here even though there is a similar place in my neighborhood, so 5 stars it is!

Vvery bright with lots of great windows, this is a different kind of bar entirely.  the wait staff were all extremely attentive and friendly.  we ordered food from downstairs at union pig and chicken and it was delicious.  this place is clean, and delightfully fun.  if you go on wednesday nights, they have adventure bingo, a combination of trivia and bingo, and really a riot.

Vlove, love, love this little indian truck near soldier and sailors.  yes, it looks somewhat suspect, but the allegheny county health department blessed it with a green sticker of approval, so you're good to go!\u000a\u000ayou can get a decent sized curry dish and rice (or two pieces of naan, if you ask) for $4.50!  seriously can't beat that with a stick.  i love the daal, which changes daily, and the chana saag.  this truck is very veggie friendly. \u000a\u000ai usually come here once per week, more than that if they weather's nice.  definitely give it a try if you're in the area!

Vmy hubster and i have been on the search for the sub $15 meal, and we have found it at noodlehead! we like the new decor, and the friendly service. best of all are the (relatively) lost cost, but delicious noodle dishes. yes, they might be more than what you would pay at a divey place in oakland, but here, you are paying for ambiance and the convenience of shadyside.\u000a\u000aveggie options are limited to the three $9 specials. however, they will also do the chiang mai noodles with tofu, so keep that in mind. the hubster had the pad see ew, which he said was very good, and i really enjoyed the chiang mai noodles. not too spicy or peanuty. we'll definitely be back!

Vwow. this is my new favorite restaurant! i avoided trying it for a long time because it's cash only, and that's a hassle, but oh is it worth it! nice decor, pleasant atmosphere, small menu of tempting noodle dishes, soups, and apps. it's byob btw. i love that the menu is small enough, it's actually feasible to try everything ... after a few visits that is.\u000a\u000athe pork bun appetizers are amazing; maybe the best thing on the menu. we order them every time! i've also tried most of the other dishes and one of the soups. everything has been good, although i keep coming back for the kee mao and the pad thai. \u000a\u000aone of my favorite aspects of this restaurant is the ... wait for it ... reasonable portion sizes! finally, a restaurant that doesn't try to make you sick with the gigantic amount of food placed in front of you. the noodle dishes are just about what you'd want to eat for dinner, which is unbelievably refreshing. thank you. things are a bit spicy here, so be forewarned.\u000a\u000athe word is out on this place, so you may have a wait if you come on a popular evening (friday night). it would be nice if they'd accept square for payments and would use the nowait app to reduce wait times, but other than that, i have no complaints!

Vreally surprised that this restaurant changed hands, but it really seems to have improved by the sale.  the dishes are more authentic, and the staff could not be friendlier.  lots of great options to choose from, and the food was delicious.  i don't typically buy dessert, but i was tempted to try the pumpkin with sticky rice, and it was great. i very much recommend this restaurant.

Vthis is the best food truck in pittsburgh right now.  they have an innovative menu and really excellent food.  there are other cool things, like solar power.  \u000a\u000ai have tried the korean braised shortrib w/ kimchi, spicy jerk chicken, and the juicy pork and they are all excellent, but my favorite is the spicy jerk chicken.   great prices, most sandwiches are about $5.\u000a\u000athe pgh taco truck does a lot of community events, and i definitely appreciate all that they do.  \u000a\u000athey have everything going for them, definitely the food truck you want to check out first.

Vthe brgr truck is now parked at the parking lot across from the courthouse(forbes & grant) m-f, 11a-3p. this is a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene, especially in light of winghart's closing for renovations. the truck has a pared-down menu consisting of about 5 beef/veggie/turkey burgers(all around $8), 3 sides($3), basic shakes($4), and a few daily specials. interestingly, the truck has brought back brgr's old 'add foie gras to anything' policy - $12 extra gets you a slice of guilty decadence. \u000a\u000athe service on the truck is pretty quick, our burgers were ready in under 10 minutes from ordering, served to us in paper boat trays wrapped in tin foil. there isn't really anywhere to sit in the parking lot of the truck, so you'll need to have somewhere else to eat, especially in the cold. additionally, we went around 1pm and there was a short line of about 3 people. \u000a\u000afor more about the burgers you can read any one of the numerous reviews at the restaurant. the food here is identical, definitely not my favorite burgers in town. my burger tasted like it got an excessive salt rub - big crunchy hunks of salt were charred to the bottom of my burger, and while i like salty food, it was way too much, and overpowered the tiny bit of chipotle mayo. \u000a\u000amoreso than its food though, the brgr trck(ha) is important politically. pittsburgh's laws on food trucks are arcane and are inhibiting a lot of great businesses that are now operating only at events. you can read more about the effort to get pittsburgh's laws changed here: http://pghmobilefood.com/ . in the meantime though, brgr's truck is getting the word out that trucks can provide quick, affordable lunches, and increase the diversity of available food to downtown workers that would be otherwise unaware of these issues.\u000a\u000aso, go out and grab a burger and help pittsburgh catch up to other cities with great and vibrant food truck communities. \u000a\u000a\u000aadditional note: you can get the truck at your event/business for a minimum food purchase of $500 for the first 2 hours. more info on the website. cards accepted, too.

Vi had a bad experience at their east liberty restaurant but being the good christian that i am i decided to give their food truck a shot.\u000a\u000athe truck has a smaller menu compared to the actual restaurant featuring the following five different burgers:\u000a\u000athe average joe (lettuce, tomato, onion, with or without cheese)\u000afire in the hole (guacamole, jalapeos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, sriracha)\u000ashrooms (forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese, mustard aioli)\u000acease & assist (american cheese, caramelized onions thousand island dressing)\u000adaily brgr (the burger of the day)\u000a\u000ai had a average joe with bacon and fries. it was cooked perfectly and so juicy and full of flavor. it was absolutely delicious! the fries had that perfect snap to them also, crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.\u000a\u000athere was a long line but, it went pretty quickly. it's been a few years so i think i will give the east liberty spot another try as well.

Vbenjamin's is a new bar taking over brix's old space (and i believe by the same owners) after zoning issues caused them to close their doors. their menu is focused, offering about a half-dozen varieties of burger, some available as house-made veggie burgers, and gluten-free buns upon request. three sides and a few appetizers ranging from pretzels to pate are also on the menu.\u000a\u000athe space is narrow, with a large bar sitting on the right half and a handful of tables on the left. at the far end of the bar is where the cooking appears to take place, and beyond that in a separate room is a billiards room(and maybe more, i didn't venture inside). arriving on a saturday evening, there were a few sporadic diners, but plenty of space even for a large walk-in party. \u000a\u000ain addition to their full bar, benjamin's has a beer and wine menu - no drafts though, currently at least. their can/bottle menu has a few craft and local favorites in addition to common macro selections. the prices are reasonable, and their daily happy hours can make this bar a steal(4:30-6:30 - ranging from $1 pbr to $4 wine).\u000a\u000awe started off with the mini pretzels and truffle mustard($2). the truffle mustard was as it sounds: mustard with a splash of earthy truffle flavor that really comes through. i'm not sure it's my favorite truffle-flavored condiment, but it was tasty. the pretzels themselves appeared to be regular store-bought mini pretzels.\u000a\u000ai chose a burger with green chilis, salsa, and chipotle sour cream and a side of home fries($9), while my friend decided on an egg, bacon, and hot sauce mayo burger with slaw($11), both medium.  the food came quickly and immediately the first thing i noticed is that my burger was entirely raw. the server was happy to correct the error and did so quickly. in the meantime i had some of my homefries, which were good, but just homefries. i would really prefer french fries, but i'm not sure they have a fryer here.\u000a\u000amy burger came back warm and cooked to a nice medium. eating these burgers is a messy task - they are juicy to the point of excess and leave your area soaked. unfortunately, i found the flavor of the burgers to be lacking, and my toppings didn't really didn't add much. my friend agreed that his tasted a bit bland.\u000a\u000abecause benjamin's is new, i would like to go back and give them another shot, but there are a lot of places to get an excellent burger in pittsburgh, so they're entering a market with some pretty tough competition - especially if their menu remains as focused as it is. i do like their attempt at combining a classy atmosphere with spruced-up blue-collar food, but at some points it felt more like an identity crisis than a synergy. they appear to be working at it constantly, though, so i'm hopeful that in time, benjamins will shine

Vafter attending yelp's burger bonanza @ benjamin's i had to go back for an encore.\u000a\u000abeing that it was my daughter's birthday and that she loves burgers as much as i do i figured that, that was as good a time as any to make a return visit.\u000a\u000aupon entering we were greeted and quickly sited in a booth next to the bar.\u000a\u000athe wife and daughter both got a cream soda and i got a coke. we started off with the shrimp and grits for our appetizer. (byrd's mill organic corn grits, habanero cheddar cheese, brown sugar and butter.) my daughter doesn't even like grits but, she loved these.\u000a\u000amy wife and i both went with the candied jalapeno burger with pickles and lettuce and tomato and the birthday girl ordered a bbq, bacon cheese burger with lettuce and tomato. we patently sat and watch in excitement as our bacon fat home fries (onions & poblano peppers) were being cooked next to the bar.\u000a\u000ait was like christmas morning as our burgers were brought all at once to our table. i am so glad i went with the candied jalapeno burger! i ordered it medium and that's just how it came to me. it was super juicy and cooked perfectly! the freshly ground blend of sirloin, brisket & short rib was amazing and by adding the jalapeno cream cheese really makes the burger. it was so good! the bacon fat home fries were really good as well and complemented the burger to a tee.\u000a\u000amy other complaint was the bun as it missing something. it could have been buttered or something. the house made pickles were great also.\u000a\u000aour waitress was perfect the whole night and never left my coke or water glass get empty for long.

Vbeen wanting to try this place for a while. very happy i finally did and can assure you my return will be often. from the moment you walk in you are greeted by the staff and made to feel welcomed. \u000a\u000athe pricing here is great, my total here for the amount of food i got was better than most chains and enough for two meals. i ordered a 10 inch six cut pepperoni pizza with a lemonade for the drink. i picked this because i thought i wouldn't eat at much and i'd have room to try one of their ice cream treats.  wrong!  the amount of cheese put on the pizza was more than enough and really filled me up. i didn't even have enough room to get the free refill for my drink. my friend first decided to get half a meatball hoagie, but the staff directed him to get the special, a whole hoagie and drink for less than a buck more.  he also got an order of fries.  we were informed that they weren't even going to have hoagies when they first opened and just by chance started. once they caught on, the rest is history. \u000a\u000aeverything is cooked right after you order. and i mean fresh from the oven. even the fries go in the oven, no fryer here (healthy fries, yes please).  \u000a\u000ayou can tell this place is meant for the warmer months too, with a window to order from on the sidewalk. only four tables inside for indoor dining.  during warmer months i'm sure most people would like an ice cream treat and then go to frick park to walk it off.

Vi don't know why, but this store feels bigger and better laid out than other aldi locations.  maybe it's perception, or maybe it's because this is basically a brand new store build to fit into an urban landscape?  whichever it is, it's nice.\u000a\u000ai don't feel rushed when i come in here.  i feel like i can take my time to pick over the product i want and don't have someone next to me trying to push me out of the way.  this particular location seems to be clutter free and well organized.  no random products right next to each other.\u000a\u000ait is also bright in here, doesn't make going grocery shopping feel like a medieval task.  all the aldi product you expect to find is here, plus every so often you stumble upon a brand name item.\u000a\u000athe only downfall here is the register situation.  sometimes the lines will stretch back into the aisles and only then do they notice they need to open another register or two.

Vmy first trip to el burro, my neighborhood's new burrito shop/taqueria, was this afternoon.  i won't say much about the speed and service, which wasn't the greatest in the world, because it's really only their first day open to the public.  they had a "soft opening" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.\u000a\u000abut it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is fantastic.  my husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  it was gigantic. i got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being amazing.  i was surprised when i opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  we also shared an order of chips and salsa.  both are homemade.  seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  i think not.  heaven.  their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  i liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.\u000a\u000aright now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  however, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so i think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.\u000a\u000ai am so, so excited to welcome el burro to the neighborhood!  if you're on the north side, give them a try!

Vthe shrimp diablo verde burrito was excellent, and refreshingly not a huge gut bomb - the size was reasonable. in terms of tacos, i can recommend the shredded chicken, and carnitas, soft tacos; the potato one was basically a french fry taco which was too greasy for my taste (but ymmv). similar fare to round corner cantina, which is not surprising as the same people are collaborating on el burro.\u000a\u000ai'm excited to have a lunch place like this in pittsburgh, but wish it was in oakland instead.

Vlove this place. i don't often go to the north side, but when i do, i make a point of stopping over at el burro (or nicky's thai, if that's what i'm in the mood for). simple but excellent burritos that are better than the ones they serve at round corner cantina (same owners). no frills, but delicious.\u000a\u000ai'm a big fan of the shrimp burritos, but really, you can't go wrong with any of them. and very reasonably priced! definitely get the chips... they aren't necessarily freshly fried right there and then, but they are definitely fried on premises, and are addictive.

Vnot sure if the burro has gone downhill, or if i just hit it on an off night, but i wasn't nearly as impressed as before on my last visit. i had the shrimp diablo burrito, which i've had in the past, but this time it was just kind of meh. the carnitas tacos were still delicious however, and the guacamole is quite good. the chips are way too greasy in my opinion, but that's not super surprising since they're homemade. in the future, i think i'd stick to the tacos here, rather than the namesake burritos.

Vyou know what i enjoy about yelp?  finding something new to me in the city.  that's exactly what happened with this place.  i could have walked by this place a million times, and not noticed it.  in fact i probably just did that.  it's somewhat a tiny place in a room inside webster hall.  it's not at the front of the building on fifth, it is on the dithridge side, and there is really no sign to find it.  once you walk inside it feels like you are in a medical office building.  quiet is the sound, so thank god you can follow the smell.\u000a\u000amy coworkers wanted to order out again at work, and to them, it's ok to keep going to the same old places and getting the same old thing.  but not me, i was willing to go to a place if i had to to pick up something to eat.  whenever my coworkers suggest something, i head to yelp and do a search for nearby places, i wanted a deli, and that's exactly what i found.\u000a\u000athey have a menu on the site, so that made it easy to figure out what all we wanted.  calling the the order was pleasant as well, and working in oakland made it easy to get here in the allotted amount of time it would take for the food to be ready.  i arrived, parked, was walking to the door, and noticed a sign, on 8 x 11 paper, and the owner looking out the window with a smile on his face.  the smile continued as i walked in the door, and without missing a beat was greeted.  \u000a\u000athe food was ready, and being packaged as i entered.  the owner and his son were both in the shop and making chit chat with me.  i was asked how i stumbled upon their spot and told them i found them on yelp.  i was informed that i was the first person to come in their shop that found them that way.  they were excited by that.  \u000a\u000athe food, my god the food, was very delicious.  i opted for the turkey club with a side of cole slaw.  the sandwich was stacked high with turkey.  i really wanted to call it a turkey blt.  the bacon on this sandwich was cooked to the point that it basically melted on your tongue, the tomatoes and lettuce were quite fresh and the bread was toasted perfectly.  the cole slaw was prepared to perfection as well.  right up there with 'made like mom's.' my coworkers were happy with their orders as well.  \u000a\u000afew tips:  hours vary from day to day, check their website; if you are coming to pick up your food, park in the loading zone (you'll bypass a ticket by hoping you don't take too long picking up food), they do deliver, but only until 4 pm, first time orderers get a little extra something when you arrive.\u000a\u000aso people of the oakland section of the city, make you way here to enjoy some of the best deli fare pittsburgh has to offer.

Vwhat a "friend"-ly place to visit.  ok, enough with the puns, in all seriousness, this was a nice place to stumble upon.  out during a walk through squirrel hill last night, my friends an i decided to walk up forward and had no idea that this place existed.\u000a\u000aconnected to frankie's next door and owned by the same people, the noise kind of overlaps, but kind of plays off of each other really well.  also ignore the thumping from up above, you are below a bowling alley.  the inside is nicely redone with a bar that stretches along one of the the walls, with stools for seating.  booths line the other wall for comfortable seating.  fireplace with seating in front of it as well.  pool table in the front room to occupy some of your time.  a handicap bathroom sits off from the room that has the pool table and the other bathrooms are located downstairs.\u000a\u000athe staff was very upbeat and very polite.  asking for any type of feedback that you could give they were asking for and were prepared to pass it on to the owners to make this place better than what it is currently.\u000a\u000aprices for the drinks were not bad.  music last night alternated between karaoke, dj and jukebox.  wednesday and saturdays are karaoke nights.  dj stef is there on other nights.  there's definitely enough room in here to have a nice little time.\u000a\u000ai couldn't give this place five stars because the bathroom had a funk to it, like a drain was left open and you could smell the drainage pipes.  and they definitely need to expand the types of alcohol they carry, it was looking sparse behind bar.\u000a\u000ai would come back here again for sure.

Vgreat craft cocktails, featuring a lot of bourbon.  drink service is medium-slow, but that's mostly because they spend a lot of time getting drinks right instead of slinging bad drinks quickly.\u000a\u000athe door and windows are covered over; you have to look for it.  that has an enormous benefit; it's intentionally only visited by people who specifically went there, and the hordes of roving drunks in the southside miss this place entirely.  they seem to be sacking short-term popularity... for long term lasting power as a terrific little bar.

Vwhy have i waited so long to try this place?!\u000a\u000aone rare night while partaking in some carson street livations i walk by tootie's and noticed the short line out the door. i though of some of the yelp reviews of the place and decided to give it a try.\u000a\u000aonce inside i realized that it was pretty much a take out shop as there really isn't anywhere to sit other than one small table which was already taken. if you can't decide which meat to get you can ask for a free sample to help make up your mind.\u000a\u000ayour choices are four different types of sandwiches:\u000a\u000afamous italian beef (slow-roasted, shredded, seasoned beef) available in 4, 6 or 12" sizes. \u000a\u000ahot sausage (uncle charley's gourmet hot sausage) on a 6" hoagie bun.\u000a\u000atooties famous chicken (slow-roasted, shredded, seasoned chicken) also available in 4, 6 or 12" sizes. \u000a\u000aspecialty sandwiches which are a combination of two or more meats, available in 6 or 12" sizes.\u000a\u000asince the place is called tootie's famous italian beef, that's what i decided to go with. i went with the 6" juicy italian beef hoagie filled with italian beef, giardiniera, and provolone cheese. i flew home to eat it as the smell was intoxicating. let me just say that it was not only the best italian beef sandwich i have ever had but, one of the best sandwiches i've ever had period!\u000a\u000atootie's famous italian beef is a great sandwich to help you sober up after a night of bar hopping on carson street and is something different than going to primanti's which everyone does.\u000a\u000a i highly recommend this place. five stars!

Vi had a really amazing meal here and excellent attentive service.  there's an especially cute booth in butterjoint that is oh so cozy, but there are other great places to sit as well.  the food is mostly comfort food and it is cooked to perfection.  our waiter gave us lots of help in suggesting things to order, and he bent over backwards in making a drink for us that was not on the menu.  this place is a winner!

Vam absolutely stoked that pittsburgh has got its own dedicated ramen bar now. i think the only other japanese related craze we now need to get on is an izakaya bar (japanese tapas... for the most excellent small plate asian restaurant in pittsburgh, try tamari's happy hour... cannot be beat for price and quality). this place has all the right moves, and reasonable prices to boot. i know it might be sticker shock to pay $11 for a bowl of noodle soup, but these bowls are huge. and delicious.\u000a\u000aif you are expecting the more traditional fatty pork broth, you won't find it here, but that might be for the best, given your new year's resolutions. their broths are plenty good regardless, with a choice between shoyu (soy), miso, and plain salted broth. i thought the miso was a bit too potent for my taste, and prefer the shoyu. it has a subtle flavor that builds over the course of the meal.\u000a\u000aultimately, the ajo ramen is my favorite, even though it's not exactly "authentic." if you like garlic, you'll love this. and if you love someone who loves garlic, well... let's just say that you'll be safe from vampires after dinner.\u000a\u000aapps are relatively expensive, given the quantity, but the noodle bowls are enough for a full meal. staff is very friendly and attentive, although they can get a bit behind when they are swamped.

Vi like the ambience in this restaurant -- it's dark and subdued. for large groups, there's a huge table available in the back which is kind of communal seating. it worked well for our group of six although the stretch was a bit long for sharing appetizers. speaking of which, i would recommend the garlic edamame which was delicious. food wise, the portions are huge so prepare to split something or take leftovers home. i'm not exactly a ramen connoisseur, but i enjoyed my meal thoroughly and plan to go back again.

Vgreat new north shore bar!\u000a\u000asome co workers and i decided to check out this new addition to the north shore, it just opened this month and is located in part of the former firewater's north shore saloon across from pnc park. they are open daily from 11 to 2am. with about 20 flat screens on the wall they are a great place to catch the game. they offer a ton of different drafts and great specialty cocktails. my favorite so far is the thai coconut tea. simply delicious!\u000a\u000athey offer some type of drink special monday through friday. food choices include all of the bar staples, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, wings, sliders, fried shrimp, fries and much more. i haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet but, i can't wait to try some.\u000a\u000aall in all they are a great addition to the much needed bar scene on the north shore.

Vnicky's, one of the staple thai restaurants that is on everyone's top list of restaurants, has finally moved into their newest space - much to the joy of disinterested downtown diners who were sick of lackluster lunch locations. i had the joy of nicky's thai at being only a short walk away, back when i worked on the other side of the river. now being nowhere near, i would constantly crave food as flavorful and spicy as my old lunch haunt. and it appears i'm not the only one to take notice, the downtown nicky's is expectedly packed during the lunch rush - being pretty difficult to get a table between 12:00 and 12:45.\u000a\u000aentering nicky's, the space is comfortably decorated, but larger and less cozy than the north shore location. as far as i can tell, gone is the beautifully decorated patio which made the atmosphere really shine, i can only detect interior seating here(though i will update if i find out differently). the waiting area upon entering is narrow and sectioned off by some shelves - too small for a party to wait, and barely large enough to wait for your takeout to be brought to the front. this is probably the largest complaint of the place - the second group to arrive and wait for a table will inevitably be waiting between seated people as they dine.\u000a\u000athe restaurant is currently byo if you care for it, though i expect many lunchers can't take full advantage of that option. dinner-goers, though, will certainly find a downtown byob spot nice - but should utilize it while they can.. a full bar is being planned and the fate of byo is dubious. n/a drinks are standard fare for a thai place - hot tea, coconut water, thai iced tea. the cost here is reasonable, and depends on what protein you select. for lunch, veggie entrees are usually around $8, pork/chicken for $9, beef for $10, shrimp for $11 and mixed seafood for $12. \u000a\u000athe menu is quite large,  larger than i remembered at the north shore location. it comes on a two-sided flat board which is grouped into sections like 'curries', 'rice', 'noodles', 'soup', 'chef specialties'. it's difficult to go wrong on the menu, but ordering thai(or any ethnic cuisine) can be difficult for people, so some of my favorite items are the green curry, red chili shrimp, pad see eaw, and spicy noodles. there are appetizers on the menu, but be aware that each entree comes with a soup(usually chicken and rice) or salad, and a single crab rangoon off to the side. spiciness is usually requested on the classic scale of 1-10, but i have recently been experimenting with "mild/medium/hot/thai hot" for a more consistent experience. i always go with 10 or thai hot, and unlike the unfortunate smiling banana leaf, nicky's is not afraid to deliver - it is not for the faint of heart or delicate of palate.\u000a\u000a the food is really where nicky's shines. fresh and flavorful veggies that are crisp and not mushy, proteins that are full of flavor and cooked to tenderness, and sauces that burst with flavors full of spices and herbs, sweetness and spiciness. garlic chilies, coconut, ginger, thai basil, and countless other flavors permeate every bite, making each subsequent taste both irresistible and enthralling.\u000a\u000ai have gotten takeout here a few times with perfect accuracy(8 entrees with correctly labeled spice levels, protein choices, substitutions/omissions, and soup/salad choices) - but it appears that my penchant for spice may have kicked up everyone else's choices a bit by proxy. be aware if you're going to order a 10/thai hot dish to potentially order everyone else's dish a step milder than normal.\u000a\u000ain my opinion, if you enjoy ethnic foods, you've found the best dining option in the downtown area. look no further.\u000a\u000ai'm surprised to see so many reviews scolding nicky's for service before they even get a month under their belt. initially you could tell they were understaffed at the lunch hour - but i would expect nothing less from a brand new restaurant, especially in a difficult-to-plan downtown lunch area. there now appear to be more servers and the last time i came into the restaurant around 12:50 there were plenty of open tables - so i'll assume they've been fitting meals into a standard lunch hour.

Vi never thought i'd get into thai food, but yesterday was one of those mornings when i just plain ole forgot to pack a lunch.  i was getting a little tired of the typical burgers, hoagies, hotdogs, and pizza slices.  well a coworker suggested nicky's and indeed a few of my subordinates order from here quite frequently.\u000a\u000anicky's has some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  for about 8 bucks or so, you can get a complete lunch with either soup or salad.  i tried the chicken basil with garlic, eggplant, and a whole bunch of asian veggies too numerous to list.  the chicken was tender, the veggies fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  i'm normally a soup maven, but i tried the salad with the pineapple dressing and found it very refreshing.\u000a\u000ai'm not sure if thai will become my everyday "go to" cuisine, but nicky's was a nice change of pace and i'll recommend it for our next supervisors luncheon.

Vnicky's used to be my little secret.  but with a creative menu and a stunning garden, nicky's has really taken off.  it's a little harder to get a table there now, so it's smart to make a reservation these days.  \u000a\u000ai have had many wonderful meals here, the food is very good.  i particularly like the mango dishes, the scallops, the spring rolls and the curries.  excellent thai food in a beautiful setting.  i recommend that you eat outside, the garden is stunning.

Vthe food here is not very interesting.  there's no way to keep out the cigarette smoke from the casino, so that's a distraction.  i don't think i will be going back.

Vhaving been to the original franktuary location in the basement of a church downtown, and also having eaten from the roving food truck, i wasn't sure what to expect from this new location. in short, it's awesome. a surprisingly large and tastefully decorated space with high ceilings, church pew seating, and a full bar!\u000a\u000athis place is all about local. they have local breweries such as east end brewing company on tap, as well as cider from arsenal cider house. soon, they will be featuring drinks made with whiskey from the local wigle whiskey.\u000a\u000afood-wise, in addition to somewhat standard hot dogs, they have some amazingly creative options such as the fishfurter. yes, you read that right, a frank made from fish. toppings for your hotdog range from traditional to mexican to japanese complete with wasabi mayo. not feeling like hotdog? how about a salad with (optionally) a hotdog chopped up on top of it? if you're vegetarian, they even have a tofu hotdog. french fries are referred to as "boring fries" since the non-boring fries are made out of garbanzo beans (surprisingly good). you certainly won't be bored with the menu.

Vi'm a sucker for a good hot dog.  and with the options for hot dogs here, you can call me the hugest sucker in the world.\u000a\u000ai only just visited this place for the first time last week and i'm hooked.  in the two visits, i have had three of their unique dogs.  and all i can say is "oh my god!"  they are so good and so worth it.  each hot dog can be customized several different ways to your liking from the type of dog you get, to the bun it's on.\u000a\u000athe three dogs i tried were the pittsburgh, memphis and mexican.  all unique in their own sense and all righteously delicious.  the pittsburgh features a smashed pirogi and cole slaw.  the memphis features bbq sauce and potato sticks.  the mexican features fresca salsa, fresco queso and guacamole.  each mixes the different flavors perfectly.  and each satisfies just as perfectly.  each time i had a dog i also ordered the pomme frites with a different dipping sauce, i highly suggest you try the garlic aoili.\u000a\u000athe beer selection changes depending on what's in season.  and the selection must be a great when i was in, each time my first option was always gone.\u000a\u000athe warmer months allows for the air to flow through here.  the front has garage doors like opening that not only allows the air in, but the noise out.  this also makes for a good time as you can people watch.\u000a\u000atuesday nights are a great night to stop in here.  take in a game of "full contact trivia" while chowing down on some great food.  winning gets you either $50 off your tab or a round of free hot dogs for your table.

Vi have mixed feelings about this place, i've been to franktuary a few times now and have had some really tasty wieners and not so tasty wieners.\u000a\u000ai'll start off with the selections that fell a little short; i was super excited for a veggie corn dog and poutine (classic) for some reason i was just craving it and that's all could talk about on the car ride to lv. imagine my disappointment when i was served a burnt corndog and my frites smothered in a flavorless gravy. i made everyone at the table taste the poutine just to make sure i wasn't losing my mind and the verdict was the same. i never send food back but i wasn't going to eat that, our waitress took it back and offered me something else but i declined and it was taken off the bill.\u000a\u000anow for some highlights; i'm addicted to the garbanzo frites, my sauce of choice being thai peanut...such a lovely combination. the italian dog is absolutely delicious, i took it home where i added some fresh basil and was in hotdog heaven! kimchi balls may sound a little strange, but if you are fan of the fermented korean staple then you have to try them out.\u000a\u000ai prefer sitting at the bar and find the bartenders to be amongst the friendliest i have encountered at a trendy spot like this. there is also a nice selection of brews and signature cocktails.

Vi love chocolate and i absolutely love bacon. so when i heard that this shop sold chocolate covered bacon, i knew i had to make it downtown and try it out for myself. i bought two slices of chocolate covered bacon, a milk chocolate bar covered with bacon and two lolli cakes: cookies n' cream and toffee mocha. the chocolate covered bacon was heavenly! the milk chocolate bar was very good, but there just wasn't enough bacon on it for me.the lolli cakes were deliciously moist, although they did make me very thirsty after i ate them. i was not concerned about prices when i entered sinful sweets because all i wanted was the chocolate. however, this is not grocery store chocolate so the prices are a little high, but it is worth it.

Veco bistro is a decent place.\u000a\u000athey are part of parkhurst dining services which is part of eat n' park. they offer breakfast from 7am to 9:30 am and lunch from 11am to 2pm monday through friday. eco bistro is broken up into three cooking stations, pizza n' at that offers different types of pizzas everyday. sequoia grill, which offers breakfast items such as pancakes, sausage, eggs, omelets, home fries and breakfast sandwiches during breakfast time and burgers, hot dogs and fries during lunch time.  between the bread makes made to order sandwiches and wraps with different types of deli meats, cheeses and toppings. \u000a\u000athere is also a salad bar in the middle of the space were you can make what ever type of salad you want. there are also pre made sandwiches and salads in the cooler if you are in a hurry and don't want to wait. there is a smoothie station as well.\u000a\u000awhen eco bistro first opened the food was really good and the prices were more than fair now to the food is average and the prices are high. example $6 for a grilled chicken sandwich. eco bistro was added to the building for all of the pnc employee's at the other end so i guess it's better than the alternative, cool beans which is absolutely gross!

Vi should have known better to order from here after hearing that the people that once owned w.g. grinders owned this place, but for some reason i still ended up placing an order, bad mistake on my part.  they fooled me twice, so shame on me.\u000a\u000alooking at the menu i thought it was fun, the play on words they used really drew you towards certain items and made you wonder just how good things were.  i was really excited by this, but sad to find it led to disappointment on my part.  i decided on a small buffalo chicken stromboli from the shakedown stromboli's section and a small potato salad from the dark star deli salads section.  i don't think they are on par for other places in the burgh when it comes to portion to price ratio.  what i paid i expected to get a good sized meal.  however this was not true.  the small potato salad was basically a four ounce cup of potato salad.  that's the equivalent to one of those dixie cups you use to rinse your mouth out at the dentist office.  and the description says, and i quote, "just like grandma used to make."  not sure whose grandma puts a ton of pepper in their potato salad, but it wasn't mine.  it was overpowering.  i will give you props for letting the skins on the potatoes.  and the stromboli, shall we discuss this now?  red onions, pizza cheese, blue cheese, and buffalo chicken, served with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.  i expected a big honking monster in a box, what i got was a small greasy stuffed piece dough.  if i wanted a hot pocket i would have stopped at giant eagle on my way to work.  that's basically what this was, a hot pocket, all the filling basically slide to the one end.  and the dipping sauce...no where to be found.  also it says on the menu that all the stromboli are coated with a garlic/butter mixture.  that's fine by me, i'm a fan of garlic, but it was a weird taste combination with the buffalo sauce.\u000a\u000athe next thing that irked me after seeing my food was realizing that i spend a good chunk of change for such a little amount of food.  i doubt, actually i have told my friends, that i will never order from here again.  i can spend the same amount of money elsewhere and come out with a meal for two, possibly three days.  i'm not really "grateful" about this place as you can tell.  *sad face*

Vthe strip district, pittsburgh's home to most ethnic foods and fresh seafood, recently got a new neighbor - a restaurant serving up wood-fire grilled fare from argentina. i am not familiar with argentinian food, so i was eager to try it out when i heard about the place. the space is next to the 16th street bridge(near altar bar), so the cold weather had prevented me from making the hike up, until there was a nice warm break and i was finally able to walk up.\u000a\u000athe space itself is minimal, imagine a pizza shop - 70% of the building is dedicated to the kitchen, the remaining 30% is left to standing room. there are about 3 countertops to eat at, but no stools. on the wall there is a menu, written in chalk, separated into about 4 sections: small plates, hambre (hungry), salads, and con pan(sandwiches). there are 4 types of condiments in jars in the middle of the restaurant which are there for your tasting pleasure: chimichurri(herbs, oil, lemon), ajo(garlic), cebolla(onion), and pimenton(roasted pepper). gaucho also offers various ways to receive 10% off on different days. wednesday, show your facial hair(doesn't have to be real, ladies) - friday, show your fashion flare. \u000a\u000aso far i've had tastes of quite a bit of the menu - the vegetales sandwich($7, i think), two steak sandwiches(flank and ribeye, $10 lets you choose from any beef they offer), shrimp(6/$13 - 'hambre menu'), empanadas(beef, onion, and hard boiled egg, 2/$3), chorizo($5 - small plate menu), and a pollo sandwich($8). the empanadas were hands down the best that i've ever tasted(which should be taken with a grain of salt), the steak is incredibly flavorful and juicy, the shrimp were very large, with a sprig of rosemary stuffed into the back of each one and a lemon that was charred on the grill as well. the chorizo was full of peppery flavor and just a little bit spicy, and the veggie sandwich was piled high with peppers, zuchinni, and asparagus(my friend ordered without portabello). \u000a\u000ayou can also order two slices of oiled, grilled bread for $1. the bread here, a fresh ciabatta, is stunningly delicious, soft throughout and a crust that, while chewy, won't resist you as you bite into your sandwich. i highly recommend ordering the bread so you can try out all of the condiments. i'm a sucker for caramelized onions, so the cebolla is my favorite, but the ajo is a close second, with the others also being incredible. \u000a\u000ai've only gone around 1:00pm, and there is usually a short line, but i'm not sure how this place handles around dinner time, or during the lunch rush. i asked about catering and the chef said that one day they'll be able to. he also said that he dreams of doing a whole cow roast one day - a goal that i can wholeheartedly stand behind.\u000a\u000agaucho is a welcome addition, and i am sure i will find myself a regular here. if you work in the strip or downtown, block of some time and make the walk. if you don't, then drive down on the weekend or for dinner. their website sums it up nicely, "eat gaucho."

Vlove love love love!!!\u000a\u000amy husband and i ate inside here on the hottest, nastiest day of the year so far.  we were quite literally sweating our you-know-whats off, but despite that, gaucho is an awesome experience.\u000a\u000aeverything here is wood-fired and super delicious.  my husband ordered a steak sandwich and they offered him like eight different cuts of steak to choose from.  i'm kind of a veg-head myself and was delighted to find woodfired asparagus and caramelized onions on my salad. yum!  all their condiments are delicious as well--if you love them as much as i did, you can take home a jar for $5! :)\u000a\u000awe will come back again and again and again--it's byob as well, which we didn't know (plus we were there for lunch), and i know we'll be spending plenty of fall nights on the cute little patio enjoying delicious food and a bottle of malbec!\u000a\u000aseriously, so awesome!!! it's kind of off-the-beaten-strip-district-path, but so worth a try!!

Vsmoky, meaty, authentic food.  really amazing cuisine served up by a friendly staff.  i had the steak sandwich (rib eye) with potatoes.  there are only about 7 seats inside but also some tables on the outside.  the decor is nothing fancy, but the food is the real deal. i would give them 5 stars, but i had a half hour wait in line, then a 35 minute wait for my food.

Vwhat a fun way to spend the evening with friends.  we were greeted as we arrived and we were offered to make our own alien costume gear to wear during the show.  that got things off on the right foot, and the audience participation continued throughout the entire show.  much of the show is improvised, and there were some good laughs.  there was improvised singing and an audience vote near the end.  the ticket price is reasonable, and i like the byob (although you should be aware of a corkage fee).  the 10 pm show seems a little late for most pittsburghers.

Vwhat a pleasant surprise.  the thin man is not at all like a chain.  the owners are fans of thin man television/film series.  they serve delicious gourmet sandwiches, and the shop has a real neighborhood feel to it.  i saw several regulars enter the restaurant and  they were all greeted warmly.  i ordered the smash, and i will probably order it again, it was so tasty.  goat milk marinated chicken breast, avocado, alfalfa, lemon pickled green onion, on a multigrain baguette.

Vfinally, the new location many people have been waiting for is open! rose tea "express" is much smaller than the squirrel hill version, but still has several tables even though the focus is on take-out food and drinks. the menu is much smaller, but they appear to have the full complement of bubble teas, and a handful of lunch specials. the taro cake appetizer i got was delicious as usual, and the cold mushroom salad is worth repeating.

Vlet me preface this by saying that the rose tea location in squirrel hill is one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh and is consistently good.\u000a\u000aalthough i was excited when rose tea express opened on craig street, i have not been nearly as impressed as with the other location. the food quality seems lower - i may be imagining things, but dishes have seemed greasy and have come with too much sauce. additionally, the menu is a small subset of the menu at the other location, and is unfortunately missing most of my favorite dishes.\u000a\u000ai hold out hope that this will improve, but for now the small menu and subpar food as compared with the other location makes this a solid meh.

Vthis is not actually a coffeehouse, but rather a warehouse where they roast the beans for commonplace! it's located in the same building as the east end brewing company (beer), and offers whole bean coffee by the bag as well as samples of various coffees. this is a great place to pick up your stash of beans, especially if you want them as close to the roast date as possible.\u000a\u000aa few other items are also offered such as t-shirts, coffee scales, and other brewing equipment. in my opinion, these are the best coffee beans you can purchase within pittsburgh. since discovering this location, i've been drinking more coffee than i should because it's so delicious!

Vthere aren't too many places to spin in pittsburgh, especially if you don't belong to a gym.  this spin studio is on an upper floor of the building.  the prices i feel are reasonable:  $15 per spin class or a package of 10 for $135.  there are various instructors who are all pretty decent (note:  some have changed recently and so i am not sure about them).  unfortunately, most of their classes didn't work with my work schedule and i had to stop going.  weekdays, the classes start at 6:30 pm and on weekends, at 9 am.

Vlike darren, i think this exchange location doesn't have quite the extensive selections that some of the others do.  still it's pretty convenient being right around the corner from work and i like to browse here occasionally on my lunch hour.  i've found a few goodies here like wilco's "the whole love" and "kicking television" and uncle tupelo's "march 16-20 1992".  one of my colleagues was all agog having found "the simpsons complete 2nd season" for only $7.00.\u000a\u000aplus the guys who work here are pretty friendly.

Vanother great addition to the asian food scene in pittsburgh, which seems to be heating up! my husband and i were so excited in the months leading up to the opening, because i have always lamented the lack of really good, authentic chinese food in pittsburgh (although try sichuan gourmet for sichuan food, and orient kitchen for cantonese). when i heard that they had xiao long bao, i knew that i had to come. \u000a\u000ai've been twice now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself both times. while the xiao long bao isn't as good as those you might get at joe shanghai's in nyc or in la, it's probably one of the few, if only, places you can get them in pittsburgh. and for that, i give them immense gratitude for giving me access to one of my favorite things to eat. for this alone, i give them five stars. the potstickers are also very large and tasty. my personal favorite noodle dish is the noodles with minced pork. the noodles are perfectly tender, and every bite is just super tasty. \u000a\u000anow, do i think this place is as good as the places in nyc or la? no. but for pittsburgh, this is probably the best. so, for example, as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the braised noodle beef soup could pack a little more punch (in fact, i think ice tea taipei down the street might do a little better in this department. but if you're not familiar with asian food, i think ice tea taipei is kind of hard to navigate). part of the issue is that they are catering both to people who don't have a lot of experience with asian cuisine, while also trying to satisfy those of us who have expectations for what they should do or how things should taste. it's a fine line to walk, and i think that they do a good job of it.\u000a\u000athe service is friendly and fast, and i love the open kitchen. if you don't want to see how your food is made, go somewhere else. but for those of us who want to be in touch with those who produce the meal, the open kitchen gives you a great peek into what goes into each dish. come and try it!\u000a\u000ap.s. not super veggie friendly. they do have some options, but they are extremely limited. i hear that they are going to try and change that, but just something to keep in mind.

Vthis place is definitely about the noodles, and they are definitely first class.  the dumplings are also excellent.  \u000a\u000awhat everyone should realize is everyday noodles is taiwanese cuisine, so although it may not meet your expectations, if you are open to discovering what they have to offer on their own terms, you will be pleasantly surprised.\u000a\u000amy waiter was extremely helpful in guiding me through the menu and suggesting dishes that would appeal to me.\u000a\u000athe portions are generous, and the noodles are comfort food heaven.\u000a\u000ai love the decor, it's rather sophisticated and well designed.  this place is a great find.\u000a\u000ai'm ending with a tip.  try the sweet egg yolk steamed bun.  it comes with 3 steamed buns, so very appropriate for sharing, and oh so delicious!

Vmy husband is obsessed with anything wood fired - and since il p's location isn't far from our north side abode, we have been making frequent visits to this place.  the pizza here is really great--anything we have had (margherita, veggie, and something spicy i can't remember the name of) had been awesome.  their appetizers are great as well--the calamari here is up there with the best i've ever had.  i wasn't "wowed" by the salads for the price, but they definitely weren't bad.\u000a\u000athey have a decent draft beer selection and an extensive (italian!!) wine list.  most of the wines were unfamiliar to me, but the servers do a great job of helping you pick one if you let them know what you like.  the service here is pretty great in general, actually. \u000a\u000athis place gets really busy, so don't come here for a quiet date night--but it's busy for a reason.  it's a great place!!

Vthere are slight differences in the menu from the mt lebo location and the downtown.  but in general, you get the same high quality food made with fresh and authentic ingredients.  i liked sitting upstairs, away from the door, but there's nothing better than sitting outside when the weather is beautiful.\u000a\u000amake your reservations way in advance, this restaurant books up quickly, especially during the weekends.\u000a\u000ai particularly like the pizzas, but everything on the menu is delicious.  the wine list is also very good, i don't know that you will see a better italian wine list in the city.\u000a\u000aour waitress was very attentive and made some excellent suggestions for us.  she also did not hesitate to bring us a taste of a particular wine before we made our choices.  we chose the carpaccio di polpo as an appetizer and it was unusual and satisfying (octopus, lemon and olive oil).\u000a\u000ai like the renovation of the building, there was a flower shop here at one time, and they did a marvelous job of transforming the place into a fine dining establishment.

Vwent there last night, and tried the 6-course dinner with my wife.  chuckled when i walked in, as i said to her "the food here would have to be pretty surprisingly good to stand up to the soundtrack."  (they had on some pretty bombastic classical music.)\u000a\u000athe food easily stood up to the choice of music.  wow.\u000a\u000afood was easily the best i've had in at least a year; on-par or above any other place in the city.  all of the courses were great.  service was great.  have recommended this place to friends for special occasions, have recommended this place to coworkers for events, all around awesome.\u000a\u000aportions per course are small, as they're supposed to be if you're having six or more.  reservations suggested, even if they're not busy.  attire suggested as business casual.

Vi love the food and the service.  i also like that notion is currently a byob.  we had the 4 course dinner, and because we shared we were able to taste most things on the menu that evening.  the service was well timed and impeccably gracious. \u000a\u000athe ambiance was very muted and simple, i liked the art glass hanging from the ceiling.  \u000a\u000awe had a wonderful experience at notion and i would love to return in the near future.

Vi am loving this place. had no idea it was doing a soft opening (they officially open on 4/5), and wandered in. the decor is stunning, and has a great 1920s vibe. super high ceilings, great looking bar. it's located in an old bank (hence the fun name), which helps to maintain an austere and civilized ambiance. i particularly enjoyed the fact that the acoustics were manageable, since most of the new places in pittsburgh seem to be extremely loud.\u000a\u000athe staff are very friendly (still have a few kinks to work out in terms of timing, but that's ok), and the drinks are all phenomenal. i haven't had the food yet, but spoke with some other patrons who did have a meal, and they said that the food was very good. all of the food is based on regional specialties from around the states. and, all of the food is made from scratch in house. if the food is as carefully attended to as the drinks, then i think we have a real winner!\u000a\u000acan't wait to come back, and am so excited to see this new addition to the pittsburgh food scene!

Vhow do you explain this place to an ordinary person on the street?  simple, it's geeky.  in a good way.\u000a\u000aimagine those days where you were forced to take shop class in school.  now amplify them by about 100%.  it's more like wood shop, metal shop and art class all rolled into one.  you get to be as creative as you want here.  i know what you are thinking, but don't worry about the fact that you may not know how to use a piece of equipment in here.  it a learn as you go experience in here.  the teachers they have are more than happy to show you how to do something.\u000a\u000amonthly fees apply, or you could just choose to attend a specific class for a fee.  from glass etching to silk screening, this place will tickle your geek bone inside.\u000a\u000a*added bonus here if you are a veteran, no charge to you to join.

Va really friendly and knowledgeable staff.  a good inventory of fascinating books (i think everyone could find at least one book they want to leave the store with).  there could be a few more helpful signs for help in locating the various sections of the store, but it is also fun to just browse.  it's nice to have an independent bookstore downtown with a welcoming store and good inventory.  very cool that they are open on sundays.

Vsolid burger!\u000a\u000ai like to first judge a burger place on their standard, regular burger first before moving on to their more elaborate and creative ones. so i figured that i would do the same for this food truck, eh burger truck. i had seen them around at events where other food trucks were but, never tried them until now.\u000a\u000ai had the straight up burger (american cheese, onion, ketchup, mustard, pickle on a brioche bun.) the bun was soft and buttery and the meat was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. grab some extra napkins as the burger can get a bit messy. the fresh cut fries were very good as well.\u000a\u000ai can't decide which was better out of the two burger trucks i have tried so far (brgr and the steer and wheel) so i will call it a tie for now.

Vthis is a fun place to eat, although it does not have as many authentic brazilian dishes as green forest.  the price seems reasonable, given the amount of food.  they made a big deal out of telling us to turn over the medallion to the red side if you did not want additional meat brought to your table, however they kept bringing the meat anyway.  it's just a had place to have serious or quiet conversation, there are a lot of interruptions.  i loved the marvelous cheeses on the salad bar.  the meat was cooked perfectly.

Vi'm all for aldi's no matter where the location may be, but i'm super excited that they finally are breaking into the city limits with this store as well as the one on the southside.  this isn't really a typical aldi when you come to merchandise and set up.\u000a\u000athe merchandise is actually a little bit better.  there appears to be more national brands here than at most other locations.  i'm thinking it has something to do with nearby competition.  which is great, why buy the store brand when you can get the national brand for cheap?  also the layout of the store is a bit more flowing than most.  doesn't matter which way you enter the store; whether it be at the main entrance by the sidewalks or if you take the elevator from the parking garage.  the store just flows and makes it easy to pick up the items you want.\u000a\u000areminders: $.25 to use a cart, so take a quarter with you.  take a reusable bag, if not you will need to buy a bag at the store or take a box off the shelf.  and last but not least, you have to bag your own groceries.\u000a\u000athe whole reason i cannot give this place five stars is because of parking.  i'm starting to believe that in order for you to have any type of establishment in shadyside you have to have a horribly set up parking system.  yes, it is great that there is parking indoors, but you have to wait for the gate to rise if a car is exiting.  and it's a narrow one lane up to the parking decks.  what's worse, they may think you do not know how to read signs as they have parking attendants to tell you to wait, redundant is what it is.

Valmost everything here is an off brand, but the prices are really reasonable.  your choices are extremely limited, but you can get many of the basics here.  the store is rather clean and neat and arranged well.  looks like i can save some money here, so i will be back again.

Vthese cupcake creations are possibly a gift from above.  and i'm not talking about the room they have upstairs.\u000a\u000aif i hadn't just eaten before i had come in here, i'm quite sure i would have opted for every flavor they had that day, and then moved onto the whoopie pies (come on pittsburgh people, can't you just call them 'gobs?').\u000a\u000ai tried the chocolate, chocolate creme one and i was definitely not disappointed.  the cake itself is quite moist.  i had parts of it sticking to my fingers, which i always equate that to the cheese off a dorito...finger sucking flavor at the end.\u000a\u000anow, i have to say, i eat a cupcake in a very specific order.  i sit down, spread out a napkin, and then place the cupcake in the center of it.  carefully pull the wrapper away slowly, so i don't tear away anymore of that important cake off than needed.  pick up the cupcake under the brim with a c formation of my thumb and fingers and rip off the bottom of the cupcake.  yes folks, i am that person that eats the cakey bottom first.  why?  because i'm greedy like that.  i do want my cake, and i do want to eat it too.  except, i want to eat the iced part last.  after i devoured the bottom portion of my cake, i slowly take a bite of the top part.  savor the flavor of that chocolate on chocolate bliss.  then two seconds later i realized that i shoved the rest of it in my mouth, icing, decorations and all.  then of course i move onto to salvage the leftovers on my fingers.  after that sight, i return to normal mode and wipe my mouth with my napkin and proceed to walk away.  not shamed, but with dignity and pride that i just enjoyed one of the best cupcakes in all of pittsburgh.

Vlots of things to do and to see.  there's bike riding, kayaking, geo-caching, fishing, yoga and lots of exhibits.  i had fun watching the uno capoeira pittsburgh dancers and talking to some of the vendors.  the event was well organized and lots of fun.  if you are looking forward to kayaking, you may need to stand in line and wait, as that's a popular thing to try and there are only so many boats.

Vi love the beer market and i'm glad it came to the north side!  i think their prices are fair--not cheap, but they're not serving bud light and most craft beers are in the $5-7 range anywhere.\u000a\u000alike the other reviewer said, no food here--they make a big deal of letting you order from nearby restaurants, but most bars near restaurants let you do that.  i wouldn't come here for dinner...\u000a\u000athat being said, it's a great location and the perfect spot for meeting up with friends for some game day brews.

Vhow about we don't do a history lesson here. instead let us think about pittsburgh's fourth river. the one underground that no one talks about. the one that is rarely seen except for when the fountain is on. let's welcome back something beautiful for the city.\u000a\u000athere has to be a force at work here as well. it draws people from every different background and neighborhood. for some odd reason, when you are down here you become the most friendly person in the world. conversations start up by just standing there in awe staring at this beautiful thing. people begin a relationship here, kisses and sometimes proposals pop up. maybe it's the sense that you're at the convergence of all that massive power that is water?  who knows what it is that draws people here. it's calming, it's relaxing, it's therapeutic if you will.\u000a\u000amany people say that the fountain along with the park are part of our welcoming mat here. this can be true coming up the river, it's a fantastic first sight of the city. for a city that has an amazing entrance no matter what direction you come from, this just might be the best one out there.\u000a\u000ai'm gonna wrap this up now, but please don't forget about that fourth river (yes, i know it's an aquifer).

Vthis event was broken into two parts. the first was a walking tour of bloomfield courtesy of burgh bits & bites and the second was a beer tasting at church brew works courtesy of jake of pa brew tours.\u000a\u000arichard and sylvia from burgh, bits and bites tours were absolutely great! i never knew bloomfield was so interesting and had so much history and i've lived in the pittsburgh area my whole life. lol! the walking tour consisted of the following stops, angelo's pizzeria, groceria italia, merante's gifts and donateli's. while on the tour we learned about the different architecture of the area including dental crown molding and the beautiful st. joseph's church.\u000a\u000athe first stop, angelo's pizzeria served us some delicious cheese pizza. (i will be back soon!) \u000a\u000athe second stop, groceria italia a cute little italian grocery store that has been in the neighborhood for decades was my favorite stop. the fact that they make all of their pasta, sausages and meats by hand is a plus during a time when most things are made by machines. while there we got to meet "momma" and sample some homemade meatballs and pasta, outstanding!\u000a \u000athe third stop, merante's gifts is a cozy little store that sells italian among other home decor items. it's the perfect store to find trinkets for your nana. maria, the owner who also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs served us some tasty iced coffee in the kitchen where she does her classes. we also each got a amazing dessert while back in the gift shop.\u000a\u000athe fourth and final stop of the walking tour was donateli's, a italian grocery store similar to groceria italia. the main difference between the two is that donateli's pasta is not homemade and is supplied from another company. while there we got to try a orange and chocolate biscotti and see the "back of house" machines.\u000a\u000athe brewery portion was nice also. we got to sample three different beers. i don't drink beer so i can't really say they were all that good. jake really knows the history of beer in pittsburgh. the only bad thing that happened was the shuttle bus that dropped us off at church brew works left us stranded and we had to wait for him to come back. not jake's fault.\u000a\u000athanks rachel for another great event.

Vthai hana is a small restaurant in oakland.  i have been here a few times for lunch--i can't comment on the sushi or large plates, as i have always ordered a lunch special.  it's a pretty good deal at $7.95 for a healthy portion of stir fry or curry and your choice of white or brown rice.  bonus points because they don't price gouge you for choosing whole grain!\u000a\u000atheir vegetables are always fresh--you can tell they don't use the frozen stuff.  my go-to order is green curry tofu, and i vary the spice between 8 and 10.  they are waaaaay less hot here than at other thai places in the city i've been too, so don't be afraid to go a little higher than you normally would...though i'm the last person you want to ask about that! ;)

Vi really want to give this place a better review, because it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous and i wanted to love it...but i didn't.\u000a\u000athey just opened, so i'm hoping they are just working out some kinks.  the chips and salsa were great, but the food was just so-so.  i ordered a tamale, and the husband ordered some mole enchiladas--neither one of us thought the food was bad, it just wasn't our favorite.  the portions are also pretty small for the price, if that's something that bothers you.  (i didn't leave feeling hungry, i'm just saying.)  there are some really unique/authentic dishes on the menu compared to the usual mexican places around town.\u000a\u000ai ordered a glass of wine and he ordered a beer--another table had margaritas that looked awesome, so i think if we come back it will be a drinks/appetizers situation.  it's downstairs, kind of dark, romantically lit, and has an old-school mexican vibe that makes you feel like you're going to run into zorro or something.  definitely would be a good date-night spot if you're adventurous!

Vwell, i asked a random employee in the restaurant "donde esta el bao," and was answered in spanish, so that's a good sign. we tried the four salsa sampler, and all four were "muy delicioso" and the chips were nicely done as well. i ordered a house margarita which was pretty tasty and came out with a huge extra portion for me to refresh my glass from. muy bueno. the chicken enchiladas were good, although the meat was a little on the tough side. still, the sauces were great, and my dinner companions enjoyed their meals as well. service was friendly and our waitress even anticipated when we'd need more chips and brought them without asking. my only complaint is that the kitchen smoke from cooking occasionally filled the dining area with smoke, so they should really ventilate that a bit more. overall, a very positive experience - i'll be back.

Vwho knew there was a mexican grocery store in beechview?  there are so many unusual things for sale here that you can't get anywhere else, plus they have some wonderful taccos for sale.  their produce looks great, and it's a a lot of items that are hard to find in other stores.  definitely worth the trip!

Vcharming coffee shop with great food and coffee, this place is wonderful.  the building used to be a post office, so you can still see some of the old postal boxes.  there are lots of windows to let the sunshine in.  there are 2 floors with lots of different choices for sitting and talking.  the staff is very friendly.  \u000a\u000ai did find the music a little too loud, which is not conducive to conversations, but this was the only negative.

Vi was very excited to check out the fresh market's new store.  so excited that i braved the parking "situation"--others have described it adequately, but two weeks after opening they still have policemen to wave you and and make sure it's safe for people to back out of their spots (if they were lucky enough to get one).  inside is kind of a similar situation, but with shopping carts.\u000a\u000ai definitely wouldn't come here on a weekly basis for groceries, mostly due to the fact that i'm from the north side.  i bought a half gallon of ice cream that was totally melted by the time i made it out of this place and home.\u000a\u000ait is definitely something different--they have a good mix of "fancy" and more reasonable food items.  it would be a great place to come put together a picnic basket--baguette, cheeses, spreads, etc.  they also have delicious coffee.  \u000a\u000ai'm glad i checked it out and i may be back in the fall after the novelty wears off--it's just nice to see our grocery options expanding!!

Vi really like this place,  just wish it was closer!\u000a\u000awhile very similar to a giant eagle market district or whole foods, the fresh market is something fresh and unique. yes it's expensive but, so is giant eagle market district and whole foods. while it competes with both market district and whole foods you won't find everything you're looking for all the time as it is somewhat smaller then it's two main competitors. \u000a\u000aothers have complained about parking which i don't get. if you want to talk about crappy parking then look no further than the trader joe's,  whole foods or giant eagle market district parking lots in east liberty. now those are parking nightmares!\u000a\u000a the meat department has just about anything you could ever want or need. there is also a great selection of organic products. there's even a prepared food section with different flavors of wings, salads, sandwiches just to name a few. the other star of the show is the bakery. lots of different breads, cakes, pies, cookies and so much more.\u000a\u000asome of the prices were cheaper here than at whole foods or the market district and some weren't. i would say get your everyday items at aldi, bottom dollar or shop n' save and get your specialty items here if you can't find them cheaper at giant eagle market district or whole foods. defiantly worth stopping if you're ever in the area.\u000a\u000aall the employees i came in contact with were extremely pleasant and helpful. i just need a closer location and i would be a happy camper.

Vthe good thing about writing a review is that it may take a few days before you complete it.  wings over pittsburgh has totally benefited from this.  if i would have wrote a review after my first experience with this establishment it would be less stars and bitter words.\u000a\u000ai completely love the wrap they have available here.  it is a meal unto itself.  nothing really special about it, plain flour tortilla, lettuce, tomato and pieces of boneless wings with your choice of sauce or dry rub.  i have tried several different sauces and one dry rub.  for the wrap it is best to choose a sauce, if you get a dry rub, you will need something to dip it in, or hope that the juices from the tomatoes and lettuce will make it tasty.  you can add crinkle cut fries for $1 or seasoned waffle fries for $1.50.  as i said before, the wrap itself is more than enough for a meal.  when i get the fries with it i always feel like i'm stupid for doing so.  i can never finish both and i hate to waste it.\u000a\u000amy friends always order the ribs from here and are never disappointed.  if i was a rib man i would be too.  they look mighty good.  \u000a\u000a(minus two stars for my first encounter with you, but plus one star because you totally redeemed yourself and credited me on my next order)

Vlove that chicken from popeyes!\u000a\u000aseriously, getting off the bus and just having the smell of delicious fried chicken wafting around oakland is heaven, and the food lives up to the smell! the inside is clean and quite large, and the service there has always been fast and friendly for me. you can order online too, which is great if you have an especially large order, or you want an even faster fast food. they've got all the national specials that run for popeyes. oh, they have this crazy futuristic soda machine with, like, a million different drinks to choose from. pretty neat. \u000a\u000anow if popeyes would just bring back fried chicken livers....

Von a beautiful summer evening, i was excited to try sitting in the porch. it's pushed up against penn ave., and hence is wonderful every five minutes or so when the stop lights line up just right to quell traffic. otherwise, not so much. there was a strange intermittent smell of sewage as well. bummer. the inside wasn't appealing as it was ice cold.\u000a\u000aon the plus side, the shrimp salad i ordered was made with fresh crisp ingredients and was quite tasty. i also sampled the thai pizza which comes on an incredibly crispy crust. it was vaguely reminiscent of something you'd get at california pizza kitchen. there's also a decent beer list. \u000a\u000aoverall, i wasn't terribly impressed, but that wasn't really their fault. the sewage smells while eating don't exactly help a meal. i'll give them another chance in the future and probably sit inside (and bring a jacket).

Vwow, people were right about the smell outside.  i really hope that if you do come here, you take a seat inside.  i hope that they figure a way to overcome the storm drain right next to the patio area, it's unsettling.\u000a\u000aasides from the smell, the atmosphere is, um, how do i put this, uppity.  i felt like i was looked down upon by the other patrons.  really, you're in east liberty, a block away from larimer and homewood.  so what, you're in the same building as google, that doesn't make you any better than me.\u000a\u000anow, to the food.  the most amazing part of this place.  my favorite was the kale and artichoke dip.  the chunks of artichoke were so big, so tasty, that it made me forget the other things.  \u000a\u000athe service here too was well above average.  very nice, and very happy.  knowledgeable about the menu and able to answer all my questions.  \u000a\u000aa return visit here would definite have to be one where i sit inside and go at a different time in the day.

Vunderwhelming, if you're coming for the food. if you're just here for drinks, i'm sure this is a much better place.\u000a\u000ai came for lunch, and ordered the soup du jour and a side salad. kind of hard to mess up, right? the salad was supposed to be a caesar salad, but had the barest essence of dressing, pretty much non existent cheese, and the lettuce was wilted. as in, floppy limp whythehellwouldyouservethis wilted. whatever, it was a side salad, and i get it. who cares about side salads. it's not like you're charging $4 for stuff you probably wouldn't feed your own kid. oh, but there were a few giant croutons. guess that's what made it a caesar salad. maybe i was just disappointed because for a place that has a "build your own salad" option, i wouldn't have thought that a side salad would have been so disappointing.\u000a\u000athe soup was "baked potato" soup, which was really just creamy potato with some bacon and sour cream. i'm not sure what i was expecting, come to think of it, so i'm not going to give them a hard time about this one, but it wasn't anything i would come back for.\u000a\u000amy friend had the veggie burger, which came with a whole bunch of tater tots. now, i haven't had tater tots since elementary school, so i actually give them props for appealing to my retro side. she said the burger was very good. \u000a\u000athe service was fine, and it's got a nice informal atmosphere that i am sure makes it the perfect place for happy hour. but as a person who doesn't much drink... this place is not impressive at all.

Vthe pizzas are excellent and the beer selection is very good.  i mostly come here for drinks, so i have not tried anything other than the pizza, but they make really good pizza. \u000a\u000ai did see that they have a $40 bottle of wine that the restaurant pays less than $10, so i can't recommend the wine at social.

Vi started going to california cycle path with the intention of working out for only a month to cram in as much exercise as i could before i was a bridesmaid. well, that was about 4 months ago, and i'm still an active member! ccp is a great place for a structured workout in a welcoming atmosphere. let's talk about the workouts, then the atmosphere. \u000a\u000accp is not a gym, so you won't be able to come here to stroll on a treadmill or juice your lats and blast your delts like at a gym. the core offerings at ccp are spinning/cycling classes, trx suspension classes, and zumba. other classes such as deskercise, personal conitioning, yolates, and bone building (for those at risk for osteoporosis) are also offered regularly, but not as frequently as the core classes. i've taken cycling, trx, and zumba; and they're all great. cycling is great for an intense calorie burn and cardiovascular conditioning. the music is bumping, and there's a screen behind the instructor showing various cycling paths, or the red bull challenges, or psychedelic shapes that move to the music. there's a wide variety of music played, though i think it would be fun to have themed classes. for example, specific artist (eg., beyonce, britney, or michael jackson) or genre (hip hop, classic rock, edm) class. the trx is awesome for building muscle, improving coordination and athleticism. i think it was invented by some marine guys, so, you know.... zumba is the fun dancing exercise that's good for burning calories and cardiovascular health, coordination, and a bit of muscle building. i leave each of these classes sweating and happy.  \u000a\u000aif you're like me, attending a gym/exercise class for the first few times can be nerve racking. i'm not in crazy good shape, i'm all alone, fitness people can be judgmental sometimes, etc... everyone here is so freaking friendly, though, that after about 10 minutes, i was at ease. here's the thing, i want to describe ccp as a family, because it feels that way. however, i always get a little antsy when i see a business described as a family. you don't always keep the highest standard for your family (that fancy hand soap is for guests!), and it suggests that there's already a formed group to which you do not belong.  these worries have not materialized at ccp, though. the owners (john and larry), the other instructors and the other members get to know you quickly, and you feel welcomed and comfortable. there's truly a variety of ages, shapes, races, fitness levels, and genders within the members. cycling classes always end with cold, lavender-scented towels being handed out; the fridge is always filled with water and juice; there's always complimentary snacks and coffee available; the space is always clean; and i can always join or cancel a class through their website or app.\u000a\u000acalifornia cycling path is a great addition to the north shore/brighton heights area, and if you're looking for a different type of workout, give it a try!

Vi'm happy that i didn't review this place a few months ago...they were having growing pains, badly.  the store was a mess, but in the few months that have passed, they really have advanced into a little bit better place.\u000a\u000athis is on the same line of stores such as tj maxx, marshalls and ross dress for less.  the selection is the same mix of items they usually have like other places.  however, when i recently walked in and asked if they had and steelers stuff they told me no.  \u000a\u000areally?  you are in pittsburgh, why don't you have pittsburgh themed stuff.  they didn't have anything.  no pirates, penguins or pitt panthers.\u000a\u000athe clothing here is like the leftovers that the other discount chains didn't want.  you can find a buy in here, but you are going to have to scour the racks and shelves in order to find it.  there always seems to be a sale going on here too.  every week it's a different type of clearance event.

Vi was in the mood to try someplace different on my lunch hour, even if it meant trekking a few blocks out of my way.  and after having tried boulevard deli, i can safely say it was well worth the hike.  \u000a\u000anearly all of the items on the menu here have pittsburgh-centric names and it was hard for me to decide.  the pittsburgher?  hmm, i'm not exactly fond of chipped ham, so no.the south side?  well a good cappicola is always tempting.  the squirrel hill?  hey, that's my neighborhood, so why not!  the squirrel hill is corned beef, 1000 island dressing, and 'kraut.\u000a\u000ain other words, a ruben!\u000a\u000aoh, but my sandwich was excellent and i was so glad i was able to walk a little bit of it off on the way back!

Vi went to the grand opening of the livermore and i am really excited about the food, drinks and ambiance.  the owners have kept most of the historical details intact and have lovingly restored the space.  the name livermore comes from the legendary stock market trader and author of how to trade stocks, jessie livermore.  livermore was famed for making and losing multi-million dollar fortunes and short selling during the stock market crashes in 1907 and 1929.  i think the restaurant captures a sense of the early 20th century, evoked by the high ceilings, stained glass and tile work.  the food here is all made from scratch, including the artisan bread.  one highlight is the delicious crostini that come in 5 different varieties.  the drinks are made using old school techniques, they don't use any shortcuts, and they are all high quality.   some cool things about the restaurant include an authentic antique cash register.  the bar is made from the wood salvaged from a bowling alley, so as you can imagine, it looks rather old and impressive.  another feature is the huge shop window that looks out into the street.  this is definitely a cool place to hang out, i know that i will be back.

Vi really enjoyed my cocktail and the atmosphere, however, i went on a weekday so it was not particularly busy. i could definitely  see it getting packed and loud on weekends as the space is very limited and they try to accommodate as many as possible.\u000a\u000athe drink menu only listed the names of the drink, any other establishment would have the actual ingredients listed, or at least the main libation following the name. i am not a mixologist, i do not know a corpse river from a dark and stormy. i can not drink certain liquors so of course i had to ask our waitress what was in this and what was in that. she did not hide her annoyance with my questions. sorry sweetheart, but  if the main libations were listed, i wouldn't have so many damn questions.\u000a\u000ai chose not to order any of the small bites but my companion ordered the oyster escabeche, which was very garlicky and messy. the oysters themselves were ice cold and rubbery. \u000a\u000ai do not see myself returning, if i want a cocktail, there are other places in the city i can think of.

Vi was impressed by the food and the craft beer selection.  the staff is very attentive and they let you try different beers until you find something you like.  the pizzas are extraordinary, and everybody who works here is helpful and hard working.  the location is in the heart of the cultural district, so this place is a perfect watering hole for before or after a play or performance.

Vif you're on penn avenue & looking for a not-run-of-the-mill italian place, then check out proper brick oven.  some colleagues and i did just that on a beautiful day that made the walk over here totally worth it.\u000a\u000anow the pizzas here can be pricey in contrast to what you'd pay at, say, monte cellos.  but the sandwiches are comparably priced to any decent restaurant around here.  actually, what they have here are puccias--homemade stuffed pugliese sandwich rolls.  i ordered the antipasti puccia, consisting of spicy pepperoni with capicolla and roasted red pepper topped off with smoked mozzarella.  definitely not something you'd find at subway!\u000a\u000aproper brick oven isn't a place i'd eat at everyday, but it does make for a great occasional treat.  i'm going to someday check out their brunch.

Vcheap food fast is the best way to describe this place.  i understand the the concept of a buffet and you basically serve yourself.  but to be bombarded before you even sit down with questions from the servers is a bit irritating.  like they already know what you are going to order, so there is really no need for a ton of questions.\u000a\u000athe food is mediocre at best.  it's not gourmet for sure, but it will do.  buffet size wise, it's a bit on the small side.  so you get the basic chinese fare, but nothing extravagant.  you will get full here, but you may not feel all that great afterwards.

Vchina buffet and china garden are one in the same, cg is a portion of the restaurant for take out and delivery while cb is obviously a sit down and serve yourself buffet. i really don't have any complaints, as a vegetarian this place satiates my hunger pangs. veggie lo mein, egg foo young, peppery fried potatoes, veggie egg rolls, mac and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, string beans and mixed veggies are always hot and tasty.

Vi've sampled their wares several times in the last week or two due to the generosity of coworkers bringing croissants in to work, but today was my first experience in the actual shop. it's beautiful inside -- shiny and clean, and the staff seem friendly. there's even a full wall window where you can watch the food being made.\u000a\u000athe croissants seem roughly on par with those from french bakeries in town, and the macaroon i had was delicious albeit a little strange since it was basil and white chocolate flavored.their almond croissant is tougher and less sweet than the like from, la gourmandine, but still good.\u000a\u000aoverall, i'm not sure it's quite as good as la gourmandine or jean-marc chatellier's, but it's definitely in a more convenient location for me, and to be fair, it's trying to fill a slightly different niche than the other ones. it's also brand-new, so they may have some kinks to iron out. it's a great addition to squirrel hill -- check it out today!

Vthis is a decent enough spot to do "some" shopping.  i put some in quotations for a reason.  this is definitely not your spot for one stop shopping.  but it does have a decent spread of stores to choose from.\u000a\u000alike the name says, this is a town square.  complete with a post office and tax service center.  other stores that dot the area range from sports ware to grocery.  there are also some chain stores that pop up in every shopping destination that you stop at.\u000a\u000ai really love the layout they have here as it makes you feel like you are in a close knit community.  i'm sure if i would have stopped here during a warmer month i would have probably just sat there and people watch.  it's actually beautiful, all red brick, a nice walkway in the center.  maybe i will stop back here when it is warmer, there will be more people around by then and i won't be blown across the parking lot by the gusts of bone chilling air.

Vsienna mercato is a great addition to the downtown restaurant scene.  although the menu is somewhat limited, the food is reasonably priced and the service is quick and friendly.  i chose the spicy pork meataballs and the escarole & beans, and both were delicious.  the location is perfect for before or after a show downtown, which is a real plus.  the front opens up when the weather is nice, which is a wonderful feature.  the food is not at the same level as their sister restaurant, sienna sulla piazza, but the prices are more reasonably priced and there's a lot less waiting time.  they don't take reservations, however they have lots of tables, so i can't imagine a long wait.

Vmany of you may be wondering about the new mezzo floor of sienna mercato.  the good news is that the service is excellent and the food is delicious.  \u000a\u000athey bring a lot of experience from their other restaurant.  for example, there's a wine i love on the sienna sulla menu that also is carried by mezzo.\u000a\u000ai had a wonderful charcuterie and cheese board that was great for splitting for 2 or 3 people.  the pizza is cooked in an authentic wood fired oven, and the choices are creative.  \u000a\u000afor dessert we split the gianduja tartufo, which was a tasty way to finish our meal.  \u000a\u000aone reason the staff was so well trained is they came from one of the other sienna restaurants.  all in all, highly recommended.

Vmezzo is a great spot if you know what you want and you come here for pizza and wine--if you want a draft beer, you have to get it from either the first or third floor of sienna on a separate tab--so go in knowing that.  my husband was a little annoyed with this, and we ended up drinking water with our pizza and heading upstairs for after-dinner beers...a little awkward, but still fun.\u000a\u000athe food itself is really great!  i have had better wood-fired pizza, but not in pittsburgh.  you can tell the ingredients are fresh and the chef was creative with his combinations.  i would recommend this place for date night, but we still prefer emporio, the meatball joint downstairs!

Vi stopped in for lunch while on a break, it wasn't busy and i was seated right away. looking at the menu, i had high hopes for the establishment. i decided on a grilled cheese and blg fries (blue cheese and garlic butter), i figured they would be similar to the gorgonzola truffle fries that burgatory offers... not even close. my plate was a pool of grease which coated my tongue and i couldn't taste anything. everything on my plate was one note...oily.\u000a\u000ai ate it because i was starving and had to get back to a seminar but i won't be returning. the blue line grille appears that it would be a great place for hockey fans to grab a brew and catch a pens game just don't order the food until you discuss it with your cardiologist first.

Vreally great addition to the cultural district.  the food is very good, the service is excellent, and they offer extended hours that the kitchen is open.  i tried their french onion soup, which was brand new on the menu.  it was not a traditional style french onion soup, the broth was much meatier, less thin.  it was a creative take on a classic dish, and the chef definitely made it work.   great atmosphere. even though the restaurant was packed, the seating is on different levels, so it feels less crowded to me.

Vi drove by a few days ago, and noticed that the signage where aji picante used to be had changed... intriguing! so, when we didn't have any food at home and needed a place to go, i suggested that we see if nu had opened.\u000a\u000anu bills itself as a modern jewish bistro (the name is yiddish). inside, it looks only a little like aji picante used to, mainly because they have added an open kitchen in the middle. i prefer this incarnation, and think nu has a lot of potential. the food is distinctively jewish, with an emphasis on sandwiches, soups, and deli salads (think smoked fish or eggs). the aesthetic is similar to porch and its ilk, down to the chalkboard announcements of the day's offerings. so, consider it an upscale jewish deli, but with much nicer service! you seat yourself when you walk in, and the menus are kept on the table, just like they are at pamela's. service was very sweet.\u000a\u000awe had 1) jewish penicillin (i.e. chicken soup), 2) chili, 3) the special brisket sandwich, and 4) mama's meat blintzes. the chicken soup was quite good, and definitely worth having if you are in need of some comfort food when you come down with the inevitable cold/flu. i had it with a matzo ball, which was a bit on the dense side. the chili was overly salty, and almost completely beef, with minimal beans. some people may prefer that version of chili; i do not. i prefer a balance of beans to meat to tomato, and this was just too meaty for me, even though i am quite carnivorous! the brisket was also a little on the dry side. the blintzes were pretty tasty, but could have used a bit more filling (or maybe we are just spoiled by grandma's blintzes... unclear).\u000a\u000ai know this review makes this place sound not so good. let me be clear - i think nu has a lot of potential, and we fully intend on coming back again once they have gotten a little more time under their belt. despite feeling a bit "meh" on the food this first time, we liked it enough that we really want to see it succeed.\u000a\u000aif you're vegetarian, you can pretty much write this place off. there is a salad or two that might work for you, but otherwise, this is not your place.

Vcomfort food prepared with authentic recipes.  our waitress was familiar from when she worked at aji picante.  everyone was helpful and friendly.  their most popular dish is the upstreet dip, a brisket sandwich with caramelized onions.  we ordered that and it  was very good. we also ordered the nu nu platter and the matzo ball soup.  everything was very filling.

Vten penny is a very nice addition to the mid range/high end food scene in pittsburgh. it's located right across from the greyhound terminal, so not in the choicest part of downtown, but it does make it relatively easier to find parking! just as an fyi - they do have valet, it's $10 (steep!) that you pay on the spot, and then if you eat at the restaurant, they refund you $3 off your bill. kind of weird, if you ask me.\u000a\u000ainterior decor is very much in line with cure and pig and chicken, with the warmed up industrial wood/reclaimed iron/brick aesthetic. what i liked about it was that it was spacious, and thus, probably can accommodate larger parties (unlike cure) and also the noise level was manageable. so, a very comfortable, informal place to have good food and good drink. service is friendly!\u000a\u000athey have a very extensive wine menu, and very knowledgeable staff to help you make your choice. we actually tried three different wines before settling on one. it was very nice of them to be so willing to try and make sure we got something we really liked. \u000a\u000afood was good, but not exceptional. we started with the mushroom flatbread (fine) and crabcakes (good!). three of us had the filet, which was a seriously large hunk of meat. very tender, but i felt as though mine was a bit underseasoned, even though it came with a nice demi-glaze sauce. the filets came with sides of brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes, both of which could have used more salt. the other person in our party had the duck, which was also good, but not out of this world.\u000a\u000awe tried two desserts: the dessert special, which was a hazelnut tart, and the bombe off the usual dessert menu. the bombe was truly the bombe - definitely recommend it.\u000a\u000aall in all, a success. would definitely come back again!

Vyes, very americanized chinese food, but reasonably priced and with great service. they seem to do mostly takeout service, however the dining room is clean, spacious and inviting. big portion sizes and delicious. this place is a great option in favor of fast food.

Vi love the name of this place, i love the fact that they are trying to mash it up.  with a name that kind of evokes an italian mexican chain, it's not what you are really getting.  one of the other things that i really appreciate of this place is that they deliver to a huge amount of neighborhoods circling around the downtown area.\u000a\u000asince i started out on writing my review for this place i have ordered at least twice from here.  both times i was not disappointed.  both times i was full.\u000a\u000amy first order was one of their bread twists.  i had the pepperoni variety.  if you need a visual for this, just think of everything that you would put on a pizza, minus the sauce, stuffed inside some bread that is in the shape of a c.  only minus the sauce on the inside, why, because you get a side of marinara on the side with some ranch (more on that later) on the side.  it was good, so good that i ate it all in one sitting.  \u000a\u000amy next order here was a salad.  with a mix of iceberg and spring mix lettuce i wasn't let down by this.  add in some cucumbers, red onions, and tomatoes i was sold.  i had opted for some of that ranch dressing i mentioned prior.  what is so good about it?  it's homemade.  so good, definitely not store bought.  i thank you for this due to my allergies, i could actually enjoy a ranch dressing again.\u000a\u000ayou've definitely earned another repeat customer in me.\u000a\u000a\u000awoot woot!  review #700

Vanother great yelp event!\u000a\u000awhat made the event so special was the fact that there were so many tables with information on volunteering opportunities and ways to give back to the community. i never knew pittsburgh had so many of this types of organizations. \u000a\u000ai had never been to the pittsburgh public theatre before this event. the venue was very nice and is much bigger than it appears. not to mention three floors with tons of tables filled with tasty goodness to sample. my favorite food table was defiantly luke wholey's fish tacos. they were amazing! i have never been to his place but, believe me i'm on the way!\u000a\u000amy favorite vendor table was assemble. they had these cool little led light pins that grabbed my attention so i had to walk over to their table and find out more about them. julia was very nice and explained about their program. they are a non profit in garfield that offers a tons of different programs including free weekly after school help with homework on tuesdays and a weekly 2 hour technology/ craft program for kids and teens on saturdays that i signed my daughter up for. she absolutely loves the program. if it wasn't for this event i would have never found out about them.\u000a\u000athanks rachel for having such a cool and unique event!

Vwow, to walk into a place and it still smells like new, such an odd occurrence in this neighborhood.  i'm still baffled as why this store relocated only two blocks away?\u000a\u000abut for what it's worth, they really did improve on the store experience in this neck of oakland.  now 24 hours and with a drive thru pharmacy.  the parking lot has ample spaces even if it is a bit harsh to figure out the best way to access this place.  \u000a\u000ainside, like i said is brand new, it has that new carpet smell still going on.  it is bright and big.  from the outside they have this illusion going on as if it is a two story building, but it's really only one story with a very high ceiling.\u000a\u000apharmacy has separate hours from the store, expected.  but i believe there is someone staffed there in case you need to grab a otc medication that is stored in that area.  self checkouts in the front, for an easy in and out experience.

Vi was very excited to go to grit and grace, however i felt a little let down. the ambiance is wonderful, and this is certainly a great place to hold a conversation.  but the food often sacrificed taste for the sack of novelty and cuteness.  i ordered the brisket, which was a very playful take on a reuben sandwich. that's fine, if you knew that's what you were getting.  the desserts were the same way...smoked apple crisp with crumpled cheez-it topping.  fun and tasty, just not completely satisfying.  the concept of american dim sum is fascinating, but the dim sum menu was limited to 6 items, i was expecting more variety.  but if you think about it, how different is what they are doing from tapas/small plates.  this is a very playful and inventive restaurant, it's just that the food was not as good as i was hoping for.

Vwe walked by on a saturday afternoon and it was packed, so we were excited to come back on a sunday for lunch and see what the fuss was about.  it's a very modern and casual restaurant, with unusual art and music, and communal tables with stools for seating.  very trendy, though not a place you want to linger for hours as you'll be sat next to somebody else and you can't lean back at all!  cash only as well.\u000a\u000ai can't find a menu online, but i remember that it was full of really unusual offerings.  not just the usual curries you see anywhere, there were lots of ingredients i'd never heard of in fascinating combinations.  we both went for the kuay tiaw nam tak nua (under the soup bowl section) and added noodles for 1.  apparently noodles aren't traditional in this soup, but i'd recommend them!  this is a flavorful, herbal soup with beef broth and extremely tender meat (though not quite enough of it).  we also shared a few snacks - a side of stir-fried veggies (which were oddly delicious, they were cooked very gently in a very delicate sauce and were a vast improvement over the usual bland steamed affair) and an unusual side of calamari and prawns in a sweet-sour sauce with some crispy crackers in.  i didn't really "get" that one, it wasn't what i'd pictured.  felt like proper street food, lots of things all blended together in a box with strong flavors, but it was a bit of an odd combo!  our soup came in bowls, but all the other dishes came in little cardboard boxes that look like they're meant for takeaway, which is a cute little touch.  oh, and we got a lemongrass ginger juice - and hated it.  so sticky and sweet and strange.  fiance said it tasted like squash (not like, butternut...the concentrated juice syrup that you can get in the uk) and we left it almost untouched.\u000a\u000ait's a very cheap place to get a meal!  it's certainly an interesting dining experience, i love how different it is and how full of surprises the food was.  you can fill up easily for under 10, probably even less.  great place to pop in for a fun lunch, off the beaten path in edinburgh.

Vthey sell an assortment of freshly baked breads, cookies, and other desserts as well as making sandwiches to order. bags of various mixes including trail mix ("pittsburgh pothole crunch), brownie mix, and pancake mix are also available. they also sell some penn's corner csa items including their delicious (and expensive salsa). \u000a\u000ai can vouch for the oatmeal cookies which are delicious. the port authority (portobello veggie sandwich, and the baja turkey were both good. service is a bit slow, but they're new so i imagine it will improve with time.

Vhonestly, i went for the novelty, but i will go back because they have a great product at a reasonable price.\u000a\u000ait's good service, but not exactly fast food.  i'm thinking they don't start making your food until you order it, so be prepared for about a 15 minute wait.\u000a\u000athis is an idea that started in italy about 9 years ago, however they seem to have perfected the process here in pittsburgh.  the store itself is the old bresler's 33 flavors shop, so you can see some of the vestiges in the ice cream canisters and the booth seating.  \u000a\u000athe staff is friendly and they hustle to get your order ready.  i am already a fan, it's something that tastes great and only costs about 5 or 6 bucks.  i think their business will pick up even more as the weather improves, i picture people walking around squirrel hill eating their pizza cones.\u000a\u000aanyway, i thought this might be a fad, but because it tastes great, i imagine that more people will want their pizza in a cone.

Vfirst rate voices in a great production of porgy and bess.  unlike other yelpers, i am more of an opera fan, so i would have preferred to hear the singer's voices without amplification.  putting that aside, this was an amazing opportunity to hear gerswin's masterpiece.  there were memorable songs sung by a a very talented cast.  the plot was gripping, and the staging was excellent.

Vi wish this new location had opened while i was still living in shadyside! darn it! its so close to my old residence that i would've been eating there at least three days a week! oh well! at least it's close to work! \u000a\u000achipotle has an app you can use to order your food and i tried it out for the first time! it's pretty easy to use and almost everything  on chipotles menu is on there (i didn't see corn though). the app gives you the option to pay for your food with a credit/debit card or pay when you pick up. \u000a\u000ayou can also choose the time you plan to pick up your food. when i arrived i had no issues walking up to the cash register and requesting my pre-ordered meal. then again, there were not a lot of people in line to begin with but it was still crowded in the dining area. \u000a\u000achipotle is one of my favorite places but i've never liked going to the baum location due to the lack of parking and the traffic. i'm glad this new location is open and with the chipotle app it makes ordering more convenient! yay!

Vi wasn't prepared for the experience, so am going to go into a bit of detail about how this place works. i walked in needing an eyebrow wax, and figured i would try this place out, since it was newly opened. the receptionist asked me if i had ever been to a european wax center before, and i dutifully (and truthfully) answered no. she then went into a spiel about their rates on getting brazilians done (seriously lady, i just said i wanted my eyebrows done). their rates are by subscription or volume packaging. so, you could buy something like 6 treatments, and receive 1 free or subscribe for a monthly rate and know that you'd get a treatment every month. or you could pay a la carte (which i did... sort of. your first session is free - score!).so if you are a waxing junkie or just really like to go regularly, this is definitely a good place to consider. it's clean, young, and hip.\u000a\u000athe wax job itself was fine, but unexceptional. they use some sort of wax that doesn't require cloth strips and was not painful at all. allegra was very nice and explained each step to me as she was doing them ("now i'm using a cleanser, this calms the skin," etc. kind of seemed superfluous for someone who isn't new to waxing, but whatever). i don't think it was the most amazing eyebrow waxing job i've ever had, since other places i have gone have been more aggressive about shaping my brows. she was worried that my brows were too sparse for what i wanted, and recommended that i use some sort of brow regrowing solution.\u000a\u000afrankly, i was just amused by the entire experience. my brows got cleaned up, but i'll be going back to my usual place, since they are perfectly able to work with my brows as they are now (no growing solution needed!). and, they are comparably priced. when i walked out, all the products that had been used got put on the counter, and they assumed that i would be coming back in three weeks and tried to push me on making an appointment. i really don't fault them for this - their business model is to get you going regularly and frequently. but the upselling and aggressiveness by which this was done really turned me off to the experience and i won't be going back unless i have to. so word to the wise - if you are at all a pushover, avoid this place, because you will be strongly encouraged to buy things or sign up for things.

Vfor my first winghart's experience, this was a good choice.  asides from the parking snafu (hence the star deduction), it was a good experience.  having wanted to try winghart's for a very long time, and not having the time to stop in one of the other locations i was super excited to see they opened a location in oakland.  right down the street from where i work! (i'm being spoiled with all the good places to eat around my place of work)\u000a\u000ai called my order ahead before showing up.  good call there.  i showed up and still had a little bit of a wait, but not too long.  while waiting i took in the surroundings of the place.  they did a great job with the small interior they have.  i also like the patio/porch area they have.  although i'm sure that could be annoying later in the warmer months, by that i mean you will have to put up with the college kids on their patio/porch firing up their grills.  however, i'm sure their food would not be as good as what you get here.\u000a\u000aspeaking of food, let's discuss.  of course my coworkers and i ended up ordering a ton of different things with one thing in common, hand cut fries.  the fries were perfect, i really can't say more than that, perfect.  i ordered the dockworker, which my friends is nothing more than homage to a beloved pittsburgh classic that could surely have it's own following soon.  awesome fries, sweet cole slaw, and the burger patty itself was cooked exactly how i asked for it to be cooked.  for once, i have seen a burger patty that surpassing the bun!  my friend ordered the matolla and i believe we were in the same boat by being impressed by how big the sandwich was alone.\u000a\u000ai can't believe i'm about to say this, but it was a huge mistake to order a side of fries.  with as big as the burger was, a side really isn't needed.  and the price is justified for once.  i had heavenly happy burger dreams that night.\u000a\u000athe staff were great as well.  very attentive, courteous beyond belief and made me want to fight traffic, search for a parking spot and come back the next day.  you've won me over winghart, yes you have.

Vthis is a fun atmosphere to be in, but the bartenders really need to change their attitudes.  i didn't make you become a bartender and if you want that tip i am about to give you, don't be looking like grumpy cat at me.  also, don't take about five minutes to even notice that i have been standing in front of you with money in hand.  nothing irritates me more than having to wave you down in that brief second it took you to look up from your cell phone screen.  i am a patron, take care of me and i'll be nice with the tipping.\u000a\u000aanother thing that was a bit disturbing to me was the bathroom.  a single wide open room that had no dividers to separate the toilet from the urinal.  if you forget to lock the door and someone opens it, you are basically giving the whole bar area a show...for free.\u000a\u000athe decor in here looks really dim and therefore it looked really dark to me during the daylight hours.\u000a\u000a**i did not try the food, was just here for the bar experience.  maybe i'll try the food at a later date, but only maybe.

Vwhen i discovered that crunch gym was about to open in the waterfront, i immediately signed up for a membership and cancelled my membership at planet fitness. crunch is much closer to where i live which is a big deal since i don't like to spend a lot of time driving just to go to the gym.\u000a\u000ainitially i thought crunch would comprise of the bottom and top floors of the old filenes basement. however, crunch is on the top floor and a men's clothing store will be on the bottom floor. the gym is actually smaller than other gyms i've been to but it is still spacious and even has a large fitness studio for the various classes that are offered such as pilates and zumba.\u000a\u000athe women's locker room is nice. it has a grey and purple color scheme going on. there are plenty of lockers, a scale, five bathroom stalls, three showers and an area where there are sinks  as well as an extra counter to do your hair and make up. there are no paper towels, only two hand dryers.  the only thing i don't like about the locker room is that there are no changing stalls. \u000a\u000athere are plenty of options available to have a fun and effective workout. if you are a cardio queen or king, there are an estimated 30 treadmills, around a dozen or more elliptical machines, and a handful of stairstep machines. the weightlifting area is my favorite. there are plenty of free weights and weight machines (plate and pin) to tone or build up your muscles. if you prefer to stretch before you work out, there is an area in the front of the facility that provides mats. also in that same area are kettle bells and exercise balls. fitness classes are also offered at crunch. i haven't participated in one yet but retro-tonics sounds fun. to see what classes are being offered and at what time, you can visit crunch's website.\u000a\u000ai have the peak membership that permits me access to the hydro-massage bed and tanning booths. after my workout i absolutely have to go on the hydro-massage bed. o. m. g. this massage bed is awesome! it's like having a hundred hot tub jet streams massaging your body! you can program the hydro-massage bed to give you a full body massage or to just massage  specific areas. the massage lasts for ten minutes. if you decide to use it during peak hours you will have to wait a while as it's quite popular. there are two tanning booths if you prefer to tan instead of waiting for the hydro-massage bed. \u000a\u000acrunch gym is clean and new and the staff is pleasant. there is a diverse group of people who utilize crunch, which i really like! gym membership is also affordable at $10 for a base membership and $20 for peak. so far i love working out here!

Vwhat an amazing, one of a kind (thus far for pittsburgh), vibrant place.\u000a\u000astopped in here during our st. paddy's day excursion.  my expectations were low when we were traversing the stairs to the roof, but as soon as we got through the door to the roof, i was impressed.  talk about space, this place definitely has got the space.  even for it being packed for the festivities of the day, it was easy to maneuver in here.  \u000a\u000anormally, from what the website said, there is a pool in the middle of the area, but for the nighttime the floor is covered over and people are able to dance the night away.  there are cabanas that line both sides of the pool area and seating along the one side.  a bar then lines the last side of the pool area.  watch your step her as well, there are stairs that lead from the bar area to the deck area proper.  and talk about a vantage point to see the city's skyline from the south side.  totally worth paying a cover here.\u000a\u000apoints to note here:  check the website, hours may be listed here, but you need to see how the hours are divided up; prices are dependent on the hours that you choose to attend, i believe daytime hours are more due to being able to use the pool area; memberships are available and limited; parking...well, it's the south side; only open three days a week; finally, it is kind of connected to diesel.

Vcompared to other fro yo spots, this place just does not stand out. \u000a\u000athey only had two tart flavors (original and mango) the rest were sweet such as peanut butter, banana, cookie, and such.\u000a\u000aa majority of the fruit was straight from the can (peaches, pineapples) and the "fresh" fruit wasn't ripe (think green strawberries). they also have all the sweet, not so good for you toppings but i can't tell you how fresh those items were.\u000a\u000aif i'm in the area, i'll probably stop in again because it's the only fro yo place in edgewood. hopefully, the fruit will be fresh in the summer when it's more in season.

Vi love self serve frozen yogurt places. i actually came here once during the winter. there various kinds of frozen yogurt flavors. i only like chocolate and that's what i always get. there are different fruit and candy toppings. ive had a little bit of everything. the toppings were fresh and didn't taste stale. the spoons are reusable; i keep mine in my purse. why throw away a perfectly good spoon? it's been hot these days, so it would be a real treat to come in here for some frozen yogurt.

Vgreat wines, wonderful food, and cozy ambiance.  i have just been once to open bottle, but i can't wait to go back.  the staff is welcoming and the service is very good.you may remember the building from when it was la casa, but i think this restaurant works better in this new format and with a new owner.  i had the roasted amish chicken basquaise, which was prepared beautifully.  the wine list is one of the most intriguing in pittsburgh.

Vthis just opened location is right across the street from the movie theater. there have been so many different restaurants in this space i can't keep track of them all. \u000a\u000athe space is rather small compared to the previous restaurant that occupied the same space. i'm not sure why burgatory didn't take more space as the storefront next door is available for lease and was a part of the last restaurant that was there. they need all the square footage they can get. \u000a\u000ai still don't get why burgatory doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait 1 hour plus on the weekends now that the weather is nice. one really cool new feature they do have is that once you are put into the que of people waiting you can go to the no wait app and see how many people are ahead of you and when it is time to walk back over to the restaurant.\u000a\u000athe wife and i started off with our usual berry lemonades and our daughter had a natrona vanilla cream soda.\u000a\u000afor an appetizer we got the just fork it (fresh cut fries smothered with braised short ribs, cheddar cheese curds & pan gravy) they were epic and worth the wait themselves! \u000a\u000anext my daughter and i both got the standard deluxe burger. it's a burger with white american cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and their house burger sauce. i added bacon and sauteed mushrooms to mine. it was huge and outstanding! the wife got the hot chick sandwich. (grilled herbed chicken, sharp provolone, tomatoes, house-made guacamole, chipotle sour cream & cilantro leaves on grilled herbed focaccia. served with lightly dressed field greens.)\u000a\u000ai also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps . \u000a\u000aif you haven't been before here's how it works.\u000a\u000astep 1. pick your burger. \u000a\u000ayou have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger. \u000a\u000astep 2. pick your bun. \u000a\u000anext you pick your bun with brioche, wheat, baguette, focaccia, \u000atopless or full monty style as choices \u000a\u000astep 3. pick your rub. \u000a\u000achoose from angel dust, kona crust, bbq, kingston jerk, \u000acracked peppercorn and bayou cajun \u000a\u000astep 4. pick your cheese for $1 more \u000a\u000achoose from cheddar, white american, horseradish cheddar, \u000asharp provolone, gorgonzola, mozzarella, smoked gouda and buffalo cheddar. \u000a\u000astep 5. pick your sauce. \u000a\u000achoose from bourbon bbq, dijon mayo, banana ketchup, house sauce, spicy marinara, guacamole, sour cream, roasted garlic mayo, sriracha remoulade, buttermilk ranch, spicy ketchup, \u000awhole grain mustard, avocado wasabi, bleu cheese dressing, \u000abuffalo sauce, relish and chipotle sour cream \u000a\u000astep 6. pick a topping for $1 to $1.50 more. \u000a\u000achoose from fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken chili, caramelized onion marmalade, grilled pineapple, sauted mushrooms, maple cured ham, onion straws, roasted tomatoes, grilled onions, brandied peppercorn, cabernet sauce and roasted red peppers. \u000a\u000astep 7. pick a free topping. \u000a\u000achoose from iceberg, romaine, field greens, baby spinach, \u000aarugula, red onion, tomato, poblano peppers, cucumbers, banana peppers, bread & butter pickles and jalapenos. lots of choices and ways to customize your burger.\u000a\u000aour waitress jordan was great as well and took really good care of us. i think the waterfront finally has a winner that will last in this once doomed space.

Vfirst, before i delve into this review, i'm a huge fan of and am sure to tell other people of burgatory.  which is why it is so hard to write this review.\u000a\u000athis was not my first visit here, it was my second.  the first visit i made here ended up with me turning right around and walking away.  it was so crowded (on a tuesday night) that i just didn't even want to deal with the crowd.  funny thing is with this new location, instead of expanding it in any direction, it's still the same size as when the other restaurants that failed in this spot.\u000a\u000anow onto my most recent visit.  we showed up and there was a bit of a wait.  after giving our name to the hostess, we ventured over to the bar.  while at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar and have our experience of the place instead of sitting at a table (had to go back to the hostess to have our name removed from the wait list).  we both ordered some drinks, a fairly decent list of ipas on draft and we put in for an appetizer.  the truffled gorgonzola fries were pretty amazing.  when we ordered the burgers, that's when it went downhill for me.\u000a\u000ai opted for the make your own burger.  after scribbling and rewriting we had our orders down.  handed them over to the bartender and just had to wait.  i had ordered my burger topless (just the bottom of the bun).  when the burger arrived everything that my eyes could see at the time looked perfect.  whenever i cut into this delicious display of beefiness, that when i got to see what was underneath.  the bun was soggy, not the type of soggy that you get from the juices of the burger, or the wetness of the fresh vegetables, but soggy in the pink kind of way.  i was a little concerned about this and informed the bartender i would not be eating this.  while i give him credit for trying to explain to me that the pinkness to my bun was just the juices running of the burger patty, i had to disagree with him.  mind you, i ordered my burger cooked to medium well, if there were any juices from the burger they sure as hell would not be pink.  there was no smell to it either, so it could not have been a dressing for a salad.\u000a\u000aafter a trip to the kitchen the bartender came back out to me and said that the cook said that's how they cook.  i'm sorry, but that doesn't make me want to eat the burger any more than the fact that i can see with my own eyes that the bun portion was pink.\u000a\u000ain the end, they offered to make me another burger (i assumed it would have been free, but wasn't).  i opted to have it to go, good thing i did, by the time all this was over and the burger was ready my friend had finished her meal.  the manager came over as well and apologized to me for the mistake made and after handing me my bag with my new burger in it, she also handed a coupon thing for a free milkshake the next time i visit (thanks a million for that, giving me a coupon for something free that i cannot not use because of a food related allergy).\u000a\u000ato sum it all up, even though this place is literally like ten minutes from my house, i'll stick to the original spot and not take my chances again.

Vi came here for dinner the other night. the service was good. i ordered my hamburger well done but when i started eating it i noticed it was slightly pink in the middle. it was no big deal so i just ate it that way. burgatory is nice but pricey so i won't come here as often as i do eat n park.

Vso fresh!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000ai am so impressed with sawasdee thai! usually i'll wait to review a place until i've sampled a variety of things but this place is off the charts for inexpensive takeout/delivery. i just ordered tom kha and a vegetarian eggplant dish. the soup was incredibly flavorful and full of fresh herbs and veggies... thee best tom kha i've had to date! i requested my eggplant at a spice level 7 and it did not disappoint! \u000a\u000ai will definitely be eating here again and recommend it to anyone who likes fresh food fast.

Vquite nice. small, casual, and reasonably priced. i'd recommend the tom yum soup, spicy basil, and fresh rolls! byob. this amount of food was about right for two people of moderate hunger.

Vthe barrelhouse has a wonderful vibe to it.  i've been 3 times since it has opened and i love the ambiance.  they have some live music events with no cover, and these are definitely worth checking out.  the staff here is very friendly and helpful.  the only catch is the limited parking.  there's a small lot about a block away, but that fills up quickly.

Vthis is a new frozen yogurt place that just opened in the waterfront, right across from lowes theater. there are around a dozen frozen yogurt flavors and lots of toppings to choose from. my favorite fro-yo flavor is chocolate and one of my favorite toppings is the waffle pieces. i really like the spoons- they change colors! these are good quality spoons that can be reused many times. \u000a\u000a if you've never been to a froyo place before, the staff is more than willing to tell you how it works. don't forget: at the end your cup of yogurt will be weighed by the ounce. don't think you have to fill up your cup completely or else you will be paying a lot more.

Va cute little bed and breakfast located right on the allegheny river. they have pleasant landscaping, a covered indoor pool, hammock, chickens, and chairs right by the river to enjoy the view. i have not actually spent the night here, but would give it a try if i was coming to pittsburgh. the only possible drawback is that it's located fairly close to washington boulevard, so there is some traffic noise on that side of the property.

Vbottom dollar is a welcome discount food store to the city of pittsburgh. this particular newly opened location is in garfield on the friendship/ garfield border. they are very similar to aldi's. you bring your own bags and at this location you will need a quarter to use a shopping cart. there is no deli, bakery or bank. \u000a\u000awhere bottom dollar shines is in their produce and meat department. the quality and prices cannot be beat. the produce is in a separate cold room area. the employees are very nice and helpful. they're always bringing out boxes of fresh products to keep the shelves stocked. other chains could learn a thing or two from them. (wal-mart and giant eagle i'm looking at you!) you can find just about everything you could need in a store a little bigger than an aldi's. parking at times can be pretty difficult so be patient or just park on the street.\u000a\u000abottom dollar offers brand names and a private label called "my essentials". they even have a dollar isle where you can get tons of good deals for a dollar. be sure to sign up for their free membership card to get even more savings. on the day i went all of the staff i delt with were very nice and friendly and seemed to really love their job.\u000a\u000abottom dollar won't take out giant eagle, shop n' save, community market or aldi 's but, given the current state of the economy they are a welcomed new sometimes cheaper alternative.

Vi'm not a huge fan of bd, i just don't see the difference as many others do.  the product is basically the same and pricing doesn't really seem like it differs from other grocery spots throughout the city.  where you think you are saving a few cents the product doesn't justify the special trip here.\u000a\u000athe sales they offer aren't all that great either.  especially when you can price match at other businesses closer to where you live.  \u000a\u000athis particular spot is new.  just built actually.  parking lot is a bit confusing to navigate as people really don't care if you are attempting to back out of your parking spot.  keeping in mind that this place is new can somebody please answer me this: why does it smell like a cat litter box here?

Vwe only came here because la palapa was full with a 45 minute wait, we were starving, this was across the street, and they could seat us immediately. sad disappointment. next time i'll get takeout from la palapa, or make a reservation there. \u000a\u000ato be fair, the chipotle salsa was okay, but the chips were extra tough, and the pile was about four times too large for the amount of salsa.\u000a\u000awe tried the beet tacos (interesting, but not amazing), and the fish tacos (downright bad). the rice and beans included as side dishes weren't great either. i think this place mainly caters to the college drinking crowd, but i wouldn't go here for the food. the bathroom was also completely out of soap which is a little gross.

Vthis event started off not so great but, got better at the finish.\u000a\u000ai had heard nothing but great things about benjamin's for a while now but, i never got a chance to check them out until now. i love burgers so i knew i would like this place. i wish the event had been post poned to another night though due to the pirate wildcard baseball game as street parking on western ave was pretty tough to find. it took me at least 10 minutes of circling the block before a parking space opened up. \u000a\u000aonce parked and inside i walked in and had no idea where to go so i walked to the back and saw the yelp banner in the pool table area. upon checking in i got myself a sangria and walked to the second seating area in the back as everyone was already hanging out on the couches.\u000a\u000aa few minutes later i finally got to meet my yelp buddy carrie w and her hubby matt. about ten minutes later food started to come around but, our table wouldn't get any as the servers were out of food before they reach where we were seating. this was the continuing theme for the evening unfortunately.\u000a\u000athe first thing we tried was the smoked salmon (pastrami style cured salmon, capers, dill aioli, on a crostini) it was a good start. \u000a\u000anext we tried the shrimp and grits on a spoon. (byrd's mill organic corn grits, habanero cheddar cheese, brown sugar and butter.) they were one of the best things served all night! we then saw what looked like a pulled pork slider go around but, we never got to taste it as the servers always ran out before reaching our table. \u000a\u000awe also got to try a slider of the veggie slider (chick peas, roasted sweet potatoes, poblano peppers, caramelized onions & rosemary). i will not becoming vegan anytime soon but, i must say, it was very tasty!\u000a\u000awe even got to try a crab cake slider. being that i have been to baltimore countless times i think i know a thing or two about crab cakes. this was a very good one as it was seasoned and cooked perfectly.\u000a\u000athen out of no where the star of the show arrived. the candied jalapeno slider! (candied jalapeno cream cheese & apple wood smoked bacon) it was absolutly amazing and was the best thing we had all night.\u000a\u000aand just when you thought it was over we got a bowl with three differnent scoops of antny's icecream. one apple pie, one ginger and one of pumpkin. it was so good!\u000a\u000ai was surprised the owner didn't come out and greet and or talk to us. as aj. s said, a buffet line would have been perfect as to make sure evryone got to try everything they wanted to. all in all a nice event though. \u000a\u000ai will be back for a full sized version of the shrimp and grits and candied jalapeno burger stat!

Vmore of like 3.5 stars.  like what was said prior, a buffet style setup would have worked wonderfully here.  observing from the outskirts of the crowd i saw a few things that were a bit disturbing.  as the food was being brought out, it really never made it past the people that were near the entrance.  i missed out on several items this way due to the abundance of people flocked around the pool table.  the scene was always the same, a tray would come out and then when and if that tray made it past the pool table there would be one item left on the tray (maybe a simple fix to that could have been to have had bigger trays).\u000a\u000aanother thing i really didn't like was the space and lack of seating.  i stood the majority of the night until i discovered the little outdoor patio.  that place was pretty magical.  i really felt like i was at somebody's place in a swank neighborhood in the city.  quite calming and i like how they were mindful of their neighbors.  also if you had the chance to take in the patio, you also got a chance to spy the chef preparing the bites, knowing and seeing that they were prepared fresh was an amazing perk.\u000a\u000ai was confused of the as to how long this went too.  there really was no end time stated.  so for me, when i felt like i was done was when i left.  which, as it seems from other reviews, was a bit premature.  wish i would have stuck around a bit more.\u000a\u000aparking wasn't bad, or maybe i got lucky by snagging a spot virtually right out front.  leaving wasn't bad either, got to take a trip down by the stadium and heard the roar (even though we lost :().\u000a\u000ait was great to see other yelp elites and the few i spoke with were really nice.  it was great to see you all.

Vwhere do i start with this event?!\u000a\u000aeverything was pretty great. from the great harvest bread co to wheel and wedge and even the famous gaucho parrilla argentina was present to spoil us with their meaty carnivore delights!\u000a\u000ai had never been to the pittsburgh winery as i'm not a wine drinker but that didn't matter as this was still a great event. \u000a\u000aonce i entered i was greeted by the hostess and told to go down stairs. upon entering the lower level it defiantly did fill like dracula's liar as rochelle h. put it. i love all the red and dimmed lighting. i will be bringing my wife here for date night drinks sometime soon since she couldn't make the event. \u000a\u000ai then made my way over to the table with the great harvest bread co bread and wheel and wedge cheese to sample some of their wares. the popeye bread was delicious and so were all of the cheeses.\u000a\u000abeing the meat lover that i am my favorite vendor of the night had to be gaucho (duh!). i can't wait to visit them as they were so gracious the entire evening and even thanked us elite yelpers for all of the love and reviews good and bad that they have received. such a class act. the pork dish was amazing. it was like a mini pork salad. the dressing was fantastic and made the dish. the beef, potato and horseradish dish was good also. i also really enjoyed the shrimp and rice dish. \u000a\u000aa lot of other future vendors could learn a lot from gaucho as they were hustling the entire night. they keep up with demand and never ran out of food and even started to bring food to people's tables near the end of the night.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is that only a few tables had paint on them to paint our wine glasses and a lot of people who had paint on their tables got an attitude when asked if they could share their paint. \u000a\u000aother than that it was another great event.

Vwhat a fun event!  i brought my husband along as we are both fans of the pittsburgh winery.  we didn't do much sampling, we both tried the petite syrah and the red blend and then bought a glass of each.\u000a\u000awe thought gaucho stole the show as far as the vendors went--although the food from everywhere was great!  we are glad to have a great harvest in pittsburgh, as we were big fans of the one in omaha.  wheel and wedge had some interesting cheese offerings and we will be checking out their public market space the next time we are there.
