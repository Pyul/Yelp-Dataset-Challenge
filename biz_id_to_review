Vdelivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area.  no matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  try house of lee instead.

Vi am shocked to see this place isn't five stars. \u000a\u000awe order delivery from here at least once a week. their lunch specials are great, and the portions are always, always plentiful. i've never waited more than 25 minutes, even though they always say 45. i think it's respectful just in case they run behind. \u000a\u000ai will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic chinese meal, this probably isn't your best option (although way more authentic than house of lee. yuck!) both my boyfriend and i think it is plenty authentic for us, always delicious. i have cravings for their eggrolls daily, he loves their wonton soup. it is the only kind of soup i will eat, it's that good. \u000a\u000aand we love the cute, little chinese guy that usually delivers our food. my bf and i always get the biggest smiles on our faces when we hear our apt buzz with " china seeaaa!!" =)

Vwhether you live in ben avon heights, brighton heights - or anywhere in between - i urge you to try china sea.  it is quite simply the best local chinese delivery.  the people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  the delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  some favorites of ours are the kung pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  i don't mean to compare china sea to the higher end chinese restaurants in our area.  it is not sesame inn or china palace; it is not a "date night out" sort of place. it most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality "stay in and relax" go to.  hope this helps!  enjoy!\u000a\u000aps\u000aa few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.\u000apps\u000aalways look at their online coupons, you will get something free!

Vwow. what a shame. my family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. we are a very large family and love foods of all kind. we've eaten chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. i'll never order from here again. quite frankly, the fact that i took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. my complaints fell on deaf ears. i guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. i understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. it happens. but when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. not at this place. i was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. i guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  too bad. because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. this family of 7 won't be visiting china sea ever again. oh, and by the way, why can't i give this place zero stars?

Vthe pros:\u000ayou get a ton of food for your money. if the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... leftovers. \u000athey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \u000a\u000a\u000athe cons:\u000athe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. you try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \u000amy pork dumplings were "fried" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \u000aeverything was pretty darn salty. yeah, i get it. chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \u000aleftovers... yes this is also a con because i threw it away. suffering through it once was enough! \u000a\u000aif you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for chinese takeout.

Vwe ordered from here because uncle chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \u000a\u000ai ordered the general tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef mei fun noodles. we always grab some egg rolls too. the lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and i had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). i was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. price was good, typical takeout rates. the good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. she told me 45 minutes for the food.\u000a\u000athe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. hubby's mei fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. the beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. the veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. my general tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish i was craving. fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. the broccoli was fresh and tasted good. this particular dish only came in one size: enormous. i think hubby and i just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\u000a\u000aso, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. if you're looking for a quick fix to your chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although i'll be going back to uncle chen before i try china sea again.

Vthis place is kind of a hybrid of applebee's and cpk, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. i got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). the food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an applebee's knockoff (and applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway). \u000a\u000a3 stars

Vgood food.  \u000a\u000ai guess one reason i like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. there is a little kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  all in all i get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them\u000a\u000athe steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.\u000a\u000aservice is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat

Vi didn't know what to expect when i walked in, but i am now a fan. there is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count. \u000a\u000athe place looked nice. it was clean and really cool looking. the food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly. i will be going back to try their pizza and other food. \u000a\u000awe had a burger, which was really good, and we had the lobster slider. french fries were good to.

Vi don't care what cub and bulls fans think, this steeler and penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. first, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. i will give unos a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias in the area. when i look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. guess what? chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!

Vnot quite authentic but good enough for pittsburgh. it's the only place that i've found that even comes close to a classic chicago style deep dish.\u000ai also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. the croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.\u000a\u000amy girlfriend really enjoyed her caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.\u000a\u000aoverall, i enjoyed it and would come back the next time i get a craving for a deep dish pizza. it wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.

Vi really don't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore.  now that my palate has matured and i no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, i really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \u000a\u000amy husband and i were running errands at the waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  we decided on uno because pizza sounded good to us.  my husband is a meat lover, so i agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  to counteract this a little, i ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \u000a\u000awhen the salad arrived, it did not look like the picture.  the menu description is thus: "chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup."  this description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate "drizzling" of balsamic syrup.  it looks light and yummy.\u000a\u000awhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, completely drenched in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  it was disgusting.  there was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  i suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \u000a\u000athe "numero uno" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  it was ok... very mediocre.  the crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  i have been to chicago many times, had real chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \u000a\u000athe only positive i give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  it would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  they are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  i'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  if you're listening, uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   their hearts will applaud you.  \u000a\u000aand lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement i don't know about?  it's baffling.

Vi really love deep dish pizza. the thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. the mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. that being said, i really don't understand why people go to pizzeria uno. this chain has done to the deep dish pizza what mcdonald's has done to hamburgers, pizza hut has done to pan pizza, dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and taco bell has done to tex-mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. on our menu:\u000a\u000afrench onion\u000achicken bites\u000apizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\u000a\u000alooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza i have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \u000a\u000ai really never want to return.

Vcame here on a monday night.  boy was the place dead!  i was the only only customer at 8:30pm.  ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms.  it was pretty good.  could of used more cheese.   i wasn't in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza. this is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the us.  it was just like the others.  the caesar salad with anchovies was very good.  the service was very poor.  my waitress spent a lot of time chit-chatting with the hostess.  it was a chore to get water refills from her.  \u000a\u000athey have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant.

Vi ate here at around 8:00 on a saturday night.  reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant i was.  sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  you should know that going into any chain, really.  it was basically exactly what i expected in terms of food quality and price.\u000a\u000awe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  i ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which i would prefer receiving my food.  \u000a\u000amy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  it was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  i had the potato skin appetizer.  it reminds me of a "baked potato pizza" that i used to enjoy at a local place back in buffalo.  it was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.\u000a\u000aoverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an uno's in chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  it won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to chicago.

Vmy girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last saturday. i highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. there were people there waiting 30 minutes+. we had the sangria which was amazing. our sever alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  i had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. my two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  i will be back for sure.

Vpizza ok on it's own nothing great . definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria uno in chicago. are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.

Vthe menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. for 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. the personal pizzas alone were $11 each... if you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good.

Vwell this visit started off good. i was seated right away, no wait. was given a good beer selection of some pa craft beers. ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. was never asked if i wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. my pizza still had onions in it. which i stated right off the bat, that i didn't blame the girl who took my order. i know cooks can't read. i was one for many years. mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. no complaints, still ate the food and it was good. just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \u000a\u000anow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. i already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. she goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if i felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. i took this as a joke as i had told her earlier i worked in the industry. when i hand over the gift card i had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. and again if i felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. let me explain one thing and hopefully i am very clear on it. no server, and i mean no server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! so out of kindness, which i shouldn't have left anything by this point. i left a nice tip for the cost of what food i did  have to pay for.\u000a\u000abottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as i don't know how the rest of the servers are. was just horrible.

Vi think the location in homestead has ruined this place. dirty dirty dirty.\u000a\u000abathrooms unkept, entry door handle and windows filthy\u000a\u000apizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched. server was coarse, not refined\u000a\u000aserving items were old and rusty. temperature of food was not hot\u000a\u000alow quality, but probably ok with pittsburgher s

Vunos has been around for ever, & i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80's. honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.\u000a\u000aif you haven't died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!\u000a\u000athey have the best chicken salad wrap ever! i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch.  full disclosure:  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.\u000a\u000alisten... the food and pizza and service are very good, surprisingly so! i don't know why this place is not busier but next time you're down at the waterfront please do consider dining here!

Vall in favor of a deep dish pizza say i!.......iiiiiii,  ok now that i have that out of my system. this place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. i hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. i was so glad they were paying cause  i was low on funds at the time.\u000a\u000awe arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. we waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. we looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. \u000a\u000aafter ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. we both are going gluten free which is tough but uno's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. plus! they make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. my hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and i ordered the guac-alicious burger with a caesar side salad. my salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. i didn't complain, it still tasted great.\u000a\u000ai'm not into red meat so i tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. the burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. very saddening. i ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. i snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. \u000a\u000awe came here twice in one week. the second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. was this pizza amazing or what?? i will probably always eat this pizza whenever i come. \u000a\u000aonly down side is slow service. it took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. he got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!

Vwham! 4 stars outta the park! the deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. i wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. great service too from maranda, a doll. decor is cute. ambience is lively. recommended.

Vpizza is a staple for me. i love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. i have never tried chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. \u000a\u000aonly a 30 minute wait for a saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the waterfront. we were seated at a booth in the bar area. the tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. good news, only happened twice!\u000a\u000athe four of us decided to order two pizzas, the pepperoni and the farmers market. i also ordered a caesar salad because i needed more vegetables in my life.  \u000a\u000athe salad. it was a big salad that i shared with my boyfriend. the croutons were huge and very crunchy. the caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a "bite" to it as chris kept on saying. i thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am i to say.  the lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like i requested. \u000a\u000athe main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. i do not know what i was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as i was imagining. two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. but!!!! i was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. \u000a\u000athe farmers market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, sun dried amazing tomatoes, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. the crust was perfection being so crisp and light that i stole chris' extra from his plate. the sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that i went looking for the slices with the most on them. it was a really really good pizza. we even ended up taking slices home with us! my eyes deceived me at first with the size! \u000a\u000athen our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. cookie pizza? what sorcery is this? matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. this cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. it had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. warm, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. oh sweet heavens, it was good. i am glad that i had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. \u000a\u000achicago pizza, i would absolutly try again.

Vi had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  the individual size was smaller than i expected for $12 but i wasn't starving so it was very filling.  our waitress april was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  we had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  i can't wait to try it again!

Vmy friend and i have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. for a thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. there were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. we ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). i was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. i even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. this wasn't bad for a first visit so i will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. i'm only giving uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. hello! the plate was yellow! how could she not have seen that?!

Vwell, it started well. food was okay. deep dish pizza was good. but the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\u000awe were greeted and seated well. but later the service was not all good. bad bad service. first of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. the server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. she just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\u000alater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said "okay", not even a sorry once!!!\u000ai would not like to go there again... :(

Vwhile visiting relatives in somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of homestead.  my aunt insisted that we have lunch at uno's pizzeria & grill as the food was delicious.  when we arrived i had to admit that i was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  it was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  i settled on a turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  they have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  the food arrived in no time and was delicious!  the portions were just right for lunch, i was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  the four of us had items off the two for u lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that i might could afford the shoes i wanted to buy!  my aunt was right, you cannot visit homestead without stopping to eat at uno pizzeria & grill, it is fantastic!!

Vit gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. back before pizza hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the pizza hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. and this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out. \u000a\u000aso this is the old style pizza hut. \u000a\u000avery family orientated dining style. you can sit here for hours. and so we did. we had a heap of use in a long table.\u000a\u000ai ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. disappointed in the selection of that. seeing other choices... i regretted going on the cheap. \u000a\u000aprices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. can't say i walked away hungary. nor did i finish my second mini pizza. \u000a\u000ai want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!

Vlast week was my first visit to this place. the raspberry tea was amazing. we got the app sampler,  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole. i ordered a side salad, hardly any dressing on it, and not very fresh. i ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables.  waited along time for the entrée.  the chicken was good but a small portion.  the broccoli & veggies were water logged. lots of water on the plate. tried my friends fried shrimp, it was good with good flavor. might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so i would give it another shot.

Va decent italian restaurant serving delicious fresh made bread with hummus, flat breads, salads, soups, and pasta. outdoor seating is available in nice weather, and the service is friendly. overall, not a bad place, but not super exciting either - pino's suffers from its close proximity to the excellent  point brugge cafe. it also gets quite noisy inside so it's hard to carry on a conversation, and seems to attract a somewhat older crowd of people.

Vi wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at point brugge cafe.  while my friends and i were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  i'm glad he did!  the menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular pointe brugge up the street: mussels and fries.\u000a\u000ait happened to be lasagna night.  because i am used to the home cooked variety, i had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  i selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  both were very good.  the gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  didn't get a chance to try dessert.\u000a\u000aboth items i had were rather tasty, and i would easily come back here for a great meal.

Vi made it back here about two weeks ago.  i must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of july.  whether or not it was an off night i do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  i should have just waited it out at point brugge.  i won't becoming back anytime soon.

Vi've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  we literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering.

Vi often have lunch at the nearby point brugge cafe, but i decided to give pino's a try today for a change of pace.  bad idea.  my lady friend and i started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and "italian frites."  the latter, which the menu described as "fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic," were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  the greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 freakin' dollars for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  talk about a profit margin!\u000a\u000aas a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  it was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the fm radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a "nice" restaurant?  classless.\u000a\u000aconclusion: i'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at point brugge than be seated immediately at pino's.

Vit's a shame that some of the other reviewers had poor experiences. i discovered pino's after deciding that the wait for point brugge simply wasn't worth it.\u000a\u000athe brunch was very good, i enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the "missing" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.\u000a\u000amy sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition.

Vi must admit that the first time i went to pino's (about 6 months ago), i was not a fan for several reasons.  however, after coming home from brunch, the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind, but to keep me coming back.\u000a\u000amy boyfriend had the scallops and i have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  my boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  his eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  he said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.\u000amy dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.  \u000a\u000aoverall, i am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  we'll definitely be back for brunch.

Vpino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. a relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in point breeze would be to enjoy the amazing point brugge cafe just down the street. as a previous reviewer mentioned, i stopped in simply because the brugge was full, but i unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.

Vwhat a disappointment!! evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \u000awe had reservations for 5 people at 7pm this past saturday. two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. she was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. when the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), i informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  she told me it would be awhile. huh? when asked what "awhile" was, she said 20min.  but then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which i take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\u000a\u000afood was a let down. potato latkes were greasy and blah.  fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  others had the same sentiments.\u000a\u000aservice was rough.  long waits and lack of attentiveness. noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\u000anot sure pino's will get a repeat visit.  disappointment:(

Vin similar fashion to joseph s. i, too, decided to give pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby point brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. it was a relatively nice evening, and i thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. we were immediately greeted by jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. i made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that i found to be very interesting. \u000a\u000ai really loved the bistro burger. i requested it to be prepared "medium", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times i've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. we also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. i thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. we really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. i was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. my partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which i found to have that "homemade" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado i was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. \u000a\u000aoverall we loved our experience and will be back! we were told about pino's legendary sunday brunches, and i look forward to trying one myself the next sunday i have off from work.

Venjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect pittsburgh spring night.  the charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  i had the best pasta and white clam sauce i've ever experienced, and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees, as well.  nice find in the point breeze neighborhood.

Vtasty option for sunday brunch \u000a\u000ai've read the reviews and what seems to ring true is that pino's has a good sunday brunch. thankfully that's when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely! \u000a\u000abrunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some italian twists. my mum had challah french toast and loved it. pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - i tried that and it had a nice kick to it.\u000a\u000aother folks at the table had the eggs benedict, salad, and sammy. over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out. \u000a\u000aand for the music complainer (you whining stinker) we had a nice ipod mix on when we were there!

Vmy favorite italian restaurant in pittsburgh.  all-time favorite dish:  eggplant parmesan with their spicy arrabbiata sauce, i had to ask for them to make it that way.  not your typical layers of fried, heavy eggplant--lighter, chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth.  my favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful to eat!  flavor explodes in your mouth!  also good is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate.  we typically go on less crowded days, as the restaurant is small--but we've always had excellent service and the food comes out hot and fresh!

Vbefore pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing italian food. it was also a byob, which i love. this was our "go-to" restaurant.\u000a\u000aafter pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. while the interior is now very nice, it's no longer a byob, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of pino himself.\u000a\u000aon our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 pm. we arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 pm. pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly un-apologetic. there were no open tables, despite having reservations. when 8:00 pm rolled around, i was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. no such luck, since it was prime dining time on saturday night. finally, around 8:30 pm, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\u000a\u000athe food is still good here, but i refuse to give my money to someone who clearly does not appreciate your business. there are so many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the point brugge cafe.

Vsix of us went to dinner, six of us had fabulous meals!  my husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate, not a bit fishy--loaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce.  my son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  my daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal (it is a large appetizer), and i also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly.  my father had the skirt steak which he loved, and my son had a sausage pizza.  both said they were delish!  i usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time i had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  it was excellent!  \u000a\u000ait was my father's birthday, and they brought out a tiramisu for us to share (we didn't even ask for it), and that was luscious as well!  the staff was as nice as can be--we will be back without a doubt!\u000a\u000ai love this place!

V"god this is the best eggplant that i have ever tasted!"  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the sicilian eggplant served at pino's.  my husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo, which he had last time...again, a 10 out of 10!  i had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and i had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at pino's) was that it was the best italian dressing that he ever had.  as i write, i want to go back for dinner tonight!!\u000a\u000aforgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (east end brewery), the men enjoyed the homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses!

Vi went to pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a thursday night.  i hadn't been in pino's since they renovated, but i have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  we made reservations, but i don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \u000a\u000amy two girlfriends and i always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  we started with the charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  this was an impressive way to start out the meal.  we all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  this was unlike other pumpkin ravioli i've had...very pumpkiny.  the ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  it was very sweetly spiced and i was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \u000a\u000ai ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  i admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that i was dreaming about later that night.  overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \u000a\u000athe service was outstanding.  our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  my friends got dessert, and when the chef (i assume chef pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  talk about service!  the whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \u000a\u000aadded bonus:  awesome beer selection, some brews i haven't seen.  only place i've been that had east end homewood reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).

Vi have had lunch at pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. usually i am there  for a business lunch when i am in the area. i find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch we have several times asked the chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. to me this is excellent service. makes you feel like coming back.\u000ai would have to admit that i usually order the garlic fries which are really great. i do this if i am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.\u000anormally i would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day. \u000ai have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  i would make it 3 1/2 stars.

Vthe food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? me thinks not.\u000a\u000awhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. i heard it used to be much better but now i don't know anyone who eats there...

Vanother really good meal here!  my friend and i went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  so much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  they also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!

Vi ate here this past friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  we decided to come here because it was pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  it ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of point breeze which i had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\u000a\u000athe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  i decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  my salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  it was nothing amazing but i think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  i also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since i do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  for my entree i decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  the tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  my mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  there was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and i liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  i was also able to try the arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  immediately i regretted not ordering it although i still did enjoy my two small plates.  for my dessert course i ended up having the white chocolate creme brulee.  my girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  all of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  my creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\u000a\u000athe bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future.  their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that i had tried throughout the night was good.

Vi decided to try pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am i glad that i did! my husband and i made reservations for four on friday night. we were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. it was a great night to be outside. although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. i could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.\u000a\u000athe table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. we each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. i started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. the pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. for my entree, i chose the arrabiata with rigatoni. the dish was very good but much more spicy than i had expected. i feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. luckily, i enjoy spicy food but i was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. it was slightly less spicy when i finished it for lunch the next day. my husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. for dessert, i orderedthe peach mille feuille. the portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. however, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. i had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. \u000a\u000aoverall, i would definitely recommend pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in point breeze. however, i wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.

Vi grew up just the street from pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. i've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... the decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? it claimed to be "fresh pasta," but it was completely tough and chewy (not "al dente," just undercooked), and not very large. i'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but i think it really missed the mark... people want a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. why take that away?

Vwent here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \u000a\u000awe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \u000a\u000aour waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\u000a\u000athe meal started out with some what i guess used to be foccacia.  i say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\u000a\u000awe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \u000a\u000athen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \u000a\u000athe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \u000a\u000afinally the diver scallops.  this dish was indeible.  the scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty i was unable to eat it. we sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \u000a\u000aafter that we decided against dessert and left.  i probably will not return.

Vi struggle with this review. i wish i could give it a 4, but i really can't hate on it like everyone else. their wait staff has always been super attentive and friendly, and their happy hours are great! but, a lot of their entrees are a little meh for me, especially for the price. stick to happy hour for wine/cheese platters, and enjoy a nice summer evening here.

Vthe fresh-baked bread and sun-dried tomato puree is outstanding. we started with the crab cakes, which was one of the lightest i've had. i could eat a vat of the lemon aioli itself. we followed with veal and ricotta meatballs that were perfectly cooked. we finished with their italian fries. i would order these every single time now that i've had them once. twice cooked, herbs, garlic confit, basil aioli--every single element of the dish is fantastic.\u000a\u000aif you plan on visiting, then make sure you have some time to really take in the drink list and menu. there are always a handful of new, recommended wines to try and a signature cocktail of the week (which, might i add, is usually extremely fun and concocted with unique ingredients). i am impressed with the cleanliness, decor, and ambiance of the restaurant. i love the feel when the french doors are completely open. \u000a\u000ai also enjoyed our bartender, eamonn, who was funny, polite, and attentive. he is also a master of not only creating fresh, new, tasty cocktails but, simply, understands the right way to mix and serve a drink.\u000a\u000aoverall, i would love to keep pino's as our little secret but would urge you to try it too!

Vmy husband and i celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. verdict? it was so-so. we had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated outside! listen folks, it's cold when the sun goes down. they have three tables set outside, i guess trying to squeeze out some more business. our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  we were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. it took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. wine was good. food was ehhhhhh. we had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. my dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. espresso and a s'more cupcake for dessert and i grand total of $134 later before tip? definitely not worth it at all.  the best part of the night? leaving. the worst part of the night? associating this place with my anniversary.

Vstopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. i ordered the house soup. it was very yummy. the soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. i also tried the sausage flatbread. the flatbread sizing easily fed one. my boyfriend shared with me. the tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. \u000a\u000ai really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa

Vnice atmosphere with above average food. this restaurant has a lot of potential. the wait staff was far below average: they were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. they were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward.

Vwe were huge fans of pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. in all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying " we have to get to pinos!" needless to say, we were disappointed.  the place has changed and not for the better.  it seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  the menu has been scaled back considerably.  though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  i came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, i doubt we will return.  hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  customer advice for what it's worth.  refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!

Vi went to pino's with my three other friends for restaurant week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. we chose an option for each course of  the very limited restaurant week menu. i selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, lazy man lasagna florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \u000a\u000abaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \u000alazy man lasagna florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (i'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. the spinach ratio was out of control and i honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \u000apanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\u000a\u000amy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? why? \u000awe tried my friend's appetizer of the italian fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at point brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular french fries, which were lackluster and misleading. she also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\u000a\u000ai don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. all of it was overpriced and below mediocre. i wasted my money, and i will never, ever go back there.

Vi live in connecticut and visit family in pittsburgh often. pino's is my favorite pittsburgh restaurant. \u000a\u000ai don't have one favorite dish because i usually order one of the specials, which change often. i ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. the bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (i think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what i had in italy. my son had the seafood risotto. it was so good, i need to order it next time.\u000a\u000amy brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. he loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). he was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.\u000a\u000aoh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.\u000a\u000aoh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the belgium place around the corner, try pino's. the fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!\u000a\u000ano, it isn't cheap. but, i'm happy to pay for quality.

Vi went to pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. i guess i should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that i feel.\u000a\u000aafter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to "apologize". it was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. he then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would "never salt his steak again". i don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. she was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. we had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. so when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. the chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. well, i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. i said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. he proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \u000a\u000athe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! he ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \u000a\u000aoverall, embarrassing. it was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. take heed of the negative comments on this site. i certainly wish i would have.

Vvery disappointing meal.  after waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. very awkward.t.  salad was average at best.  the beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\u000a\u000a  then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  the chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \u000a\u000ato make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  it was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. he kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. i think i would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\u000a\u000along story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!

Vthis was the place i brought friends visiting from out of town when i wanted to show them the classy italian  spots in pittsburgh. after my visit last night, i have no desire to ever go again. \u000a\u000ai don't know the owner, joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said "dish looks beautiful." he was always confident in his food which i guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \u000a\u000athe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. the mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (i've never had the steak as i'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). the server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. the owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. at this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  the  best part? he comes out again and says "i really enjoyed the steak you sent back." he was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! i can't make stuff like this up!\u000aat this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. clearly an awkward situation. the owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said "it's not my job to make people happy" that's strange considering he wants our business. \u000aso the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\u000a\u000ai couldn't finish my dinner i was so mad.  maybe joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  sorry, we will never step foot in here again.

Vi have been going to pino's for several years with my family so i feel well qualified to give a balanced review rather than basing it on a single experience, good or bad. every restaurant can have a bad day. and even the worst places can please some customers every now and then. \u000a\u000awhat you get at pino's is great service and excellent food. if your idea of italian is the olive garden, you are in for an education and a treat. this is the real deal. we have a family of picky eaters including a full blown celiac and we all love it.\u000a\u000ayes, over the years i have twice seen owner/chef joe unhappy with unhappy customers. in one case the customer was arrogant and offensive. on the other occasion, joe should have swallowed his pride if only to avoid the coordinated revenge reviews that followed.

Vpinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  the food is tasty but not transcendent.  the prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  the food is essentially slightly hipper olive garden fare at double the prices.\u000a\u000afor dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  but it's not all bad.  the atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  i had a good time and i'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).\u000a\u000apino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  my friend and i were the only males there.  if cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in pino's jungle safari!

Vthis is one of the true sleepers of "neighborhood pittsburgh." since 1979, this "diner/family restaurant" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. the staff has been there as long.\u000a\u000athey have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. they also have my favorite pancakes. if you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, i assure you that it will be one of the best "old time" meals you'll ever have. \u000a\u000ai hate its name, but i love the rusty nail.

Vthe home-cooked breakfasts at the rusty nail in bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by bellevue locals.  that said, two stars is all i can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  i've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\u000a\u000adon't get me wrong, i adore that pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but i'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with cool mint listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  yes, the tables are packed that close together.  and whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.

Vi've been going here since i was a wee tot.  i have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  i really like their breakfast menu.  you always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice.  \u000a\u000amy only complaint is that it is way too small and always very busy.  they should really look at expanding the restaurant.

Vthe sunday brunches serve great pancakes, and i always felt so fancy eating here as a kid.  note that if you wait until the churches let out to get in line that there will be a long queue outside.  the rest of the menu ranges from decent to average, but the food is always cheap.  the tables are so close together it feels like you're crawling over your neighbors to be seated.  on nicer summer days and during any of the bellevue events, they often serve fresh lemonade or iced tea outside.

Vi really wanted to like the rusty nail.  i love little local restaurants like this.  but it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  we were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  and the food was.... just so bland!  i get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  to be fair, we did go for dinner, and i understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so i would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  for dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, i probably wouldn't return for seconds.

Vgiven that the rusty nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, i'm sad to say i was sorely disappointed. \u000a\u000athey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  however, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes and toast.  yes, that's right.  i had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  when my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  i did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which i ordered deep fried.  my dining companion ordered the french toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \u000a\u000awe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  the service was good.  and it's not that i thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, "meh, i've experienced better."  given the plethora of choices in bellevue, this will not be my first stop should i find myself on lincoln avenue for breakfast again.

Vi always see this place, and saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. the atmosphere was pleasant. my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. i however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. it was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. i'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as i was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. needless to say i don't think i will be returning.

Vi ate here this past sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  i have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  we were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  the rusty nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.\u000a\u000afor my entree i decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the rusty nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  it was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  the junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like i was eating healthy.  my omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like i was almost eating a pizza.  some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.\u000a\u000athe bottom line for me is that i would definitely head back here in the future.  everything that i tasted was good and i would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.

Va great pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. if there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. otherwise, it's an enjoyable place to eat and the food is, indeed, very good.

Vi had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. there was also a continuous flow of coffee, which is always nice. probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn't too busy either. definitely a good breakfast spot.

Vthe first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar. we were disappointed, but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner. it was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food. while there we couldn't help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of pittsburgh's best breakfast spots. so, sometime later, on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and i thought let's check out that rusty nail again. what a great decision. i think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. the only downside is they only take cash (that's not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn't very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait. well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lop-sided but hey i'd rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere.

Vi am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and the rusty nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.\u000a\u000ait's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. i've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.\u000a\u000arusty nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. in fact, i would imagine the sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. as long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. and indeed, all is fine.\u000a\u000aso few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that i can't call rusty nail a diner. it's a neighborhood family restaurant. period.\u000a\u000aburgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. fair and decent prices. friendly and attentive service. a cozy enough atmosphere (although i have to say again in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple tvs in the space, for gods sake, can one of them not be showing sports coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. \u000a\u000aduring my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. a nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. at one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped outside to have his conversation. as i was leaving i had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!\u000a\u000abottom line...rusty nail is comfortable. it's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. it is what it is. a great little neighborhood spot for the neighborhood. \u000a\u000abut do bring cash. the don't take credit cards. believe it or not, they will actually take a check.

Von our recent visit to pittsburgh my family and i had breakfast at the rusty nail in bellevue (dad's hometown).  the place is on the main street, lincoln ave (or up street as my family called it).\u000a\u000athey were quite busy on a saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  i enjoyed a sausage omelet with american cheese and my husband had a denver omelet.  the omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  all adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.\u000a\u000athe service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  it is cramped quarters, but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.\u000a\u000awe had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.  we will definitely go back when visiting pittsburgh.

Vchecked out the neighborhood restaurant for sunday brunch. the portions were generous and the omelets were very good. we felt that much of the food (e.g., sides) and service were just average. for example, we typically had to ask for coffee to be refilled. it is a great place to go for a quick bite to eat on a sunday morning, but i would not make a special trip to the restaurant.

Vplace has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. you get a really big side of home fries too. this is probably my favorite place for breakfast in pittsburgh. i generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. service is usually fast and friendly. two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. i never remember to have cash until i get my bill so i have to run to the atm. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. the lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!

Vthe food at joe's rusty nail is great. as the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. the service is quick, and the staff personable. i went there for breakfast and everyone in our group left sated!! as always i had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to everything edible that was put before them. while they are a tad (and i do mean tad)  bit pricey i believe that the food is more than worth it. the clientele (what i can only believe are bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. my breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. i will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. as i say i vote with my feet and my usd, and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash, will continue to flow at joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!

Vi will admit i am completely biased towards this place. i grew up eating their pizza. crust is soft and fluffy, not chewy. the cheese is a little thicker than the average new york style pizza place. the sauce has spice but not too much. at some places you need a little milk or water to cool your tongue. their one downside is that they're not always consistent. some days its just started to turn golden brown others its over done.

Veaten here twicebut only pizza. i do have to say its up there with napolis or ailleos as for the pizza. tonight me and my neighbors were up for some more. was disappointed when ordering a meatball hoagie to find out they had no meatballs! pizza places should never run out of certain things. had gotten a cheese hoagie. didnt get get why someone would order this, but was told it was good. didnt like. luckily the pep pizza was great, but.. when u get toward the crust, its all dough. still kick butt pizza but get rid of the cheese hoagie.

Vaccording to urbanspoon (blasphemy i know) their are like 1,100 pizza places in pittsburgh. so what is the best pizza in pittsburgh. everyone has an opinion and so here is mine: the best pizza in pittsburgh is the pie comes from the place in you neighborhood that has quality ingredients, fair prices, and friendly service. eddie's pizza place  is all of these things and since i live in this neighborhood this is my favorite.

Vdecent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. the sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  it has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? the pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for eddies.

Vtwo meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, i was compelled to write. 'rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\u000a\u000aon the first trip, i went to try their (at that time)raved about reuben. and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh, i tried it.\u000a\u000awell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' reubens, i received two mini-reubens, which basically took the guts from one reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. i ate it. it wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. bread or not, it still wasn't great. the atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the reuben.\u000a\u000athe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen tv covering the sports of the moment.\u000a\u000ai was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. my friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\u000a\u000awe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. it was a basic salad, no big deal. more or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\u000a\u000athe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when i placed my order. i asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. it literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. the first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of kentucky fried chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \u000a\u000aafter the second trip back i heard the cook holler 'tell him i'll fix him up'. \u000a\u000awell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\u000a\u000athank goodness for the basic salad bar.\u000a\u000aeven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. they also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\u000a\u000athe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. ahhhh da burgh.\u000a\u000athird base? nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\u000a\u000afrom what i understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. but apparently, mama has left the kitchen.

Vrocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  their food is good.  not haute cuisine, pretentious!  everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  i've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today i introduced an old friend to "linner" in the bar.\u000ahe ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  rocky's is famous for their fish.  three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\u000ai ordered the meatball grill.  it was delish.  served on thick cut italian bread and made "grilled cheese" (mozzarella) style.  meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  also, served with fries.  i brought home half the sandwich.\u000aanother good meal there.  friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food!

Vwhen you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned, nothin' fancy italian restaurant, you can't beat minutello's!  my husband rick and i didn't feel like cooking the other night so we came here for a nice casual dinner.  man, i haven't reviewed this place in nearly three years and it sure hasn't changed.  still has that good old basement decor.\u000a\u000aminutello's still has some of the best pizza in town.  rick and i ordered the supreme wtih capicola, italian sausage, salami, and pepperoni!  mm-mm good!  gotta hit that gym tomorrow.  and you know the best thing about ordering pizza, don't you?  it's always good the second day!

Vthis was one of the worst dinners out i've had in recent memory. on the other hand, i wasn't expecting much, so i guess the place lived up to my expectations. i've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best i can come up with is as follows. imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. in other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. there was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. to be fair, i only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... it's possible, although unlikely based on what i've seen.\u000a\u000aon the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! if you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.

Vi went to this place because i had a livingsocial voucher. even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money. i think i could have had better food if i went over to the giant eagle across the street and heated up a lean cuisine. i do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\u000athe only positives i can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. it was almost empty for a monday at 7 pm, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  again, it is advisable to be desperately starving.

Vbased on some recent reviews, it looks like the quality of food at minutellos has slipped a little bit.  still as i mentioned before, it's a shadyside institution located in the basement of an apartment building.  \u000a\u000aanyway, the main reason to come to minutellos is for the pizza.  my cousin and i did just that the other night when we were in the area.  we did the whole 'build your own pizza' thing, ordering ours with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  good pizza even if the place is beginning to look a little dated.

Vhome of the italian army.\u000a\u000avento's is located in the east liberty section of pittsburgh right next to home depot. they have been in business forever! they are a pizza and hoagie shop. they are famous for their italian army hoagie. i have friends that as soon as they land in pittsburgh they come straight to vento's for the pizza! it is sicilian style pizza and it is delicious! everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. it's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\u000a\u000athey have tables and booths for seating. you can even play the pa lottery there. \u000a\u000ano debit or credit cards. cash only!\u000a\u000a(f.y.i. there is a generic atm that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)

Vi had heard lots of good things about vento's. unfortunately i did not get to experience these things. the service was slow and lukewarm. the pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. also, no credit or debit cards here.  you're directed to the atm in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   i ordered ahead and although i had to wait for my pizza when i got there i received it cold and it just was not that good.  i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good.

Vventos is an east end tradition.   the sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   it is more of a traditional working-clasd pittsburgh style crust-square, and bread like.  sicilian pizza comes in square cuts by the way,  if you like the doughy (dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust, or brick oven designer pizza you might not like vento's pizza.  but i happen to love vento's pizza!!!   they also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  this is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  everything i've had from here is good.

Vwe were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. found this place, read reviews on yelp which were ok, and decided to ordered two slices. hum...sorry not slices. more like two squares of cheesy bread. when we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. we obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! they also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\u000ait also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. since i was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. definitely never going there if we come to visit again!

Vhorrible food don't waste your money\u000a\u000athis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza i've ever had, i haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. idk where that place is cuz the one i wan in today in east liberty by the home depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\u000a\u000aloudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. not one person there had decent customer service skills i had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and i have excellent hearing. i ordered a small pizza i got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \u000a\u000ai looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.

Vwhat a wonderful hidden gem!\u000amy boyfriend and i have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  the service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful.  the food isn't 5 star, but it is really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!\u000asure the pizza may not be cut into "pizza shape," but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  everything i have ever had here is wonderful and i will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business.

Voh i love this place. their pizzas are square/rectangle! a single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. it is in the strangest location (home depot's parking lot)!! the picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. love this place!

Vthis place has the worst service i've ever seen. i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. when i got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! so i waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. the "workers" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. i had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. do not go here!

Vmy cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. the crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. it makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable.\u000a\u000ai always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because i love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza. plus if you dip it in ranch (big fattie) it taste even better. \u000a\u000ai took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good. they have tons of specials and even more menu options. we ordered the medium pie and 12" hoagie for only $13. really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad. i do wish however that it was a little thicker. maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. by the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. still delicious but i would have like a little more bite in my hoagie.\u000a\u000athe interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. \u000a\u000abtw, it's cash only here, but they do have an atm.

Va group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. we where the only normal people in this place. the kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. you had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. while we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. must i say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.

Vby far the worst mcdonald's in the world.  employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  i've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my big mac.  save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.

Vyou know it's bad when a mcdonald's gets a 1 star review...i mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a mcdonald's. the whole point of going to mcdonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. in my case, i just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in kennywood would. i hadn't even eaten at a mcdonald's in about eight years or so. and i quickly remembered why!\u000a\u000aforget the fact that mcdonald's food isn't great. we all know it's not great. the problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. for starters, i quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the absolute slowest line on planet earth. you certainly won't be getting any fast food here! then, once i finally placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course i spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. i waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized i was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. whatever, i figured, forget the receipt; by then i was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. on to the next window, where i was given my food and drink...and i proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my big mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? i give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\u000a\u000ai concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. completely. just keep driving. anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it.

Vby far the absolute worst mcdonalds in the\u000aworld. you can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  calls to the owner go ignored. rice enterprises own a majority of the mcdonalds in the south hills.  they have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  the owner has to be the problem.

Vchina garden appears to be your run of the mill chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but i was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  we had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  i'd easily say this is the best chinese takeout place i've found since i've been in pittsburgh (about a year).  highly recommend it.

Vi've said it before, and i'll say it again, i love me a buffet.\u000a\u000aan excellent price for some good food never hurts.  all the usual chinese fare is on the buffet with that american flare added for some spice...i suppose it would be to spice it up...  anyway  i got to taste all my favorite chinese foods from general tso's to cheese won tons.  just in case i didn't want to overdose on chinese i decided to try some of the mac n' cheese and fried potatoes (although i admit i added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).  \u000a\u000aservers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.  \u000a\u000ai would have given five stars, but as my friend pointed out while we were there, our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  next time i'll go with the soda i suppose.

Vthis is my go-to place for curing a hangover. i don't know what it is about chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. i also like to come here before i go grocery shopping at the nearby trader joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.\u000a\u000aall of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, i haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. another thing i miss is creamed spinach... i have yet to see this dish on a pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among chines buffets.\u000a\u000aanother star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.

Vthe hot and sour soup was ok. everything else was basically inedible. water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. more than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be "krab", considering the price of the buffet. no pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup.

Vthe food here is good but it is not exceptional. \u000a\u000a i've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. there is the typical asian fare such as general tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. there is also american macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. \u000a\u000awhen i go to china garden, i always request a carry out container as i find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. one thing for sure is that china garden gets plenty of customers.\u000a\u000adefinitely come here for a reasonably priced buffet!

Vjust ate there, right next to gamestop & google, has 3 small booths, & ordered the pepper steak w/ onion ($10.95). food is fast fresh & hot, but mine had too much onion & not enough steak. at the end of the meal i was just eating onions with rice, though i hear this is healthy for you. counter lady was cordial, but didn't reply when customers told her, "have a nice day" #awkward. i know that english isn't her first language but she needs to catch on that people are wishing her well. wasn't stuffed full either despite having eaten a large plate (i usually get this feeling eating asian). this is basically a nice place to go for lunch that won't ruin your appetite for dinner. (side note: food is very clean. brushed my teeth an hour before w/ tom's of maine fluoride-free peppermint & still had minty fresh breath an hour after eating)

Vthis is my 2nd time here and i thought that i attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact i was sooooo hungry. well my 2nd time and for a chinese buffet, this place is fantastic. the restaurant itself is very clean. the buffet is also very clean and even though i showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. the amount of choice is less than just about all the chinese buffets that i have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. all the patrons here are american, so this isn't the asian place where the asians eat. it's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. i would certainly return. giving it 7.5 knuckles out of 11.

Vthis is an average chinese buffet. the food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap american food. the food was a little too greasy even by american chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after i left that place. to me, that's a no-go signal.\u000a\u000aon the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there.

Vi think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... the chicken is quality meat and its lightly sautéed but the sauce is to blah. it's a nice place to sit down and have chinese food if you have no other local options.  \u000a\u000ait's my last resort for chinese food in the area. prices are absurd!!!

Vi have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  king's family restaurant has surprised me with this.  i think it might be in direct dialogue with eat n' parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  we were seated rather quickly by the manager.  very nice people work here, i was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.\u000a\u000awe chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:\u000a\u000atea\u000apepsi\u000aopen-faced hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy\u000abuffalo chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese\u000a\u000aour drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  she would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  i went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  it didn't taste bad, but i swear that it is made by stouffers.  i didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  i tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  i moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  at least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  i contented myself with eating them.  \u000a\u000ai tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  i finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  no, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad.

Vso... back in the late 90s, there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream, like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust.  so delicious!\u000a\u000ahowever, now there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so i only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.\u000a\u000athe portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream.

Vive pretty much been eating at various kings' pretty regularly since i was a child when my parents would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often.  lately me and my girl have been visiting the heidelburg location. i love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \u000a\u000aservice is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. seek out this lady.  my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\u000a\u000aim in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the fox chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  any girl i meet has to enjoy kings or she's out.

Vi arrived around 10 am on a saturday morning.  i was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and i informed her that i was alone.  she had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  after receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  it had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  so, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\u000a\u000athe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  she was extremely friendly.  i ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while i looked over the menu.  she returned, and took my order.  i ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast special - three slices of french toast made with pittsburgh's own jenny lee® cinnamon swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (i chose sausage), and your choice of potato (i went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  i also added an orange juice.  she went and put my order in, while i waited, and came back with it after not too long.   the eggs were cooked exactly how i wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  i also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.\u000a\u000akings family restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  i am pleased and will definitely come back again.

Von my recent road trip from dallas to new haven, ct, randy s. and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms. this, i must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, "there's nothing *in* pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" \u000a\u000atazza d'oro is the answer to that question. especially if you like coffee. this is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the mississippi, and i've been to a lot of them. so, what's so good about it?\u000a\u000alet's go in order of importance:\u000a\u000acoffee - it is really, really good. they use batdorf and bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in olympia. believe me when i tell you that b&b is good. it's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good i always get a latte. why? this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. i got a latte. they have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one i got. it was fantastic. they did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. \u000a\u000athe coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) i had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. it was always superior. \u000a\u000athis is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. \u000a\u000apastries - they all looked amazing. i had a plain donut while i waited in line. normally i don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.\u000a\u000aatmosphere - this place has it exactly right. it's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. very friendly employees. just a complete home run. \u000a\u000aobviously i loved it. behind me in line for my re-up, i heard a girl behind me in line complain, "we could just go to starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. that's fine. everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, i don't blame people for being set that way. but the beautiful thing about tazza d'oro (cup of gold in italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloween.\u000a\u000atazza d'oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to pittsburgh.

Vthis place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. it offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. still ha that neighborhood feel though. i have never had food there though they offer paninis. great desserts. good espressos and okay coffee.outdoor seating. good place to study. plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless.

Vthis is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. it took me far too long to come around and love tazza d'oro. a horrible ex of mine loved this place and i admit that this soured me. i regret the time i wasted not going here. the dark wood inside comforts me. the small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \u000a\u000atazza d'oro brews batdorf and bronson beans (amazing), provides enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs i've ever met (amazing). everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \u000a\u000athey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but i have never actually eaten it. the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia, wa. i talked about this with one of the barristas at td'o and they were offended - "we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different." sorry, tazza d'oro, you are better. \u000a\u000athe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. there's a sense of community nestled here, just off the "main drag" of highland park, between bryant st. and the reservoir. this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. the percentage of students is low. like the rest of pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally i see people i like and miss, which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me.

Vdo you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  i am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  i am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  it is 11:30 on a monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.\u000a\u000ait is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.\u000a\u000aenrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.\u000a\u000aother reasons to love this place (i know some of the other reviews highlighted these but i thought they were worth repeating).\u000a\u000a- free wifi\u000a- outside tables\u000a- tasty treats\u000a- they have a blog!\u000a- really great coffee\u000a- the staff are coffee experts

Vtazza d'oro has a generally european decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. the espresso is, bar none, the best i've had - including my admittedly limited travels in italy. it's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\u000a\u000athe coffee is also terrific, and tazza d'oro uses batdorf & bronson beans - the best i've ever had for home grinding. they have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\u000a\u000ain addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; i'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends i've tried were all memorably flavorful.\u000a\u000aall that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. no one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.

Vbest independent coffeeshop i've ever had the pleasure to visit.\u000a\u000abest americano i've ever had.  some of the best espresso i've ever had.  great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  good food.  the employees are awesome.\u000a\u000athe owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  the shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.

Vthis is some of the best coffee i've ever had. i've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (i've run into a cash-only, lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop, which are useless to me.)\u000a\u000athe pastry i had was good, though a bit overpriced at ~$3. the mocha i had was absolutely amazing, though their largest size is only 16 oz, which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce.

Vthe coffee here was excellent! had a double espresso. apparently their roaster is in santa cruz ca. large selection of french press coffees. baked goods did not look too great but that is not why i came here. atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. also has wifi which works! nice to find a place like this when traveling. is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.

Vthey just opened a spot at carnegie mellon, on campus in the gates building and it has changed my life. my closest coffee option before was seattle's best, so you can imagine how delighted i was when this opened next door to where i have class all day.  the first week they were open i think i went there about 4 times.  the italian cappuccino will wire you for a few hours, but is totally amazing.  their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though, so stick with espresso drinks. i have also had two delicious paninis, which i highly recommend.  knowledgeable service. great drinks! yum!

Vthe coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.  it was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table.  all of us felt like the panini/burritos were totally edible and good just not great.  the flavors just weren't super tasty.  i would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for food.\u000a\u000ait kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in pittsburgh.  i mean, it definitely does not deserve that ranking.  i wouldn't want out-of-towners coming to pittsburgh and thinking that's the best we have.

Vcoffee, coffee, espresso, cappuccino, coffee, espresso...tea!!!  amazing selection of teas; high-quality, loose and those that i've tried have been so delicately balanced, the word perfect comes to mind. \u000a\u000awhile their espresso is also excellent, i've not been pleased by tazza d'oro's (soy) lattes, so i am going to indulge my renewed enthusiasm for fine teas and work my way through their extensive menu that which is not to be overlooked if you have even the slightest interest in exploring beyond the weak frontiers of lipton.

Vthought it's somewhat pointless to write a review for this place. i mean, every spro geeks i know of in town knows this is the best place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink. the only reason i still decided to write this review is stupid yelp doesn't let me add a store to my list unless i have written a review for it. dah!\u000a\u000athis place is where all my fine coffee addiction started with. never did i have a cup of starbucks coffee after my first visit to tazza d'ro. not sure if it is a good thing, since now i have to do a lot of research on where to get a good cup of coffee before going to a new city no matter for business or for pleasure.\u000a\u000ai love their signature "bike love" for all the espresso drink w/ milk. it's fruity, mild, and fragrant. it's addictive! the only thing i have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it, although it tastes super innocent. it's actually almost stronger then any spro blend i've tried.\u000a\u000ai also appreciate a lot  the community atmosphere and the effort to bring in community improvement of td.\u000a\u000anot a good place to study/work at on a weekend afternoon tho. it's too popular thus noisy.

Vsome of the best coffee in pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). really warm, rich blends, especially the espresso. the tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety, so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers, too. it has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). i've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. it's a good place to linger and savor. its proximity to the park is a big advantage.

Vthe epitome of 4 stars: excellent without being perfect. tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. turning around is worth it.\u000a\u000ayes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  the patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  \u000a\u000athe noise level is perfect.  most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  you don't need headphones to concentrate here.\u000a\u000adecor is decent without being great.  the ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  so is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.\u000a\u000aiced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. we tried their richly brewed ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  the medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.\u000a\u000athe food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.\u000a\u000aa solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.

Vjust realized that no one mentioned about their chai latte yet. they make their chai from scratch. the best chai i have ever had outside of my indian co-worker's kitchen. the only thing is, since they premade a whole pot, there's no way you can get a cup of skim chai...

Vthe coffee here is amazing (i love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). the baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. while there are a number of tables, enrico's was busy even on a friday night...i would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours.

Vone of the best espresso bars i've been to.\u000a\u000a+1 for great espresso.  i had a shot of ethiopian espresso.  fantastic!  grabbed a costa rican pour-over on my way out ... perhaps one of the best cups of coffee i've ever had.\u000a\u000a+1 for baristas who pay great attention to detail\u000a\u000a+1 for great atmosphere.  the ceiling is tastefully ornate, and the decor is pleasing.  hearty wood furniture used throughout.\u000a\u000a+0 for having a location a bit far from downtown.\u000a\u000aa favorite for locals and not-so-locals alike.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended!  i will return...

Vthe environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor. a great place to enjoy a beverage, book, and music.\u000a\u000ai had an italian cappuccino. it was well balanced and i enjoyed every sip. on my way out i had a costa rican pour over that took me by surprise. it was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. it rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. as the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.\u000a\u000ai highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink. i will be returning.

Vi've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and i'm sorry, but i don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  i'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. yes, the coffee is good and if i happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, i'm sure i'd stop in to get it again.  but the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere i can't overlook or sit in.  i think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.

Vi tell everyone about this highland park gem my friend introduced me to. people who come here appreciate expertly steamed milk and delicious breakfast/lunch options. in this quaint shop gone are the days of the mass-produced lattes and microwaved sandwiches. every time i visit pittsburgh, i make sure this place is in my schedule somewhere. love it.

Vpittsburgh's definitely got nothing on seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. tazza d'oro is one of them. i wont say the best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care tazza d'oro subscribes to. it brings them millions of miles above starbucks and (gasp) crazy mocha.\u000a\u000ai found out about tazza d'oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. he conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the us via google maps. i clicked on pa and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for tazza d'oro.\u000a\u000atheir baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. they also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- enrico's in the strip district; what more could you ask for?\u000a\u000ai have a longer article on tazza d'oro as well as another great coffee shop, espresso a mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/

Vi can remember the time when i used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. don't we all miss those days of being so naive? \u000a\u000aadmittedly, i never finish any coffee that i drink, not only because i'm apparently wasteful now that i think about it, but also because i'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. make no mistakes, i will finish any coffee drink from tazza d'oro and at record speed. it is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear i have nothing bad to say about this establishment.\u000a\u000asome of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. the prices are reasonable and the location is great, tucked away in highland park.

Vi'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but i'm not going to go out of my way for it.  \u000a\u000aenrico's tazza d'oro cafe is definitely very good--i love the location in highland park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  we even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  \u000a\u000amy girlfriend and i ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin i would say the ones they had looked good.  i do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  it's tough to make the "i'm a fan" list for coffee houses.  i'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  \u000a\u000awhile i"m on the note of highland park, i want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in highland park.  accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such i'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  at this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.\u000a\u000ait's never too late.

Vthe espresso is definitely good. although the interior is strange, the location is cute for highland park. \u000a\u000amy beef is with the snarky pittsburgh hipster employee's that barely even engaged with my jokes made about their beta fish "vivian." seriously, a boy beta, named vivian! that fish needs some recognition and love. after basically flirting with ourselves, it seemed like all they cared about was acting cool and barely providing an engaging espresso experience for me and my friend who were obviously excited to be there! \u000a\u000anext time, maybe there will be different employee's. but i have a feeling their lack of enthusiasm for serving the general public will deter me elsewhere. sad times tazza, i felt like i could have really loved you.

Vas if in answer to my prayer.\u000a\u000ai'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. i had rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. \u000a\u000ai'm basing this on the fact that i love this style of coffee shop (could be in seattle or portland). and the fact that since coming to p'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people i've been around. well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the south side last night were not grumpy. maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at tozza doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. \u000a\u000athey don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.\u000a\u000athere is not as much in this neighborhood as i thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill.

Vi think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best i've ever had, in fact, i never even cared for them until trying tazza d'oro's. i still hold their teas in high regard. however, the food here sucks. they've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. i am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. even though enrico's is an easy walk from my home, i find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. i guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but i don't think it's that hard to do both; i mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. with a new lunch joint in the 'hood (park bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?

Voutstanding lattes. period. \u000a\u000athe service can be *very* slow, but the latte is worth the wait. and, the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers, but they make darn good lattes so who cares.\u000a\u000atucked in the beautiful highland park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful bryant street restaurants, tazza d'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. a nice short walk from highland park is a welcome plus. get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. that is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. \u000a\u000athey also have food, but i cannot speak for that. the interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character.

Vmaybe tazza d'oro doesn't need another review, but i guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.  \u000a\u000athe coffee selection is terrific.  the baristas are professional and courteous.  no, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  i'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  and that's what you get.  \u000a\u000athe pastries and snacks are fine.  good variety.  \u000a\u000athe atmosphere is just what i want when i need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  \u000a\u000awhen it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (i live in highland park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at "others" who stopped by.   they've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  the clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.  \u000a\u000ait's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at park bruges or smiling banana leaf, too!

Vthis place was pretty cool.  i mean defiantly felt like a place with a bunch of regulars, but i felt welcome inside.  \u000a\u000aall i got was a cup of coffee and a apple pastry.  my mother got a espresso.  both drinks were good, but for being one of the top rated places on yelp, i expected more than what i expirenced. \u000a\u000athe apple pastry did not seem very fresh, but it was still very good and worth eating.  \u000a\u000ai guess i was just a little disappointed because i expected so much more than what i got.

Vfinally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. the espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.\u000a\u000athe crowd at enrico's is varied, which i really enjoy. my 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew.\u000a\u000ano frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness.

Vwhat a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting!  i sat amongst the gathered hipsters, moms, friends, ladies who lunch, power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious indian spice black tea.\u000a\u000aservice was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  \u000a\u000ai was surprised when i asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  still looked like a good amount to me and i was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  i also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of twinings.  \u000a\u000afree internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.  now if someone could just find me an affordable house in highland park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop!

Vstill one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. what's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where i would go to sample new varieties of tea. sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by u.s. foods, or the like; nothing is local. it'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.

Vwonderful! lovely! quaint! one of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh! my visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much i appreciate fine espresso. i was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. the baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. i ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (i believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. my boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a european cafe to the states, then i don't know what is!

Vit was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but i was swayed by the yelp reviews!  you did not steer me wrong. \u000a\u000aa nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  my wife and i both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.\u000a\u000ait looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  we got the next to last free table.  almost every "two-top" had only one person sitting at it.  i would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. \u000a\u000arecommend!\u000a\u000ap.s. i thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here.

Vi really was missing voluto before its new ownership / management took over, on penn ave.  i needed a new place to try with friends who live in highland park for an excellent cup of fancy joe. i'm a steamed milk kind of gal.\u000a\u000astarbucks bless them when i am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix, but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals. lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups.\u000a\u000atake note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. i am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. the baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :) \u000a\u000aa decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.\u000a\u000ai also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. it has a neighborhood feel but i can tell people come from surrounding areas, tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough.

Vcute little spot in a sweet neighborhood. snag a table before ordering and you'll have a great experience. i stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich. the cappuccino was hot and satisfying (good quality beans, strong). and the vegetable panini adequate (i'm not the biggest fan of artichoke leaves).\u000a\u000agood spot for reading a book and eavesdropping on strangers' conversations.

Vi had always meant to visit enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.\u000a\u000aso here's what i liked: the cappuccino was perfect. it's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.\u000a\u000ahere's what i didn't like: sometimes i take my cappuccino plain, sometimes i take it with a shot of syrup. on this occassion i asked if i could get amaretto syrup, which they had. but the barista responded: "no, you can't." he said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if i liked sweet, he could make me something special, but i would have to trust his taste. here's the thing...i don't like sweet! i don't have much of a sweet tooth. i just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so i didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. i just got it plain.\u000a\u000ai'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a "real" cappuccino tasted like. please, i lived in italy, i've had a "real" cappuccino...but right now, i want a flavor shot in it. i still tipped because i wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. i just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not "allowed" to add them to your drink? \u000a\u000ait's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but i had to subtract a star for the attitude.

Vwhat a great find! i frequent the nearby bryant street restaurants, but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. i immediately fell in love it. the baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! there were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which i will need to go back soon to try. there was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. it would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.\u000a\u000ayou should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-)

Vbest coffee it pittsburgh? maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. french press, drip, espresso, or pour over? you name it they've got it. only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. if it is just coffee you want you this is the place. it is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in pittsburgh.

Vthis is a quiet little nook in highland park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. i used to frequent this place much more when i lived in pittsburgh, but i still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. it is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  the staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. the only change i could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. it'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!

Vi've heard a bunch of good things about this place, so i decided to make a trip over there on a sunday to check it out. while i enjoyed the coffee and cookies i bought, i have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and i did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. however, the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. every time i have been there since it has been really crowded and i've had trouble finding a seat. i would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables.

Vi just moved into a new place in highland park and realize this place was right next door. i'm a huge fan of coffee and have never been quite satisfied with the taste ever since my trip to italy(where there coffee is to die for). this place makes me happy with coffee again. i've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. this is my new place!

Vso i went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all i could think was "iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha" over and over again.  did i mention that i forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  i was a desperate woman at the end of that one.\u000a\u000aso i got home aired myself out and drove myself to enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  there was easy street parking right out front and i really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.\u000a\u000aso why the 3 stars?  well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  the syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  could have been a better mix.  would i give this another try?  sure but i definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.\u000a\u000athe coffee place at the walnut mall in shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  try the iced or blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping shady-style - awesome!

Vi love tazza d'oro! it is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\u000a\u000ait it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but i like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\u000a\u000ai usually get iced americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. all of the drinks i have ever had here have been tasty. i have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\u000a\u000ai'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. while i don't live in highland park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.

Vthe coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. the place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. there were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  i got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. it was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, i would not go back.

Vi adore this place! the light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and i love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! the coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (i'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) if a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, i'll be a fan for life. the only other pittsburgh place where i've found coffee this delicious was at commonplace coffee in squirrel hill. i went to college near chicago and come from california. i count intelligentsia and blue bottle coffee as some of my favorite places, so i mean it when i say the coffee here is wonderful. try it out, you won't be let down.

Von three separate visits, i've enjoyed three great cups of coffee. no complaints there. unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. on a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. the next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --\u000a\u000anow, before i go any further, i recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. i have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question "wet or dry" a thousand times. sometimes a "wet cap" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. and even when it's not, like most people, i don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what i was hoping for. i usually end up liking it anyways. my taste buds aren't that delicate.\u000a\u000aperhaps you can see where i'm going with this story. vanilla cappuccino. i get it, it's not something that's done. but when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. if you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. trust me, i've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. there's really never any need for snobbery. so i've got to dock tazza d'oro a bit. too bad, because the coffee is pretty good.

Vthe people who work here are very rude. i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. it is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. plus it is very dirty. perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. i will not go back again.

Vi walked in to this business and immediately knew i could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique, and i was absolutely correct. the espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. my accomplice's americano was equally well made, not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. i regret that i didn't notice the "manual" bar menu before i ordered, i've been dying to try a pour-over coffee, and i know it would have been delicious. \u000a\u000apro-tip: there is no sign for the unisex restroom, which is to the left of the service area, past the bulletin corkboard.

Vthe coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. if you're a local, i get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. \u000a\u000ai really wanted to like tazza d'oro. i've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. i drink espresso. i know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. i have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and i let you know you should probably try again. \u000a\u000athe last time i went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso i ordered. the gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. i tried it and it was very sour. i let the girl standing directly in front of me know that i didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment "ya well we just got it". silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you "just got" to taste good...\u000a\u000athis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. it's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. it's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off.

(and i love cheese pizza!)\u000a\u000abut some of my coworkers like to eat here on occasion, so maybe some of their other stuff is better. i wouldn't know.

Vi got pizza here on a saturday night in a pinch.  looking for a place that sells by the slice, i drove around for a while.  not only did they have by-the-slice pizza, but they also had some of my favorite toppings.  i also hate crust that's too thick, and -- although i prefer it even thinner than it was -- i was pretty satisfied with the crust.  \u000a\u000athe only thing that could be improved is the salad.  we got a grilled chicken salad.  the chicken and fries were okay, but the rest was pretty run of the mill.\u000a\u000aas for the pizza, i'll definitely be back for more.

Vi brought my husband and my parents all to papa j's last time my husband and i were in pittsburgh. my parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital i-talian.\u000a\u000amy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. the only reason i got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\u000a\u000awell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in murrysville. \u000a\u000athe first good sign dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after christmas. second good sign was that dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so i know he was anticipating a good meal. the kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \u000a\u000acan i say, i live in texas now and i still relive this afternoon back in december? i had chicken picatta...it was perfect. my dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. it all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. in austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\u000a\u000ai know there are so many good italian places in pittsburgh but i just think back so fondly on this day...when me dad liked someplace i took him :)

Vpapa j's is by far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh, my hometown.  i eat there almost every time i visit, and everything i've ever ordered has been fantastic.  fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  also, they make the best pizza in town hands down.

Vthis is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. my husband generally orders chicken parm, which is very good. their sauce is quite good. they serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.\u000a\u000a i generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and i get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. a tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (i want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (especially with some cracked black peeper.) i tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. \u000a\u000athe place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. it has a comfortable feeling. it also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. \u000a\u000aunfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!

Vthanks yelpers for this find. the service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. i had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. it was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter.

Vthis place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. papa j's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. i'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. i like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. but don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.

Vgreat, authentic, classic italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. \u000a\u000ai grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time i come to town.\u000a\u000atry the fried calamari "roman style" for a little kick!

Vi've been to papa j's twice and had mixed experiences.\u000a\u000aboth times i had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the fresh and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\u000a\u000afor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  i've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  my girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \u000a\u000athe service is also a mixed bag.  the first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even made me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  the second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \u000a\u000ai would return to papa j's, but i my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around carnegie/robinson.

Vi went there for dinner last night with a client.  this is second time i visited.  i had a scotch and he had a guiness.  the (-1) is for drink selection. just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.\u000a\u000awe started with the meatballs covered with provolone and other blessed goodness.  these did not disappoint.  i had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  it was fantastic.  they have so many good dishes, but i wanted the pizza last night.  i couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.\u000a\u000ai finished up with a coffee.  the parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in carnegie, pa.  i love the downtown there.

Vwhat a wonderful surprise found in carnegie pa, just south of pittsburgh.  i was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  they told us to try this little italian place called papa j's and boy did they send us to a great place.\u000a\u000afirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  you can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\u000a\u000ai am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \u000a\u000athe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  the three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  they obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and i don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  then came bowls of italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  of everything there, this was the one item i probably could have done without.  not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \u000a\u000awe also ordered the garlic rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  one of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  as if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \u000a\u000aby the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  i had the veal parmigiano which was tender and very good.  it came with a side of pasta which i tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  had i not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, i certainly would have finished it.  as it was, i ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \u000a\u000aone of my co-workers had the chicken picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \u000a\u000athey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\u000a\u000aoverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  i don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the chicagoland area, i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  the three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\u000a\u000amy only complaint is that i had to return to chicago and i am now craving to return to papa j's.  i hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!

Vyay, i'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  go to papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the white pizza.  it is the best white pizza i have ever had.  order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  it was delicious!  order fried calamari and it was ok...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\u000a\u000alike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \u000a\u000athe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.

Vterrible service.  food unremarkable.  waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  saved his tip by discounting meal after i complained.  all and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  not to be repeated, never again!

Vwe met our good friends from morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. \u000a\u000ai had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, i was jonesing for it. \u000a\u000ait certainly delivered. the crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. \u000a\u000aour friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. \u000a\u000awe'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in carnegie pa soon!

Vok, its friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. driving by papa j's and w says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \u000a\u000aadvice host that we are in a hurry.  the host advised us it is a 90 minute service. the place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. however our waiter, jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. we ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. in a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  yum!\u000a\u000ajust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. great job jason! the fettuccine carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  in and out in 60 minutes.  now that is some good service.

Vi have to say that i write this review with much regret, because i have always loved papa j's. but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \u000a\u000afrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. as i said before, i've been to papa j's a good handful of times so i know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions i had about a couple new dishes i was thinking about trying. i swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\u000a\u000abut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. it was one thing after another with our server. my wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  i mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? there was no one filling up water.\u000a\u000amy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. my dad and i both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. not what the special was at all.  and by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \u000a\u000abut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. when we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. at this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. the server then said he would have the meals re-made. so, he took the meals back to the kitchen. meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and i are sitting there with no meals. also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). all the kitchen did was scrape their "mistake" off of our fish! they didn't remake anything. our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. i honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from mcdonald's that night. the server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. i'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. the guy never really even apologized for the mistake. normally, i may have asked for a manager, but at this point i was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\u000a\u000amy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants i would rather eat at.

Vthis is a regular go-to for me. i love the food and the service. they always have the wine that i like and the food is always delicious. i suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). it is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness.

Vi thought the interiors were very nice.  we stopped here on a friday night & i was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  \u000a\u000amy daughter & i split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  it was pretty good- little messy.\u000a\u000athe desserts looked amazing.  i thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  the kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.\u000a\u000ai would return.

Vsan francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. i am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. i liked carnegie because u can stroll down main street and hit a couple places for lunch. i imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice.

Vcoming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  the tables, the decorations, the menu.  all the same.  does that make you a little worried?  yes.\u000a\u000ai ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  very very oily.  the actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  did i mention that?  \u000a\u000aambiance, like i said, left much to be desired.  i don't think i'd have this place on my list of "musts" for downtown.  much better restaurants to visit!

Vhad dinner at papa j's with a group of 6.  i loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. it felt like a neighborhood restaurant. on a saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  we were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  it was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  while she tried, i can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\u000a\u000apeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  the bread was delicious!  can you describe it to be creamy?  the fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  it was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\u000a\u000awe ordered a variety of dishes.  the pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  the shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  i had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  the marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\u000a\u000ahard to tell if the deserts were "homemade."  the tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \u000a\u000aon the whole, i was on the fence with my overall impression of papa j's.  "a-ok" probably is the best way to describe it.

Vservice in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are "just" working . they have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . nothing is served on the side with main dishes ....

Vgreat place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.\u000a\u000apapa j's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. my husband and i have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. i assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. i have been proved wrong.  we are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. i really don't understand why more people don't go here. \u000amy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.the zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. the wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. my husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \u000a\u000aalso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider papa js. they have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. we had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food.

Valthough the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a darth vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) the waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! outrageous !\u000athere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. i will most likely not return. very overpriced for the quality and service.

Vvery good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  we had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. the waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. best steamed broccoli iv'e ever had.

Vi was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  came here with no expectations.  \u000a\u000ai was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  it had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\u000a\u000aordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  quite good!!!  great balance of cheeses.  not too rich at all.  crust was excellent too.  can't wait to come back.

Vjust to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  we were celebrating 2 birthdays.\u000a\u000awe loved the food, it was delicious. my husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and i got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all loved it! it was stunning.  it was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)\u000a\u000athe one waitress we had jasmine, was fantastic!  she was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  she took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... \u000a\u000anow... the other waitress.. mary something was so incompetent...  she was awful and rude.  she missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' ugh.  then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  she came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  we were mad!!\u000a\u000athe place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  they look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   \u000a\u000aso good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. prices are about middle of the road for an authentic italian place, nothing crazy.  all in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want jasmine!

Vi am amazed that people can write negative reviews about papa j's.   i have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality, and service, are way above average......and especially for this price range.\u000a\u000akudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   nothing we had tonight was disappointing, and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.\u000a\u000athe best item tonight was the mozzarella appetizer "cradled" in bread with an authentic marinara.\u000a\u000athe white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was, as usual, out of this world good.   the scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.\u000a\u000awe will be back.

Vabsolutely awful service.  went to papa j's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  decided to try it again since it is close to stage 62.  big mistake.  greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  at one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  he said 'what do you want me to do about it?" and said they had a busy night.  this is when tables around us sat empty. i then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  the bill was prepared incorrectly. if you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  we will never go back.

Vi have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. i won't go back. the first time we were there almost 3 hours. it took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. when i complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. it made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? after arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. ridiculous. if it were up to me i would have never returned. unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. again it took a long time to get our food. my food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. my husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. the wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! my drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when i asked. bad food, slow service and rude managers. i'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. not worth it at all with all the other good italian options around.

V2nd times a charm. this place was 3.5 starts the first time i came, but stepped up large tonight.  waitress was righteous and very fun.  food was all excellent.  caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  can't wait for the leftovers!!  the white pizza is that star though.  the crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  i don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  ill be back.

Vservice was great. apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. i think i chose the wrong entree though because i ordered a cod with crabmeat special. the cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. it all reminded me of boiled fish. yuck! note to self. order the pasta!

Vit was just what we were looking for. the service was great. my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. it was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. i had the stuffed eggplant. that was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. i would definitely go back. really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.

Vwe stopped at papa j's last friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. there were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  one member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. in the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. he then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. she said "yep" and then abruptly turned and walked away. at that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. when my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said "what do you want me to do"?\u000a\u000amy friend said "an apology would be a good start" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said "get out and don't come back" ???????? are you kidding????\u000a\u000amy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. he was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \u000a\u000athat being said, we left and went back to 131 east, where we had previously eaten. the service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\u000a\u000athere are new restaurants that have opened in carnegie as of late. papa j's is no longer the only game in town.  obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. appalling!!  do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of papa j's. they understand the concept of  customer service.

Vfinally, great tuscan-style italian food in pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is italian.\u000a\u000athe bread was warm and fresh. the bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. i love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\u000a\u000ai'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, i'm saving room for dessert! the display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.

Vman has this place gone down hill.  my husband and i went a couple of weeks ago.  we had salads and pasta.  both were on the verge of inedible.  with a single glass of wine, i felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  seriously, i could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. classico is better.  and the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  seriously, i'd rather eat at the og.

Vfood was not good at all! my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. i ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. the salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with way to much vinegar dressing. my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. my pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. my husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. we ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. we took it home & it was so bad i didn't even eat my leftovers. and i hate wasting food!! plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. don't waste your time eating here. there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh.

Vtalk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. the latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. the pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. the desserts are pretty good. but honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated.

Vwhat, you haven't been to bellisario's yet? this is about the only red sauce pizza i ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. the crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. the dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. the sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. there's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. if you can go while mama's working, all the better.\u000a\u000ayou can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. you can't beat that. and i'd put bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.\u000a\u000ai grew up a five minute walk away. my mom loved bellisario's and i have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. every time i have a slice, it brings back great memories. but i've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as i think it is.\u000a\u000ait's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. if you're in west mifflin (say, going to kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. they've also got hoagies and calzones, and i think that's about it. but with pizza this good, who cares?

Vokay so i just moved to the outskirts of duquesne, pa which is outside of pittsburgh from harrisburg, pa of all places. where i am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. they were nice and cordial and cheap but i have been spoiled by the pizza shop in harrisburg, downtown, run my an old world italian guy named luigi. that pizza is/was miles better than this. this crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. the slices were small for their 8 slice which i did like. the cheese was good. the sauce was meh. i've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering.

Vpizza is very hit or miss. when the owners are there, it's really good. when they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and long delivery times. the pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. way more than other places around. usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. also they do not take credit or debit cards. there are better options.

Veat at your own risk. the service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of fast in their fast food. when we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. the only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like mcdonald's should. \u000a\u000athen again, the franchise is owned by rice, and i've come to take terrible service is their mo.

Vmy expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high. but for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\u000athe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. i had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person behind me. i waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. after watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, i asked where mine was. the manager started yelling at the cashiers for "serving off their orders" when they didn't have their food. but neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\u000athe manager was rude when giving me my order. she didn't make sure that i had everything on my receipt, and never even had the decency to apologize that i felt i was getting poor service.\u000ai've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over 30 years. i've worked at more than one location. i expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. but i have yet to have a decent experience at this store. it will remain a place i avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. perhaps i should go back to the racially biased service of steak n shake instead!

Vi've tried to give this mcdonalds a chance but my patience has run out. the only reason why i came here as much as i did is because i like the $1 iced coffees. but it's not even worth it. this mcdonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \u000a\u000awhenever i want to go through the drive-thru i can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. and even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. so most of the time i just park and go inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000atoday was a horrible day. i ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. it only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. i waited 10 minutes!! sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! it's not like i ordered a meal! during that time i saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! wth?! i told the petite sleepy eyed cashier i wanted my money back! her eyes opened wide in surprise, like i really woke her up or something. she said,"youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? i can get it for you!" for real? she was the one who took my order! i told her i waited too long and i just want my money back. the manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  i refused because i had just had enough.\u000a\u000athere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. there is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. it looks like none of them want to be there. i used to work in fast food and i know it sucks, but come on!\u000a\u000ai'm sorry but i can't recommend this mcdonalds. it's poo. i'm not coming back here anymore. guess i'll be going to starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!

Vso i moved to pittsburgh from los angeles. i know i know i know!\u000aanyway so theres absolutely no places in homestead that delivered chinese so i decided to walk down to the closest chinese food/restaurant to my house. \u000a\u000athe family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. i read a review about them on google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. don't believe it!\u000a\u000aon this visit i ordered the steamed dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...that liar) and the vegetable chow fun. i generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and i'll force myself to eat them when i have the munchies/starving to death. the vegetable chow fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by. \u000a\u000abut all in all the verdict is you typical chinese take out place.\u000a\u000a*puts the menu on the fridge*

Vnot bad for neighborhood corner chinese food. the szechwan is not good. too much...ketchup?? the wonton soup is good.  very good curry chicken with onion and happy family. \u000aegg rolls are hit or miss. sometimes they can be a little underdone. \u000ais this the best place? no...but it does the trick especially for a hangover cure.

Vwhenever i was at the waterfront i would eat here.  the shakes are good, as are the shoestring fries and baked beans.  the sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double.  overall, pretty tasty.

Vthe food is good and its cheap.\u000a\u000ai mean really inexpensive.\u000a\u000a$4.00 for a burger and fries. add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  seldom if ever crowded. \u000a\u000aservice can be a tad slow but hit or miss.\u000a\u000athey also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.\u000a\u000atry the shakes, they're great.

Vthis is the absolute worst steak n shake i've ever been to. \u000a\u000athe bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. it was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, steak n shake is basically a glorified mcd's), our waiter comped our whole meal.\u000a\u000aif not for the compensation, i would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. the bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our steak n shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\u000a\u000ai think i'm good with my steak n shake craving for a long time now...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aps. the whole joint smells like major b.o.

Vi went here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. i ordered the chili mac supreme to go. i thought i would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\u000a\u000along story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after i had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so i told her to cancel it and walked out. now i see that others on yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. wish i had looked it up earlier.

Vi heart steak n shake. i love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.\u000a\u000ai visited steak and shake on new year's eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. i was unnaturally attracted to their wisconsin buttery burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. sounds good right?\u000a\u000awell, i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. the pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  i took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and i literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things i had eaten in a long time.\u000a\u000athis is not meant to be a fine dining experience. service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. it just kind of was. however, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take x amount of time to all patrons. so i give them a pass for being upfront about it.\u000a\u000anext trip to pgh is going to feature steak and shake - i guarantee it.

Vwell... as steak 'n shake locations go, this isn't the best one around--but it is burgers and fries that are open 24-7.\u000a\u000athe milkshakes are good!\u000a\u000apros: \u000aalways made fresh, when you order;\u000a\u000acons:\u000agreasy (but its burgers);\u000atakes longer than typical in drive thru (but that's bc they're made fresh!);\u000aservice (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being awesome) is a 4.

Vin general i do like shake n' steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  you never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  a friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there ever!  you can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. however, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  the burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\u000a\u000aby far my worst visit to steak n' shake!

Vrather typical sns.  had a good lunch crowd.  milkshake was good but not as good as enp down the street.  it took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, i realized cooked to order but this is a little long for sns.  ordered the guacamole steakburger and it only had a small portion of gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  oh well!

Vah, steak n shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. you're faster (and cheaper!) than eat n park. plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. granted, if we were at a fancy party, i might act like i don't know you, but deep down inside you know i heart you.

Vterrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, i observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. i think one server was high. \u000a  \u000a  going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging.

Vi really like the chili. burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. pretty hard to mess up a side salad. as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. the staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. all in all what you pay is what you get. cheap and crap service.

Vfast food done right, what more can you want?\u000a\u000aa throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. \u000a\u000amy sisters and i arrived on a tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. this meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! \u000a\u000ai ordered the western bbq burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, and fried onions. it came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. are you kidding me? what's not to like! the food was actually pretty good! i liked it a lot. since it was happy hour i also "splurged" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. it was meh. could have gone without it. the overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. but, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?\u000a\u000aall in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. a steal. also the food is good! i enjoyed it. i'd come back.

Vthe food is good. unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. the main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.

Vfood is good, what you'd expect from steak n shake. the service is awful. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. i've been going here for years when i want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. go to mcdonalds.

Vthe service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. i had a bus to catch so i couldn't wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay. she never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \u000a\u000athe burger was really greasy, the fries were luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. as a new pittsburgher i'm not impressed.

Vi should have known better than to stop here, but i was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  i should kick myself for thinking of this place.\u000a\u000agranted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  the sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i hadn't paid already.  \u000a\u000awhile sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  what disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  what disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  i mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  after witnessing this my food was finally ready and i drove away.\u000a\u000awhen i finally got to eating my food i was underwhelmed.  the fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  the "steakburger" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the bbq sauce on it.  it was all i could taste.\u000a\u000aall this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.

Vburgers are not the best quality. better than mcdonald's but not much better. the fries are fairly thin, but crispy. they aren't bad. the prices are also quite decent. however, their shakes are amazing. thick and creamy. it's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am.

Vyou know what you're getting with a steak n shake: it's about one rung up from a mcd's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. at least, you think you know. \u000a\u000ai used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for steak n shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? but after my last trip, i can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. i haven't been back in over year, and i will never step foot into a steak n shake as long as i have an immune system that i care about. \u000a\u000aafter having eaten here, i hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). one stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? after a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. yes, that's right...."you want fries with that? *flush* okay, that will be $5.50". i have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. to top it off, after finishing her "bathroom break", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. i guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. and i was in too much of a rush to choke back up what i had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.

Vi love steak n shake. this one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. the food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. most of the time, they're downright rude. i highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. there's one on route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.

Vi never thought that i'd be giving steak 'n shake a 4 star review, but i really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. it just hit the spot!\u000a\u000ai was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. he apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. however, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.\u000a\u000ai ordered a grilled cheese and fries. the grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. i love steak 'n shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as i had expected.\u000a\u000afor just $9 for me and my husband, i have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive steak 'n shake was. based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon.

Vthis place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  i've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \u000a\u000ait's the rare place i can get a frisco melt well, the only place i can get a frisco melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, walk in or drive thru.\u000a\u000ajust take a gun on weekends, you'll be fine.

Vthis location is terrible. the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. i waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. then the lady proceeded to ask me if i would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) i asked "doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?" she then told me it only comes with cheese. so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger. pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when i open my burger its just meat and cheese. the meat is badly burned and cold. it was clear to me this burger was not fresh. i didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. they definitely need better workers.

Vsteak 'n shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. i ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. the salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (they forgot the cheese!) the staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. there usually is a long wait at steak 'n shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. i do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.

Vnice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\u000a\u000ai do like this place.  it must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  like smoking, sitting and texting.  i'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the "to do" list because there is no where else togo really....\u000a\u000awhy didn't they answer me at the drive through? i think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and i are really really really good looking.\u000a\u000athis was annoying but understandable.

Vi ordered 2 pizza's from here today to take to some friends who are volunteering for the election.  everything was ready in less than 30 mins.  the pizza was good - nothing fancy - not too greasy, sauce was good.  i should have ordered the large instead of the medium. i would definitely order from here again.

Vworst pizza i've had in pittsburgh. i ordered from here last weekend. the pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. the buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily i had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \u000a\u000amaybe it was one bad night, and i can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, i can't recommend this place to anyone.

Vahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 pm, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. i got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. the pizza was decent. there was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. i felt sick before i got halfway through it. that reminds me - the slices are huge, and are $2. the onion rings were extremely basic - i gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\u000aone irritating thing i overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like "we don't have those anymore" or "no, we can't cook wings dry." sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.

Vi had some pizza from pizza parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  a colleague brought it in, so i didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  i had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  it was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  i was starving so i really enjoyed it, but i think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, i'd say go for it.  just don't have very high expectations.

Vpizza parma has many of the characteristics i like in a pizza joint. \u000a1) they deliver when they say they will, \u000a2) diverse menu and toppings, \u000a3) coupons, \u000a4) online ordering, and \u000a5) take credit cards. \u000a\u000ai think pizza parma shines with their specialty pizzas. artichoke, buffalo chicken, spinach & feta, and greek pies are all delicious. i've also had some of their pasta dishes, and i can't complain. it's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. pizza parma fails on wings, though. the texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. desserts are also not worth the buy.

Vi've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  i also should have known that i shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\u000a\u000ai figured i'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  i opted for the popcorn chicken salad.  sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \u000a\u000ai have to say that even though i was saying yes, my body was saying, 'oh hell no!'\u000a\u000ai'm regretting this decision now as i am sitting here in discomfort.  not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  but i'm not liking the effect i'm getting right now.  could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\u000a\u000ai'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.

Vthree stars is super accurate for this place. we decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken bubba show (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. all together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. as for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. i prefer a more herby sauce myself, so i wasn't wowed by it. the fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. overall, if i were in a pinch i'd order from here no problem but it's not a place i'd set out to order from because i love it.

Vpizza parma delivers through grubhub, which is the primary reason i ordered sandwiches from them. bbq chicken was ok. the bread is a little more on the burnt than toasted side, leading it to be dry. the value is good. the 20" sandwich was about $11.

Vif you find yourself craving pizza on a saturday night, you can't beat $9 for a large cheese pizza. i also enjoy the hoagies as they are lightly toasted for a nice crunch.\u000a\u000ai can't speak for the pastas or appetizers, but the pittsburgh style grilled chicken salad is a dependable choice.

Vi have to say, i maybe (/definitely) had these guys programmed into my phone when i lived over in shadyside. i term this branch "good ole faithful," as they have come to my aid during many times of need, which possibly includes saturday nights at 2am (sorry for having to deal with me, guys). the pizza is freakin cheap and pretty damn good, especially for the price. i maybe (/definitely) use to call them every monday when they had an extra-large one-topping pizza and an order of bread sticks for only 9.99...... 9.99! i'm not sure that they still run this deal, but i could generally get a large cheese for about 10 bucks, and you can't really beat that. not too greasy, just enough but not too much cheese, their pizza (and actually other food items, which is surprisingly quite extensive) is better than average and tasty for a night in alone or stumbling in with friends after a night out. i usually just walked over, where's it's perfectly nestled in the shopping center across from mad mex and buffalo blues on s. highland- however, they deliver too- and both options are surprisingly quick. enjoy!

Vwhen my boyfriend and i were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through eat24. i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. when i unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, i found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. i couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. to say the least, i was disappointed in my soup. when my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. we thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. it was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. he tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\u000athis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. i heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise i've heard about this place.

Vsome friends and i ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  we'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  my friend suggested getting pizza from here, and i didn't object, since i'd never had pizza from here before, and i'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.\u000a\u000athe pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  as for the pizza itself, it was solidly a-ok--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  it was a bit on the greasy side, and i could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  as for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  it was more greasy than i'd like, but not to the point where i felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though i was tempted to do so).\u000a\u000aas the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). it was better than vocelli's, and about on par with papa john's.  i wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but i wouldn't object to it, either.

Vi am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. i bear the friendly people of pizza parma no ill will.\u000a\u000abut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\u000a\u000awent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. they don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. fine. the smallest pizza, a "personal" pie, costs $7 and is 7" in diameter. the cashier and i agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since i'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, i get a "small," which is 10". i add a mushroom topping. i pay my $11.21 and wait.\u000a\u000athere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. so i waited outside the store on a bench.\u000a\u000athe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. i took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, "i hope this $11 pizza is pretty good." opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10" pizza is, and started eating.\u000a\u000alet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. i will eat it and think, "well this isn't the best pizza i've ever had but it's fine." that is not what i thought when i ate pizza parma's pizza. i thought, "it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. i'll just try to eat as much of this as i can."\u000a\u000ai ate three out of the six "slices." (one sixth of a 10" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. that sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) i couldn't stand to eat more than half. the mushrooms were fine; i fished them out and ate them. the cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. the crust was poofy and not crusty.\u000a\u000aashamedly, i threw half of a pizza away tonight. folks, i am not a food destroyer. i eat things i don't like, and expired foods, because i don't want to waste. it takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\u000a\u000awent home, made some eggs, and guess what? the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? it's still in my mouth. i'm not making this up.\u000a\u000ai know there's good pizza around here. ordered two back to back slices at spak brothers--delicious! tasty! reasonable price! but whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. sheesh.

Vwhen i lived in los angeles a year and a half ago, p f chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.\u000a\u000ahere in pittsburgh, it's the only chinese place i've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in la's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.\u000a\u000athe kung pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.\u000a\u000atheir fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name i have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce i don't quite like.  still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.\u000a\u000aportions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  the minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.\u000a\u000aif you live in la, forget p f chang's.  if you live in nyc, i'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  but here in pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.

Vi hate this place.\u000ait's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\u000aif you want good chinese in pittsburgh, try china palace (shadyside) or sesame inn (station square or north hills).  they're quieter, with very good food & service.

Vany place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  p.f. chang's has a dedicated gluten-free menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  they also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  i don't know many other restaurants that go this far.\u000a\u000aaside from the menu preference, i enjoy my overall experience every time.  their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a chinese take-out or buffet joints.  don't expect this to be at all like that.  it's not a buffet.  they don't sell "general tso's" (though chang's spicy chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  they do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  they also sell sake, i believe they have a few different types.  \u000a\u000athe prices can get a bit more expensive than your average chinese restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  portions are excellent and the taste is great.  i've yet to have one complaint and i have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.\u000a\u000athe only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  it's also very dark because of their lighting.  however, i think it sets the atmosphere.  it can be a romantic place or a casual place, i've been there for both.

Vredo!\u000a\u000ai went to pf chang's several years ago and was not pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \u000a\u000amy issue: i thought i was getting chinese food.  \u000a\u000amy resolution: try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented american food with names of those chinese dishes i actually like to eat.\u000a\u000aso we returned to pf chang's for lunch to try this american food in this caricature of a chinese restaurant.  there were very few people in the restaurant.  the two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  when our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\u000a\u000acoca cola\u000aiced tea\u000apan fried pork dumplings\u000asesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\u000achangs chicken with white rice\u000a\u000aour drinks and my soup came out immediately.  unfortunately i was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before i had a chance to say anything.  i could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could i get her to come back to my table.  i tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  i didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  i asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. i didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\u000a\u000amy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  the server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when i told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since i knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  i mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. i took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  it was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  i saw no reason to continue.  i moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  the skins were a bit thick and doughy.  the meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  the sauce tasted a little odd so i tried to remix and it was still off.  i tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  we finished our dumplings.\u000a\u000aour lunch entrees arrived.  i had ordered mine extra-spicy, but i guess it came pittsburgh hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  the meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  i tried some of chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  this was supposed to be their version of general tso's chicken.  now i have never had a general's chicken that was the same at any place.  it is always different.  many of them are good in different ways.  this food, though, it wasn't good.  chang's chicken fell into the same category as the sesame chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \u000a\u000ai just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  even the yoshida sauce you get at sam's/costco tastes better.

Vhonestly, i'm furious. i enjoyed pf chang's restaurants in the chicago area, and my wife and i have eaten a few times at this pittsburgh-area location. over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. we tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. the front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\u000a\u000atonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. we came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. they couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\u000a\u000ai imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\u000a\u000aafter 20 minutes we gave up. we went back to pf chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. i saw open tables.\u000a\u000awhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\u000a\u000athe food here is good, but certainly not great. we went to a local thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. the food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\u000a\u000awe certainly will never visit pf chang's again.

Vstars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\u000a\u000agot there at 8pm on saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(fyi-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  i had the singapore rice noodles.  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \u000a\u000athe service was annoying.   we were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished.  i found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \u000a\u000ai think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  the result never quite met the anticipation.

Vi am writing this from the standpoint of someone who can't eat real chinese food because of gluten issues. that said, i am loving me some gluten-free chinese food here! if the gf issue didn't exist, though, why bother when you can get real, honest, non-chain great chinese so many wonderful places in the burgh?!  but average chinese is better than no chinese if gluten is an issue so thank you mr. chang!

Vour go to place at the waterfront. \u000a\u000awe usually order the crispy green beans as an app., they are always fried just right and never really greasy. as an entree i always get coconut curry tofu, the veggies are bright and crisp (no open pea pods or limp broccoli!) and the tofu is simply delightful. \u000a\u000aalways consistent. never disappointing

Vwent there for lunch and had a decent meal.  while the mongolian beef was beyond excellent, the moo goo gai pan was average (although i did enjoy the shrimp in it).  service was fine and decor is pleasant.  for some reason i'm just not in the mood to write a detailed review - please accept my apologies.

Vsadly i've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. there's nothing really wrong with it. the portions are big and the food is "alright" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\u000a\u000athe food is sooooo bland though. everything you get at p.f. chang's you can get elsewhere in pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. the honey chicken at p.f. chang's was so mediocre all i could think about while eating it was heading over to wai wai in bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\u000a\u000alast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. i don't think i've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. he brought my girlfriend's father (don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. he then got all huffy when don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. when he came back to take our order don ordered for himself and his wife and before janey (my girlfriend) and i could order he had already started to walk away. we actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) after that he must have thought we were terrible diners (i don't think i've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or anyone for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\u000a\u000aobviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. but it's soooooo bland! go somewhere else for chinese! look up chinese on urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.

Vmy vegan friend, deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at pf chang's and stay on a vegan diet.\u000a\u000avegan friend deb (vfd) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. the waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.\u000awarning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. the vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.\u000a\u000athey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.\u000a\u000ai always loved the fact pf chang's offered brown rice. that nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.\u000a\u000athe service staff at chang's is always top shelf, i've never had a bad time here and love when we go.

Vwe visitied pf changs on sunday with a large group of 20 people.  although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!\u000a\u000awe enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!\u000a\u000aif you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  they come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.\u000a\u000aoverall, we had a great time and would come back here again.

Vi've had pf changs both in pgh and kc and honestly, i'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. it's 'upscale' ameri-chinese food. you don't come here seeking 'authentic' asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit american taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. do i even know what 'authentic' chinese food is? yes, sortuv, somewhat. will i stop putting quotes around 'everything'? definitely not!\u000a\u000ait was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.\u000a\u000athis particular pf changs, on the homestead waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. we sampled everything from the the szechuan shrimp to the mongolian beef to the dan dan noodles. good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.\u000a\u000ai don't come here all that often but when i do, i invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.

Vso i have never been to p.f. chang's before since i'm chinese and i'm not a huge fan of eating at chinese/american restaurants when i can eat delicious authentic chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). my boyfriend and i were at dave & busters and weren't in the mood for american food, which was what we were all surrounded by so i decided to give p.f. chang's a try. \u000a\u000awe came on a saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( luckily time went by fast while i was on my phone looking at the yelp reviews for this place. when we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. we got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the dan dan noodles and shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. the food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. the calamari was okay. i felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. the dan dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. i really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. the shrimp was cooked well and was also good. overall i was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if i'm ever in the mood for chinese/american food.

Vthe service was lackluster. coffee was warm but delicious. limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.\u000a\u000adaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. wife had spicy chicken. i had wonton soup. dumplings as an appetizer for the table. all arrived warm. the brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. also dry as sand. i guess that is how they serve it.\u000a\u000athe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. i had expected them to be more diverse. \u000a\u000ain all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. i'd rather have the local chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.

Vfirst time eating at pf chang- thought the food was fine but i'd rather go to an authentic chinese restaurant any day. it felt like a chinese version of the cheesecake factory.  \u000a\u000aanyway, it was a saturday, late afternoon, and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  i don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but i wasn't impressed with the service.\u000a\u000asome nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari, which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. the sesame chicken was also very good.  other things were fine, just not memorable.  \u000a\u000ai think this is an ok place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the waterfront and don't mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner. if you want to get in and out in a hurry, don't come here.

Vthis was my first time at this pf chang's and i was not impressed. the service was extremely slow even though it was a sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. the portions were small. \u000a\u000athey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. pop music?! come on--this is an "asian bistro."

Vi was unimpressed with my food and i am even more sad to see, now that p.f chang's mass produces frozen dinners. \u000athis is about as far away from chinese food you can get, unless of course you are eating microwaved warmed shrimp fried rice. the restaurant is cluttered and the music was up so loud.  i had to yell to carry on a conversation. p.f chang's in the waterfront is a unmemorable experience. maybe i would have better luck microwaving my own meal at home?

Vi really enjoyed my mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \u000athere was no presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \u000aone of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill non franchise is presentation and experience.  i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation. \u000a\u000areservations:\u000aour party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\u000a\u000aat 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\u000a\u000awhen we requested silverware for the table. our waitress blamed it on the hostess. yes, thehostess should have provided silverware.. however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. as a patron i could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\u000a\u000amy hot and sour soup is usally served with"noodley" things that i drop in the soup. we weren't given any "noodley " things . not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. this experience is what sets this restaurant apart.

Vi have mixed feelings about this place. i wish i could give 2.5 stars, but i'm in a good mood so i'm rounding up today. \u000a\u000athis was my first time here and i honestly wasn't sure what to expect. the first thing i noticed when i walked in was the layout of the dining area. it seemed less intimate than i had pictured in my mind. the tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. \u000a\u000awe were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. it seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. i appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were "meant to be shared." my wife and i decided to share our two meals: chang's spicy chicken and double pan fried noodles. before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a "here's your sauce" kind of way. i remember thinking, "that's very nice, but i have no idea why you just gave us sauce." there was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. we picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and i still didn't know what they were for. \u000a\u000aforget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. for meals that were "meant to be shared" these sure are little portions. i guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. the food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). i can't say it was the best i've had, but it was good enough. \u000a\u000aoverall i thought the experience was lacking. p.f. chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. i was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. the music didn't fit the ambiance. our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. the restaurant was loud and crowded. the girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  \u000a\u000ai think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.

Vsurprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   first time at this location.  great service, but wasn't hard to do.....\u000a\u000ahad a combination orange shrimp and chicken and chicken fried rice.  it was typical pf changs (very good).  you can get the fried rice off the kids menu for $2.95 versus $8 for a big bowl off the regular menu.

Vlet me start by saying that i do like their food. \u000a\u000alast night i went with my wife and two guests. the apps came out fast and were fantastic. dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. the rice was undercooked, and we told our server. he set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. by the time i was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\u000a(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\u000a\u000ai ordered the chocolate cake. i asked for a container to take half home. the server brought out a small container and when i asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. she then realized that a larger one would be better.\u000a\u000a4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.

Vi've always liked pf chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. i typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\u000a\u000athe food is typical pf chang's: delicious. as one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that i can go there and eat somewhat healthy (i'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). while some complain about the portion sizes being too small, i've always felt like they were perfect. i do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of "chinese" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. i've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.\u000a\u000ai've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that i've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. i was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. i'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. after sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., i finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. i had never experienced something like that, but i received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily i wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. the experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\u000a\u000athe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every pf chang's i've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. my wife and i would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. i love pf chang's, but i hate waiting more. if you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. i've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. pf chang's, included.

Vok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying...

Vour last few visits have left something to desire, one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. these people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\u000a\u000athe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (hint, hint) so we left and most likely will not be returning.

Vif you look at other reviews you will see that i am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  we sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  she spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. we ordered appetizers and they never came out.  she actually brought us our check and we never got our food. by the way we were the only people at the bar.  finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. we payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. we finally got seated by the windows. do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. we ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. after our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. nothing was comped and no manager was available. this pf changs needs new management!! we will never return. i will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. steer clear until changes are made. it's not worth the headache.

Va big thank you to chad cynamom, manager at pf chang's for making our anniversary night so special.  he seated us, brought us drinks and told us about the menu.  every time my fiance and i go to this pf chang's, we get the best service.  food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had, hence the 4 stars.  it is a bit overpriced as well, but the service makes up for it.

Vcame out here with my parents to have dinner.  i have to say that our meal was all around worth a 4 star rating, but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating.  \u000a\u000aour food was pretty good.  the lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part, and this time it was no different.  my mom's fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious.  however, my $19 mahi mahi was pretty much like eating air... there was seriously no taste at all, and it was tiny!  i found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring.\u000a\u000aif i was you, i would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal.  if you have room, lettuce wraps for dessert, too.  oh yeah, and to drink, lettuce wraps.

Vwalked in tonight, wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. when she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  didn't say a word to us. unbelievable!  will not be back there-- rude hostess!

Vthe service started out slow, but they eventually picked up the pace. we ordered the chicken/lettuce wrap appetizer, and we enjoyed it. for the entres, we had the fried rice and mongolian beef, both of which were delightful. i would not mind going back to explore their menu.

Vwe recently went here for a group dinner with friends.  i am unable to eat gluten and my server (denice) was knowledgable and brought me special sauces as not to irritate my allergies.  she was amazingly accommodating and when my meal was too spicy (which was totally my fault) she got me something else.  i had the gf beef with broccoli and it was amazing.  she was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  we were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  i've been to eateries before where that was treated with great disdain.  never once did i feel unwelcome.  i will go out of my way to eat here again.

Vi usually have fair experiences with this pf changs. i've been inside the restaurant, and have used the curbside to go service. i finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.\u000a\u000ai can't remember her name, but whomever worked curbside to go on oct 30, 2013 around 6:30pm deserves a mention. she was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. they're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! she also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good. \u000a\u000athe food here is always in point. i like to get the edamame, sesame chicken with brown rice, and the flour less chocolate dome! \u000a\u000ai'm reducing a star because of past experiences with service.

Vi've heard it's very much a chain and that it's not at all authentic chinese food, however despite all that i have to admit the food was good and the service was excellent.  there is quite a disconnect with the loud rock music played in the dining room and the serene chinese decor, but i figure it works for somebody!  i ordered the ginger chicken with broccoli and the meal was quite tasty.  the prices are quite reasonable.  just as long as you are not looking for authentic chinese dishes, this restaurant will definitely serve in a pinch.

Vi will say make a reservation since it's pretty busy on a weekend!  we got seated quickly with a reservation.  our server was excellent despite how busy it was.  he was also helpful with recommendations and let me sample a couple wines before picking a bottle.  the manager was also great.  we weren't in love with one of the dishes and the manager came out and talked to us about what we were looking for and gave us a complimentary order of what he recommended.  i will say this - they know how to treat their customers. we'll definitely be back :)

Vfirst, this is a big chain - not my favorite type of eatery.  for me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...\u000a\u000ahowever!  the chilean sea bass marinated in oolong tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+\u000a\u000anow - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.\u000a\u000ai've been to pfc vegas and pfc nyc - our homestead pfc definitely beats them both.  so many great little places to try in the 'burgh, but i wouldn't resist going back to this particular pfc.

Vonce you go pei wei, you never go.... pf chang's (if you can help it). \u000a\u000apei wei is chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the detroit market in 2007. subsequently, that was the last time i stepped into a pf changs until i recently moved back to pittsburgh. going from a pei wei to a pf chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a wnba game; it's so methodical and time consuming.\u000a\u000aon our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. by the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at pei wei.  add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. i get it, it's a me problem.\u000a\u000awith that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). \u000ai can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while i wait (something that's not an option at pei wei) (star).\u000aplymouth gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star).\u000ai found a dish i love not available at pei wei - salt and pepper prawns (star). \u000a\u000aso until i get sick of the prawns or a pei wei opens in the pittsburgh market, i'll continue to go to this location.

Vwe had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. there was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. as i expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. i appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. \u000a\u000ai still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy.

Vwent here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! lol. tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  by the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. love the way their mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn't so bad either.

Vwe went last night saturday night to p.f.chang located at the kierlands in scottsdale. terrible experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then i ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . after a long wait my food came so salty that i could not even eat and as much as i hate to complain but i had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. my husband's dish was ok. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. i feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. very bad experience. our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(

Vlet me start off by saying i have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for chinese has been the new dumpling house in squirrel hill. but since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, i was forced to try something new.\u000a\u000aso... i thought i'd try the chain pf chang's chinese restaurant at the waterfront. wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\u000a\u000ai started with a cup of their wonton soup. at $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than i was used to, including three giant basil (i think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. in the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two "pork"-filled wontons. as i said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! on a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\u000a\u000anext came my "lunch-portion" order of chang's kung pao chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \u000a\u000aat the new dumpling house, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which i was really hoping for... not at pf chang's. \u000a\u000aon my plate i received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice i have ever encountered. uncle ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\u000a\u000aglaringly, there was no sauce!. none at all.\u000a\u000ai've had kung pao chicken in new york city, san francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in bethel park, pa that was much, much better. never have i had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! the "lunch-portion" cost was $9.95.\u000a\u000aat the new dumpling house, i could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and i could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\u000a\u000athe service was decent. however, lesson learned. one and done. never going back to pf changs.

Vi'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... you know. \u000a\u000athe mains are basically a half notch classier than a chinese take out but i'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. \u000a\u000awhere i think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads, i know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad. the salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just a bowl of salty beef water.

Vstill good food but i find that more times than not when we go we have to ask for clean dishes or silverware. i have found this whether we are at the waterfront location or the robinson location. maybe they need a new contract with a new appliance company.

Vthis is the fourth changs i've eat ate. it was pretty good. the food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. had a strange texture. some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. overall still pretty good. would eat at this one again.

Vmy wife and i came here a few years ago and you couldn't get in the door because of the line. this was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. food came out quickly but was not as good as the chinese take out we get from sesame inn. spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. normally one of the great thing about getting chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. i don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on smithfield downtown.\u000athe one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. we just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. short of this, i'd probably give changs two stars. probably last time i'll stop in here unless i can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place i know won't be too busy.

Vour family loves this restaurant.  my children and i suffer from food allergies.   i have celiac's disease and their gluten free selection for a chinese restaurant is great.  my children are a completely different ball game.  they have a rare disease called eosinophilic esophagitus where food attacks their body.  they are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  this restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  the servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  our favorite manager is joe and favorite server is kevin.  call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions.

Vthis place hit the spot. \u000a\u000astopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. we got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \u000a\u000ai recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! who knew i liked green beans?! and this trip i tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)

Vmarges is tucked away in the delightful pittsburgh neighborhood of mckees rocks. this place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's, and half my grandmas kitchen.\u000a\u000athe seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.the prices are fantastic and so is the food.\u000a\u000ai had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. it was excellent. ladies and gents, i can put food away  like a champ and i still had leftovers.\u000a\u000amy friend had a succulent, buttery french toast. simple, but they nailed it.\u000a\u000ai would return.

Von a random sunday morning i went in search of a good breakfast spot.  i decided to explore the mckees rocks neighborhood and came upon marge's place.  i hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews i could find, i decided to give it a try.  \u000a\u000ainside, it's bigger than i expected but still has that down home diner feel.  my guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  the wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  i picked a table in the corner so i could observe what i imagine was a typical sunday morning.  i ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  any place that has mancini's italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  being in mckees rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  the potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  the only way i can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  is that even a word?  i just don't know how else to descibe it.  the combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  \u000a\u000aone random note: i liked the tables and chairs.  they were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  good distance between the table and chairs.  that may sound silly, and i thought so, too, at first.  but when i go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  \u000a\u000anot only will i return, but i will also recommend marge's place to anyone in the area.  it was a surprisingly good find.  i like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.

Vwe had the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. our waitress (annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. we ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \u000a\u000aone of my friends ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. but the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. when pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! how crude! \u000a\u000aspoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \u000a\u000awhen i asked the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! what a lame excuse! even your online menu says under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - "served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked kaiser roll." - that's what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich says. shame on you manager for lying! instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\u000a\u000anot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \u000a\u000ai am never going to come back to any eat n park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. what a waste of time and money! plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, i surely had my patience tested this evening!

Vthey burned my fish and they burned it bad.  ordering fish at eat'n park is always a gamble.  i just never know how it's going to turn out.  i'm a risk taker so i ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. \u000a\u000awell it went terribly wrong.  my waiter came out and said, "they burned your fish, so i had them put two new pieces in the oven."  i was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  \u000a\u000a i gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while i waited. \u000a\u000athen out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. with the burnt side down of course.  that just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  \u000a\u000alike i said getting fish from eatn' park is a toss up. in the end i got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so i left satisfied.

Vsome how even though the food at this eat'n park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  how can i stay mad when the prices or so cheep? myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\u000a\u000aon this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at eatn' park.\u000a\u000amy baked potato was hard as a rock, i had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \u000a\u000athe waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which i thought was sweet.

Vjimmy tsang's chinese restaurant is one of the old "traditional" pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always "being there."  my parents feel the same way about it.  it is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  \u000a\u000ai don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed i prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that i've always wanted to try--sau la gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  perhaps i've never noticed, but i don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  it was good, but hoo-boy did i have to pace myself while eating it.  and have plenty of water nearby!  sau la gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and i doubt i'll have it again.\u000a\u000amy friend maryann tried  ching za gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  i sampled it and perhaps i will order that for myself next time.  i'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  \u000a\u000amore to my tastes however are the garden chicken, chicken with broccoli, or beef with pea pods.  seafood dishes include sweet and sour shrimp and  sauteed shrimp szechaun style.  yeah, i'm a little unimaginative when it comes to chinese food, but i know what i like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!\u000a\u000ajimmy tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  the place also does korean barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.

Vyou can see their second bar through the front windows.  i always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\u000a\u000ain other words, this place is *huge* inside.  the place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; i like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \u000a\u000achinese and korean food, at or above my expectations.  the stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.

Vi happen to stumble upon jimmy tsang's while up in pittsburgh visiting. i must say, the food is really good. the service was great - but i only had a drink there with my boyfriend and we got take out. we liked it so much, we got take out for my family 2 nights later. \u000a\u000athe woman that runs the front is very nice / sociable and likes to talk about each dish. she has great suggestions for your taste. her husband is the chef (they are both from korea) and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years. if you like chinese food, you will love this place. it also has two cool bars inside. \u000a\u000ai highly recommend this place. the reason why i give it 4 stars is because we got take out - not sure how table service is, but i'm sure it would be good with the nice people working there.... \u000a\u000aa must try! i bet it would be a cool first date kind of place....

Vwalking into jimmy tsang's was like walking into the chinese restaurant that was on hawaii five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\u000a\u000ahot & sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\u000awonton soup was a very large portion and good.\u000a\u000aegg rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\u000acheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\u000achinese flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\u000aflaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\u000a\u000atea tasted like american lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\u000a\u000athe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.

Vi really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  first, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  i'm writing this review after going there twice.  the first time my husband and i went, the dinner was good.  we thought this place has the potential to be our go-to chinese restaurant in pgh.  today i remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  the won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  the entree was fine.  \u000a\u000awhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   i had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  the smell wouldn't leave me so i came home to rinse my mouth with listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as i could) to get rid of the smell.  did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \u000a\u000a[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]

Vhey, jimmy! cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! the early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\u000ai had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). i'm going to avoid this place until i get a craving to drink tobacco.

Vi was expecting a lot more from jt but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way. it merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. the idea was cute. they even have typical chinese lunch specials.\u000a\u000athe deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. \u000a\u000ai had a craving for comfort food and ordered jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. the tea and water was served as i sat down. i went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. the calamari came out promptly and the jajangmyeon took a little longer. the portions were huge! \u000a\u000awhat took the longest and annoyed me the most (i was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes? they never came the clear the table or walked by so that i could signal that i needed the check. i should have just walked out. the food was okay but i seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn't help with. you may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break.

Vif you want a true understanding of pittsburgh in the morning, come here. this greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.\u000a\u000athey serve waffles in halves, which is great. the eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. the drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.\u000a\u000aif you're hungry, get "the mixed grill"... gab and eat's brand of the "kitchen sink" breakfast that all midwest places are about.

Vstick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  first time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  breakfast has no losers.  eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.\u000a\u000afrequently voted the best burger in pittsburgh for a reason.  as for ambiance, well lets just say i don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  but the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  if i don't get there for awhile i need to go through detox because i feel too healthy.

Vthe biggest breakfast in pittsburgh, as far as i can tell - and delicious and cheap too. i ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. oh, and a side of toast. for under $5, if i recall.\u000a\u000ahuge portions, all well-executed; as good as deluca's.\u000a\u000ai've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.\u000a\u000acramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination.

Vokay, let's first set expectations.  this place is a true dive...this is not for the nyc foodie crowd.  if you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  the place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  the best part - they have "dippy" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  for anyone who has never heard of a "dippy" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  the eggs were great - i ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh italian bread.  yum!!!

Vi miss this place. when i return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. when i think of pittsburgh, i remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. go here and you will be happy you did.

Vi've lived in pittsburgh for 6 years, and in carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint i've found. if you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \u000a\u000ahere are the highlights:\u000a\u000a-cheap: breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\u000a-crowded: get there early and expect to wait. they close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\u000a-cash only\u000a-huge portions: when ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\u000a-about those homefries: they're often undercooked. i've had better, believe me. my favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\u000a-my favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo

Vmy favorite breakfast place.  have good sandwiches also.  stopped again for bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real man!  mixed grill has sausage, (could it be ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  use mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - yum.  \u000a\u000ahave had many other items and just love the food.  if you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!\u000a\u000alunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.\u000a\u000agets busy for bfast so you may have to wait.\u000a\u000aremember it is a diner.  don't expect fancy decor.

Vdefinitely a greasy spoon! always packed here and always a wait but worth it. the omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. i also like the mixed grill.  my parents love their burgers. took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive.

Vif you're looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place. i got the mixed grill half portion and was very full. make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter. loved the breakfast and would go back. not much room for sitting down but worth the wait.

Vok, what is with all of these "cash only" places in pittsburgh? i can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an atm?  in the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \u000a\u000alooking at a standard breakfast menu, i decided to go with a tuna melt instead. what i got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. i had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. one day later i can't even remember what my side was. i suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  i have to say that the dessert was really good! the cherry pecan pie! i have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! the cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. i think i want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\u000a\u000amy first impression is "eh."  i am learning how crazy pittsburghers are over breakfast! seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \u000a\u000a"2 eggs and toast $x.xx"\u000a"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx"\u000a"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx"\u000a\u000ai'd rather go to a denny's and order the "create your own grand slam!"

Vbest diner in the counrty!!! we've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  gab and eat the best rating !! i was a little intimidated when i first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  if you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but everything i ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  after trying like every meal they have i would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  burgers are great too.\u000a\u000ait's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  the atmosphere is classy, old school americana.

Vreaders of my reviews may recall that i once referred to the dor-stop as possibly the best breakfast in pittsburgh.  well, faithful followers, i must now admit that the dor-stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  why?  that's because gab and eat i have now found to be the best breakfast i've ever had.  if it was closer to my home i would quickly become a regular.\u000a\u000ai easily decided to order the mixed grill (half).  before i go on, i must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  because i honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  i created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  based on reviews i also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  i like variety, so i jumped on the change to try both.  i also selected the italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \u000a\u000awhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  there was so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like i'd barely started.  the sausage was great, just don't ask me which one i liked best.  my toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. it was a struggle, but i was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \u000a\u000ain case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  i saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  the wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  the fact that none of the plates match and i noticed a sign at the front register that said, "we need mugs" just makes me love this place even more.\u000a\u000aa few tips: 1.) order the mixed grill.  2.) cash only!  3.) gab and eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  i recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  that way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) get to gab and eat asap!  you'll be glad you did!

Vclassic breakfast joint.  grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. on the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  when you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\u000a\u000awhat's the attraction behind this flea hole?  the food!  lots of it and dirt cheap.  i sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and italian toast.  a giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  i swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  all that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  cash only, so put that plastic away.\u000a\u000aonly bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the food network or travel channel will make this place famous, and then i'll never be able to get in.

Vyum - freaking - me!\u000a\u000aas the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    a couple of recommendations:\u000a\u000a- don't eat early in the week \u000a- i don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave\u000a\u000a\u000a i walked in for breakfast one early weekday am.   the place was packed with locals and regulars.    a very good sign.\u000a\u000amy co-worker recommended i get the mixed grill.   i ordered the large mix grill.   my waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    i ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.\u000a\u000afood - \u000a\u000athe mixed grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     \u000a\u000aportion -\u000a\u000athis should have been a man vs food episode.   i was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   it was really good.\u000a\u000aservice - \u000a\u000amy waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   she was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.\u000a\u000aprice - \u000a\u000athe cost ranges $5 - 10.\u000a\u000a\u000ai will definitely go back after i buy some new stretchy pants.

Vbest breakfast spot in the area, if you like diner food it is the place to go. small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on sundays, but the wait is never too long.  everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  if you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious.

Vgreat breakfast, good price. you might have to stand outside in line though, so i don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. they have great deserts and such also. bring your cash though as they dont' take cards.

Vi always love a good diner.  gab and eat was just what we were looking for on a saturday morning.  good food.  great people. pittsburgh ambiance. \u000a\u000athis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  i had french toast and bacon.  the french toast was made with the best italian bread.  my fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill."  it consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   they also had great coffee.  they actually ground up the beans in front of us.  now that's fresh.\u000a\u000awe want to return sometime for "turkey day."  apparently they made fresh turkey every tuesday.  now that sounds good!\u000a\u000acan't wait to return.

Vthis is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates.

Von our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try gab & eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in pittsburgh area. we have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\u000awe arrived around noon on saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. the place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. there is plenty of parking.\u000ainside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. we regretted not having a marker to add ours. the other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\u000athe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. they are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\u000aafter reading reviews i had to try the mixed grill. but s went with pancakes with a side of bacon. the pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. they were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \u000ahis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\u000athe mixed grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy italian sausage grilled together. i'm glad i heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. it filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. i couldn't finish it all and that's rare. how do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\u000aeverything was cooked well. the sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. you can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\u000amy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. i like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. these potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. personal preference.\u000ait usually comes with italian toast but they were out so i went with raisin. it was delicious soft inch thick slices.\u000acoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. the total was less than $15. fabulous value for the quality and portions.\u000awhile i can't say it's the best breakfast in pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.

Vmet my nephew for lunch in carnegie and he suggested gab & eat.   way to go justin!  the restaurant is in a strip mall across from the dairy queen.  the grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   they have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. they have a great looking breakfast menu.   we all got burgers of varying kinds!  they were tasty!   the buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   we ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  both of which were great.  the half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   the restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  i give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  at least she didn't throw the food when it came!   she also served the fries and onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   they were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   it didn't factor into my four star rating but i deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   just kidding justin!   love ya!

Vthis is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. i had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon\u000a\u000athe coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. the waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. the food was excellent. the ambience was exactly right for a diner. it was packed. the wait was not nearly as long as i was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.\u000a\u000atotally recommended. come hungry.

Vi have been coming to gab n eat for almost 20 years and they have never let me down. i get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. delicious as usual. the ambience however is usually lacking. the walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. while its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. so today when i arrived i expected the same old experience. wow was i wrong! as soon as i looked at the door i knew something was different. the place seemed lighter and brighter. to my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! they're not quite done yet but the place has a new happy vibe to it. the awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why i will be back( maybe for lunch).

Vprepare to be wowed. \u000a\u000ahigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. i thought i would try some of the world famous cuisine so i pulled up on a thursday evening. "garçon" i asked, "may i try some of your french fried potatoes?" i was greeted with a crackled mutter as i inched my vehicle forward. i was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom i could hear laughing and socializing through my window. whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. after some deep meditation, i realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so i pulled away. i cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. i highly recommend this palace of excellence.

Vi don't expect much from fast food restaurants. but i do expect to be spoken to when i am a paying customer. i just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. there was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. i don't think i've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. \u000a\u000amaybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down.

Vi have to admit, the first time i hate here, i absolutely hated the pizza. and i think it was because i was expecting something completely different than i got. latina pizza is very different from most pizza shops. instead if a round thin crust pizza, this pizza is square, thick, and doughy. the crust is not really that good, but that is not why you get a pizza here. it's the homemade sauce. and that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. \u000a\u000athe other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to kennywood. so usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. no lines, no waiting for tables, no outrageous prices. it's a time to recharge, and sometimes we feel like going back to the park,  other times we decide to go home.

Vgood pizza at a great price. the unique crust that's both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody, but our whole group liked it. the sauce is good too, light but with a good tomato flavor. \u000a\u000athe best thing about this place is the management. they went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast. and the prices: we fed everybody in under $40, with plenty of leftovers taken home.

Vwe had the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. our waitress (annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. we ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \u000a\u000aone of my friends ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. but the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. when pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! how crude! \u000a\u000aspoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \u000a\u000awhen i asked the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! what a lame excuse! even your online menu says under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - "served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked kaiser roll." - that's what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich says. shame on you manager for lying! instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\u000a\u000anot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \u000a\u000ai am never going to come back to any eat n park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. what a waste of time and money! plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, i surely had my patience tested this evening!

Vmuch like every other eat 'n park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times i've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  it's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while i've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs.

Vif you must eat at eat n park, this is the one you want to go to. why you ask? the corporate offices are right next door and the suits are there every day, breakfast lunch and dinner. \u000a\u000awhen i spend a few hours with dear old mom, she enjoyed spending a day at the waterfront, she loved the since closed 39 center store, where she could buy her monthly greeting cards for 39 cents each. then we drive over to this eat n park where she has her breakfast smile and i enjoy an egg beater sandwich and fresh fruit.\u000a\u000athis place is spotless, the salad bar always looks fresh and the food is good, for a chain.

Vi like this eat'n park. even though it is a chain, not all of them are created equal. the wait staff and kitchen staff really make a big difference in whether or not an eat'n park is worth patronizing.  eating here, i change my mentality a bit. i always order the seven dollar bbq burger with the salad bar add on for two dollars. in my mind, i always see myself ordering the seven dollar salad bar with a two dollar hamburger. when the salad bar is kept stocked, it has some really good and fresh items. i love that they have spinach and not just iceburg lettuce. i wish other eat'n parks were more like this one.

Vthe food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost always very very slow. most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. although they still technically do their job, you can feel very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. it's a hit and miss. unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. the low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.

Veat n park is usually decent.  this location though has horribly slow service.  seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  it's not.  doesn't matter what time we go.  it seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a "closed" section.  that server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  i told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  i've never had this issue at any other enp.  we left, drove to the squirrel hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the waterfront.  mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  get your hosts and servers on the same page!

Vthis is by far my favorite panera location in the pittsburgh area. friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free wifi! try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.

Vi live close by so i go here frequently pretty much for the free wifi and espresso. but here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an americano is so often i am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. there is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from victoria secrets, ulta, wet seal and the other various shops at this water front location.

Vhad lunch here after getting my nails done in the waterfront.  it's your standard panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  our food was made very quickly, even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a saturday).  chicken noodle soup is tasty, but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  i tried their sierra chicken sandwich for the first time, and it was pretty good.  it's very flavorful, i like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  it was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.\u000a\u000aif i have to get a quick, light meal and only chain options are available, panera is my best choice.  it's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  but there isn't much special about it, of course.

Vi really enjoy panera, and this restaurant meets my expectations. i particularly love the asiago cheese bagel, caesar salad, bacon turkey bravo sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, smokehouse turkey panini, broccoli cheddar soup, and iced chai tea latte. i've ordered all of these items at this location, and they have been very tasty.\u000a\u000ai have had this location run out of the side of french baguette once or twice. however, last time that occurred, i asked for a bread bowl as a replacement, which i was given for free.\u000a\u000ai'll definitely be returning soon!

Vi've had bad experiences here a few times now.  i wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  bad service all around!!!  basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  when we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  its not very good at all.

Vit's the same panera food you've had before.  i like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one.  that said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough.\u000a\u000athey have warm cookies for $2.00.  that is a nice feature.

Vi like panera bread but this one is a so so. i always get my fuji chicken salad in every panera bread i go. all of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. they just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. i was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but i am disappointed after trying it. don't know if we will be back again.

Vit seems silly to rate a chain so i won't talk about the food. \u000a\u000ai just love coming to this panera because it's right by barnes and noble.  i recently started getting into the panera card. compared to the other paneras i have to say that this one seems cleaner, bigger, and all around nicer.  of course i would never go out of my way to get here but if you're at barnes and noble and aren't happy with the sandwiches there (which i was) i would venture on over to panera.

Vpanera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to. i have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. the first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. it did not even look appetizing.

Vthe food was fine. it's a chain. i'm not rating it. \u000a\u000athe service was absolutely horrible. it started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \u000a\u000abetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when i told her i did not ask for what she brought me, i really can't decide which is worse. i rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from panera employees.

Vthis use to be my go to panera bread.  when i worked in the area i would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  i was happy when i left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  my waist also appreciated it.  those scones are delicious.\u000a\u000ai recently stopped back here when i was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  with all my new allergies i came in here hoping to get some bread.  not knowing, nor doing my homework before i showed up, i asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  after looking through it for a few minutes i was able to select the bread i wanted.  they will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  if you would rather slice yourself, i am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  but it is much better tasting.

Vthis is a pretty decent arby's, and given the condition of the other fast food restaurants on this stretch of ohio river, it practically reaches exceptional.  the dining room is clean and nicely modern.  the service is friendly.  i don't think i've ever had a bad experience.

Varby's is definitely king of the fast food joints on the blvd.  for that, i'd give it five stars.  however, it's still fast food, which explains the mediocre rating.  do not go here without a coupon from the sunday paper--there's a whole page of them at least once a month.  the staff here is very nice and very fast, and on the whole, the food is better than elsewhere by the river if you're stuck with a fast food choice.

Vbarb's country junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a pittsburgh restaurant should be.  in addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when i'm hungry on the weekends.  \u000a\u000abarb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. my recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  there's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\u000a\u000ai know that gab n eat is nearby, and barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of carnegie that you've gotta try!

Vmy first time going to barb's country junction and i really wanted to like this place, i really did...however, i didn't.\u000a\u000athe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. i got pancakes, bacon and eggs. the pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. my son had a burger and it was good. the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. i would give the food 3/5.\u000a\u000athe service was subpar for sure. while our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. she got the order messed up and so on. i give the service 2/5.\u000a\u000athe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. it also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. a customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. i give the interior 2/5.\u000a\u000athe prices were decent. i fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. i give the prices 3/5.\u000a\u000aso in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. there are better diners in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barb's.

Vmy husband and i tried this place for the first time today. it was easy to find and no problems with parking. it's "seat yourself", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. it took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and i'm guessing that this was barb. she apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. no big deal and her apology was appreciated. she came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. we didn't see her for another 20 minutes. ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. this was aggravating to me. i don't mind waiting for my food if i know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. we ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. the food was alright, really nothing special. a new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. we may or may not go back.

Vdon don is a restaurant i find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in carnegie. simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a tv. oddly enough i think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. the food is average but i always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get chinese food.

Vi used to order takeout here once every month or so. the food tastes average and the price is good. it's your typical low-end chinese place. \u000a\u000athe last (and final) time i ordered here i just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. while i was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. he also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. the inspector looked at me like i was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \u000a\u000aas for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. the carpets are just filthy and the walls match. there are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \u000a\u000athe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness don don is lacking.

Vdelicious singapore noodles and seafood delight. crispy flavorful crab rangoon, and cold sesame noodles done well (but could've used a bit more sauce). excellent real chinese food, friendly service.  restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality.

Vi came here with two friends prior to visiting apis meadery next door this past weekend.  i ordered the general tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  they ordered the combo with less meat, and i ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which i found confusing. the food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so i'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  while we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).\u000a\u000ato be honest, i'm not much of a fan of americanized chinese cuisine (i lived in singapore for 3 mos. and have visited hong king and japan); it's been awhile since i've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  i don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do i care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (i like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  having said that, my friends claimed this was the best americanized chinese fare they'd had in pgh (and they live in squirrel hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.\u000a\u000aif nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which i appreciated.

Vall i can say is the worst! we were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. a fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\u000a\u000aour food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. of course its cold, just like the room, i never took my jacket off! the plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. the fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\u000a\u000awe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a solo cup for 2 people. i asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. what chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\u000a\u000aover all.... my first and last visit to this place. the only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so.

Vlots of memories from this place for me.  their pizza may not be the best in the world but boy does it take me back to the 80's-90's and growing up in pittsburgh.\u000a\u000ai am slightly disappointed that they moved to a new location in bellevue.  their old one, while a bit dirty and run down, had quite the charm to it.  the new place looks too clean cut and it seems like they're trying to be something they're not, which is just a good old fashioned pizza joint.

Vbest pizza in the north boros.  i can't make a trip to the area without stopping at luigi's.  when i was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  i prefer the thin-crust, but the sicilian is also excellent.  the fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  the calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed.  because it's pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  i tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section.

Vi have been eating at luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). the new location is nice, but i miss the coziness of the old place. \u000athe food has been consistent through the transition, which happened a long while ago by the way. also, i have read a few other reviews that said luigi's has left but i talk with him every time i am in. regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and i recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :).

Vi stopped by here this past tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  my fiance, a friend and i were trying pizza from three different places and luigi's was one of them.  i have driven by luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever i was looking for a pizza place i had not yet tried in the bellevue area.  whenever i called to place my order i was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  i arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever i walked into the restaurant.  you see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and i didn't immediately see the are where i would get my pizza from.  finally after a few steps into the restaurant i noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where i needed to be and i made my way back there.  my pizza was ready for me and i quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me "stay out of trouble".  i really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  the pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since i could see a ton of green herbs in it.  the cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which i did not enjoy.  out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\u000a\u000athe bottom line for me is that i will probably not head back to luigi's in the future.  i just don't see myself making a trip to luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that i had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.

Vrecently i've found myself patronizing bellevue a little more, namely because i've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of mayberry rfd that is the quaint main street. luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic italian in a comfortable setting. it's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with dino and frankie tunes playing in the background.\u000a\u000ai've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. it's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.\u000a\u000athe portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering chef boyardee either. the service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. \u000a\u000athe crowd can fluctuate between 'oh my god, i'm surrounded by hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.\u000a\u000ai've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly i only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when i'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. but i've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. they taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.\u000a\u000aand for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what i'd hope for. a place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. \u000a\u000aand that is exactly what luigi's is.

Vluigis is the best of the best. awesome, authentic pepperoni. i have eaten here for years. this place is a tradition in my family and it's still as good as they were 15 years ago. they recently remodeled and have a great menu selection. by far the best pizza in bellevue and right up there with fioris as the best in pittsburgh.

Vthis place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  now...  not so much.  well, during hh, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  selection by the glass is limited.  \u000a\u000aas for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  i haven't really been disappointed yet!  the appetizers/small plates all pretty good, i really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  the salads are good and although i haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, i hear great things from my friends.  the entrees are always excellent - i usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  the signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  the desserts are ok, personally, i feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  \u000a\u000aoh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  and it is nice that you can order veuve cliquot by the glass ($16).\u000a\u000aprices are a bit high for what you'd expect for pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, i would recommend it.\u000a\u000ap.s. i have heard that they have a great brunch on sundays. i personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments i hear, it's probably worth the try!\u000a\u000a-------------------------\u000aupdate 12/9/07:  went to the brunch.  what a great deal!  for $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  they have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  the smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  the truffled potato was yummy.  the arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  and for entree, we both got the casbah benedict.  i have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  i think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!

Vwell it's official shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  damn you big burrito group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  i was here last night and on a monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  the space itself is beautiful.  you  enter from s. highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  there is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  the design is contemporary.  the bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  the one thing i dislike about the bar area is that the "stools" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your "neighbor" is pre-determined.  i also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  the wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  the hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  the server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  we ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and i guess in line with what others charge.  we were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta i think.  the tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but i guess it's what i should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  the bread was great.  it was warm really hearty bread that was wheat i think, definitely not white.  it was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  really good start.  we then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  i'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  it also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  the only thing i was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  however, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  we also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  the pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  the sauce and lamb were amazing.  this would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  the only detraction i'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  we also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  by the time we got to this i think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  this is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  but, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  i tried the elysian fields lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  this was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  i actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  the bartenders are good, especially fionaoverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.

Vthe food here is pretty good.  comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  the lamb is definitely good.  and it is definitely a good date restaurant.  i would rather give it 3.5 stars since i've definitely eaten at better restaurants. but for pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up.

Vi went to casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. they use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. i had the house made granola which was just amazing! toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. after the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a bellini and a cup of coffee, i had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag ("the rest" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\u000a\u000amy only complaint would be how long everything took. while i love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. i go into brunch groggy, then i have coffee and yummy food, and i'm totally amped, ready to face the day! and then i get to sit. and wait. anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now i'll know to make time the next time i go. which is for dinner for a friends birthday. so excited!!

Vcan be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  we had a cheese tasting simply because i *never* pass up pleasant ridge reserve when given the opportunity.  they also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from cypress grove.  nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  i had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  the feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  i spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\u000a\u000aservice was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.

Vafter a long day of recruiting at cmu, i arranged a dinner for 16 people here in casbah... prefix menu, over all the experience was ok.\u000a\u000abreak down:\u000ascallops - appetizer - i had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  \u000afillet mignon - entree - very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the silicon valley or even some of the chain steak places like morton's.\u000adessert - the highlight of the of the meal.  mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  it was amazing.  the consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  it wasn't too dense or too liquidy.\u000a\u000abeing a big burrito restaurant, i expected more but it was good nonetheless.

Vso i went back to casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. the granola i had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. the service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. definitely go for brunch! but it's not worth the money for dinner. mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food...

Vi'm not sure why this place is called casbah.  casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.\u000a\u000athat aside, good food and great service.  definitely a place to impress.  i especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although casbah is not doing the whole "locavore" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  so, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.\u000a\u000awe started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  but the calamari was meaty and perfectly fried.  i actually had to stop because i was feeling ill from eating too many of them.\u000a\u000awe all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  quite sizeable too, given the setting.  finally, i had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (i have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  which was quite good.  i actually would have preferred it over linguine, i think, but whatever.  it was deelish.\u000a\u000anot sure why i'm not giving this place five stars.  i really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a wow experience.  better luck next time perhaps.

Vanother great big burrito restaurant, casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\u000a\u000athe three dinning rooms, "outside," inside and downstairs.  while downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  perfect for a larger group of people.  outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\u000a\u000athe food is mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. the hummus here was actually the first hummus that i had ever had and i am sorry to say it is what i compare all other to, few match up.\u000a\u000athe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to soba.  if you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, casbah is it.

Vi was pleased to finally find a place in pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. i tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing i could have made the meal better myself. not here.\u000a\u000athe food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. i had made it a point to never eat fish in a pittsburgh restaurant but casbah changed my mind. the cod dish i had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! \u000a\u000adecor is subtle and great for a date. service was friendly and accommodating.  i will most definitely return!

Vgreat great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.  the wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list.  the food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown.  everything is so fresh and pretty, you almost don't want to eat it.  the wine list is extensive, and although it can be pricey, they have great happy hour specials.

Vmeh.  seriously?  mediterranean?  what?  sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant mediterranean.\u000a\u000athis was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  the food was good, and i had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.\u000a\u000athat said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy.

Vi have been coming to casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  i very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  over the years i have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  i have ever encountered (although i no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops i will ever eat).  \u000a\u000athis is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  one plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on sundays.  their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  my one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. i always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  this cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.\u000a\u000aothers may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  my wife and i have often dined here with our kids.  this semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  you can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners.

Vamazing brunch! i'd never been to casbah before until this past sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\u000a\u000afor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. an incredible price for a serious amount of great food. they had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. from huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. the appetizers list was equally as large. \u000a\u000ai started with a bloody mary. was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. very good. for an appetizer i got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. there was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. all were wonderful. for my entree i went with the salmon eggs benedict. it was perfect. the fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\u000a\u000ai tasted a couple of other things as well. both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. the only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \u000a\u000aalso, service was absolutely perfect. we had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers i've ever had. the table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. one of the best experiences i've had for restaurant service anywhere.\u000a\u000afor brunch in pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. not to be missed!\u000a\u000anow i just need to make plans to go back for dinner.

Vthere is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. that said, i had the best pork chop i've ever had here and for that i was endlessly thankful. good salad, delicious bread and hummus. great service. for pittsburgh, top notch.

Vmy best friend and i went here for dinner today and were very pleased - though i do have to say that we both had our free birthday entrees and that undoubtedly influenced things.  i was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.\u000a\u000awe started with two big glasses of sangria.  i thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or i got used to it.\u000a\u000ai had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  i had never had morels before and now i understand why they're so pricey.  there was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  the risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind i wish i could make myself.  my best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  i tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.\u000a\u000awe split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote happy birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  the creme brulee was good but definitely not the best i've ever had.  (that award may go to soba's coffee creme brulee.)\u000a\u000athe total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  but it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  the patio was lovely.  i will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto!

Vthis is my favorite big burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \u000a\u000agotta be honest, though. just about every time i'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, i don't have a crystal clear memory of what i had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \u000a\u000awhat i can tell you is that i had never been disappointed with anything i've ordered here. and believe you me, if the food is not that good, i will remember it no matter how drunk i am. sure, it's not exactly a "mediterranean" restaurant, but who cares? the food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \u000a\u000ai do recall that the very last time i ate here was with a dear friend and two of her british colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. i had the arugula --one of my favorite words. it's lovely, no? say it with me. a -ru-gu-la! fun, right?!! and so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. what about dessert, you ask? sorry, kids. by that time i really was drunk, and i can't remember. it was super tasty, though! i remember everyone liking mine the best. sure do, sugar!\u000a\u000aso pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. it's a great date or small group place. oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!

Vexcellent place for brunch.  for $22, i had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  reservations available through open table.  this is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable.

Vone of my all time favorite restaurants in pgh, casbah is still going strong 15 years later. today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. they use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable, interesting fresh food around.  also great for sunday brunch.  you won't be disappointed.

Vexcellent excellent brunch spot.  for review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\u000a\u000acasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  i ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  i started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  my companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\u000a\u000awhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\u000a\u000athe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  there was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  i tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\u000a\u000amy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  i love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  the braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  the best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  this dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  i tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (i think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\u000a\u000aservice was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, and they take reservations.  sometimes i don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (point brugge, coca cafe, etc.), but most times i'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.

Vsuch a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in shadyside. we planned in advance to come here after i received big burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. the food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. my favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.\u000a\u000aafter reading everyone else's reviews, i hope to come back here next for brunch.\u000a\u000a**to take big burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! it was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.

Vi really wanted to like casbah after checking out the menu online.  i really wanted to like casbah once i saw the super cool dark interior of the restaurant.  unfortunately, everything started to go down hill from there....\u000a\u000athe waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner, which i found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant.  my friend and i order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start.  the tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and i wasn't into the creme fraiche on top.  the salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  i had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on yelp, but i didn't like the sauce that accompanied it.  my friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthused.\u000a\u000adon't get me wrong, nothing about my meal was terrible, but nothing about my meal was spectacular either.   it looks like maybe i should have tried brunch.  we shall see if i'm willing to give casbah another chance....

Vout of the big burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. and this is just not a one time bad experience, i have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.\u000a\u000aservice has always been good and attentive i enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or i expected much better for the money i am paying. for example:\u000a\u000asumac scallop appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is i can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant i am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.\u000a\u000arisotto - over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.\u000a\u000aduck entrée, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. i even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.\u000a\u000apasta entrée with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.\u000a\u000aif this was some little bistro where i was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) i wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money i expect a little more attention to detail.

Vi'm a big fan of all the big burrito restaurants i've tried (eleven, umi, mad mex & casbah). i think eleven is my favorite, but casbah is a very close second. \u000a\u000amy most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. we started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. for entrees, i had the casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. for dessert, i had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). \u000a\u000athe grilled flat bread came with three different dips, humus, red pepper hummus, and baba ganoush. i really enjoyed all three, but thought the red pepper hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. the butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. \u000a\u000aas far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. my pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. the sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. the sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. i can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. \u000a\u000ai tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall i thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. incredibly tender and flavorful. \u000a\u000aneither of us were too impressed with our desserts. the creme brulee was very good, but at that point, i expected it to be great. my wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. \u000a\u000athe bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. \u000a\u000aalso, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. i asked his opinion on the french malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.

Vone of my favorite restaurants in the world.  \u000a\u000aexcellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  menu changes up pretty regularly and i've never had a bad dish there.  the stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. the scallops were also fantastic. the front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.\u000a\u000arevision: \u000a\u000ai was just back at casbah for a fundraising dinner.  once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  all proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.\u000a\u000amy dinner was so good, i literally almost cried.  the wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things i've ever eaten in my life.  short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing i ate that evening, but i found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  i had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  the cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  it was amazing!\u000a\u000awhile i don't believe these are regular menu items, i highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  that they made no money off of.  an area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in pittsburgh.

Vpart of the same restaurant group as eleven, which i have eaten at and reviewed here, casbah is a vibrant restaurant in pittsburgh's shadyside district.\u000a\u000awhile the menu changes daily, there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  one of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest i have ever had.  double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.\u000a\u000ai managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  the short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  the ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.\u000a\u000aservice was a little hit or miss the evening i was there.  part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  however, for an establishment of this caliber, i do expect more.  nevertheless, i plan on trying casbah again on my next trip to pittsburgh.

Vwe decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to casbah.  we were surprised  by the huge tent covering the "outdoor" dining area.  we opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  for brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  \u000a\u000afor our drinks, bj had a bloody mary and i had a bellini.  we were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  for appetizers, we got a three sisters farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  very good.  for entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the ny strip steak.  very relaxing and tasty meal.

Vi was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until i made a disturbing discovery...\u000a\u000ai made a reservation for inside. they sat us outside. that turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that were available inside were very close to others. the patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. anyway, it was hot under the space-ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. the food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. the bread was the best i've had in pittsburgh. our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, "the host is supposed to do that but i will..." run on. when i described the qualities i was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. the wine list did not include descriptions. the gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that i did not want this cheapest option before me! she described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \u000a\u000ai was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that i sought it out at the wine and spirits store. this was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. i am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. if you want to do your own math: at casbah the 1/2 bottle of gruet blanc du noirs cost $35, while a whole bottle at w&s is priced at $16.99. you can bet that i will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like avenue b (byob), next time. \u000a\u000acasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\u000a\u000a**update: i recently saw a full size bottle of the gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; casbah, take a tip!

Vi went on a date with my girlfriend here, and it was a great experience.  charming outside dining area with excellent service and a knowledgeable staff.  i will say that the food was a bit overpriced, but that's to be expected in shadyside.  great selection of fresh seafood - i had the salmon and it was delicious.  reasonably priced wine list, as well. i would recommend casbah for a special event or if you're rolling in the $$.

Vmy boyfriend took me to casbah for my birthday this march. this is one of our twice-a-year splurges and i have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\u000awe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. we were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. the menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\u000awe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. i have a gluten allergy and i have missed ravioli quite a bit, so i was happy to eat this. the flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which i like. \u000afor entree, i had the double-cut pork chop. this was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. it was an enormous portion, as well - i took some home and ate it the next day!\u000amy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. he was less thrilled with his dish, and when i tasted it, i agreed. i normally love seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. it tasted a little too "fishy" and i didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \u000ainstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. i do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but i guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\u000awe are great fans of the big burrito restaurants, and i think we preferred our experience at soba to casbah. while our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. and i wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!

Vwent here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a sunday. anyway, we got the brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! yum. we sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. \u000a\u000afor my 2 courses i got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. it was honestly, amazing. i loved it. it came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. i would come back just to have that for breakfast. for the main dish i got a crab omelette. it came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. the potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. not the best i have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.\u000a\u000ait was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. this place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. we had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.

Vfor our last lunch in pittsburgh we decided to return to the big burrito group; eleven was quite good and both gayot and pittsburgh magazine compared the experience at casbah favorably to that of big burrito's crown jewel.  citing a mix of mediterranean and northern african influences with a bargain piccola gusto menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\u000a\u000awhen our server, a young woman named amanda l who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  when amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  with my mom and sister opting for the two-course gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\u000a\u000awaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at eleven.  after this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...i'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\u000a\u000afinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be "right out."  while i guess she didn't define "right out," what this actually meant was "in 25 minutes."  starting first with my mother's combo - jumbo lump crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and orecchiette pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, riverview farms goat cheese, sage cream. while the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\u000a\u000avastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the grilled vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  beginning with the sandwich, the bite i had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but i'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  for the first time in the meal amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more orcchiette.\u000a\u000afor my main course i received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  the salad, of course, was served alongside elysian fields lamb "mac and cheese", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, pecorino-romano, and bread crumbs.  piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent macaroni and cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\u000a\u000acompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  with my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and i skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with "just the bill."\u000a\u000asettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality amanda may have actually be the worst server i've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  i will note that when i wrote to big burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  he closed with "i hope you will join us again." i will not.

Vi ate here in january and was very impressed. we ate in the basement, although casbah has two floors and outdoor seating. i thought the atmosphere was very good, and the fish (i forget the exact dish) was well-prepared.\u000a\u000athis is on the expensive side, but worth it for a special occasion.

Vanother one of pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  the best things about casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).\u000a\u000ai had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and i really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time i have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? after all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is really cool, i recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  the only negative things i can say about casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (i expected more of a middle eastern menu and vibe).

Vi had lunch here on a hot saturday, so we skipped the outdoor seating in the front and opted for the air-conditioned interior. \u000a\u000athe sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  i had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn, but both flavors held their own very well.  the chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet i had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  i did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  the bookends of my meal were so delicious that i wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.\u000a\u000awhile i can't afford casbah on a regular basis as a grad student, the prices aren't exorbitant.  there's even a lunch special for $14, which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup, and your choice of a pasta, risotto, or half a sandwich.  i didn't choose this option, but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.\u000a\u000aour server was very professional, and checked on us after every course (the appetizer, entrees and dessert).  i'll definitely keep casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  it's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.

Vif i could, i'd dock a half star after my second visit.  but i feel positively enough about my first meal there, that taking off a whole star seems harsh.  \u000a\u000ai got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for big burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit casbah.  the good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  my maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  the pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  it was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but i was happy with the choice.  \u000a\u000anow, onto the weird.  after taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  my friend and i are both twentysomething women.  luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  we like to eat.  yes, bring the bread.\u000a\u000awhen he brought our entrees, he sang "happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  i don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so i'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple "happy birthday" would have sufficed.  then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was "everything [i] wanted, and more."  i appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.\u000a\u000ahe asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  uh, what?  i think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  \u000a\u000ato redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an id.  i recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  when he returned my id to me, our waiter said, "i like the short hair."  if this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, i would have taken it as a compliment.  i guess it is one.  but when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and i both felt awkward.\u000a\u000athe food here is good and i feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service i had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.  i'd feel leery, though, if i were to have this particular server again.

Vthe food was excellent--i had the roasted garlic cream appetizer and orecchiette, but between our table, we tried half of the menu with no complaints.  the port flight was unique and the wine list was good.  the bartender has a little trouble with our cocktail orders, but those were good as well.  the covered patio was perfect for a friday evening in late august--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  the service was so-so, which i'm docking a star for.  the server was attentive, but she was a little slow.  she also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.  it gets crowded, so make a reservation.\u000a\u000amad mex is still my favorite big burrito restaurant, but casbah is great for a more formal gathering or date night.

Vi ate here for brunch on sunday.  it's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  it included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  i had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  all was great.  they could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  the bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  i will definitely be returning for brunch!

Vgreat atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\u000a\u000acasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy.

Vthis restaurant really knows how to cook meat and fish.  the fried calamari (appetizer) was cooked to perfection with a perfect batter and tender beyond belief.  the duck course (entree) was the most tender meat i have ever eaten.  it was probably overly harsh, but only gave four stars because the side of risotto and the sauce on the duck didn't blow me away.  the maple panna cotta dessert was also incredible.  it was a custard with a light cookie and cranberry comfit on top, phenom.

Vi've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and i'd have to say that generally, i'm a fan.  their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  it was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\u000a\u000ai came back for dinner a month or so later.  we had reservations (on a monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  we sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, mediterranean garden.  and yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  even with my young eyes, i still needed a candle to read the menu.  but it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  a little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\u000a\u000athe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  i actually had a cocktail to start - the perfect pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  there was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  it was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors i love.  still, for the price, i think the portion was a little stingy.  when i buy an $11 cocktail, i like it to really fill the glass.  we nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - i think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  it was a bit bland - i think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\u000a\u000athings got better during the actual dinner.  i ordered the heritage farms chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  it's just squash!  but somehow, it was heavenly.  my friend enjoyed her cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  i tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  the only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  i tasted them too, and i have to say - it was off-putting.  perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.\u000a\u000awe also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  i didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  i enjoyed our creme brulee - because i enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  \u000a\u000aoverall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  i had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  but this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  i think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.

Vthe interior is very nice. the food is a hit or miss. we went for brunch today. you can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. the appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. the entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. we got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. the omelet was very bland. it did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. basically, i have had better omelets at some denny's. my drink mimosa was just ok. my girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. \u000a\u000ai have been to casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. the first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. it gradually went down to 3 stars. the wine selection is good. but the food is definitely hit or miss. once i had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. it was not well cooked or fresh, or something. consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.

Vgreat food and very nice decor, one of my favorite restaurants outside downtown pitt.  the best places around pitt are the bars or bar/restaurants (some of the best in the country imo).  but if you're looking for a straight-up classy place to eat, it's a tough place to beat.

Vlast night was the first time that we had been to casbah in a long time - we used to absolutely love it, but a couple of disappointing brunch and dinner experiences had put us off of it. however, we decided to give it another chance, and i am glad that we did. \u000a\u000aeven though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. it was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. wow, was she cheerful and friendly! she was also helpful with making recommendations - when i asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new "beet and potato," which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. it was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. i don't know if i would order it again, but i'm very glad i had it once.\u000a\u000afor dinner, i ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since i wasn't too hungry. the caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. the broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and "crouton" blended together.\u000a\u000ai ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. the gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. there were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. i'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but i ate every one in the dish. they were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. that is how sprouts should taste!\u000a\u000aeven though i didn't plan on ordering dessert, i ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. the warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. the baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.\u000a\u000ain summary, i'm glad that we gave casbah another try. i wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and i miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination.

Vdisappointing. \u000a\u000amy bf and i went for just dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. the waitress was very curt and disrespectful. we were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was not closing time). she did not offer suggestions or advice.\u000a\u000awe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. the cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. the marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\u000a\u000athe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. after we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. i am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.

Vin order of consumption...the bar is energetic, but has the worst and completely immovable bar stools ever created. we were initially placed outside in the all year round patio...absolutely no atmosphere, so we asked for a table inside...20 minutes later we were inside which had a much better vibe. i started with the blue bay mussels which were truly the best i have ever had, plump, juicy and perfectly complemented by the chorizo and white beans, absolutely sublime. my wife had the veal meatballs that were also delicious. for the entrees i had the lamb loin with couscous and my wife had the veal tortellini, although very tasty we oth agreed that both were too rich. my only criticism would be that all the entrees looked rich.

Vi have to agree with the "hit or miss" reviewers about casbah, at least when it comes to the food. i came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. they were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. and our waiter, daniel, was great. \u000a\u000athe previous reviewer who said the bloody mary is the best drink was spot-on. it had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. the mimosa and sangria were very "eh." \u000a\u000ai loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. the goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. the grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. \u000a\u000aif i lived in pittsburgh, i could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but i'm not sure i would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.

Vcasbah is more like a 3.5 but i rounded down:)  we arrived after happy hour at soba, apparently owned by the same people, for dinner.  there were four of us, and they started us out with delicious drinks.  i had the margarita topped with malbec which was surprisingly yummy. \u000afor appetizers we tried the meatballs and the grilled trip of flatbreads with mediterranean dips.  for mains, i had the rare seared tuna, andrea had the salmon, and allejandro and elie both had the gnocchi.  everything was ok to start and the mains were all good, although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction.  it was interesting to have such big portions after nyc where i'm used to portion control, but i decidedly prefer more reasonable portions (maybe somewhere in between). \u000aall in all, a nice garden, pleasant and a good place for conversation.

Vhad a very lack-luster mother's day brunch at casbah yesterday. despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. i asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. service was fine. timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. an utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but i think casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile.

Vi came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  portions are decent, and i guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \u000a\u000athe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\u000a\u000aoverall, i just wasn't very impressed with the food.  if i was offered to eat this food for free, sure, i'd take a helping, but probably not seconds.

Vrock the casbah! rock the casbah! \u000a\u000aa group of us went to the casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  it has been ages since i've been to the casbah, and since i live clear across the country, i was looking forward to going back.  \u000a\u000aall of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the jumbo lump crab chopped salad or the wild mushroom and goat cheese omelet.  both were nice portions. i was fixated on the orecchiette pasta, grilled chicken, dried cranberries, capriole goat cheese, sage cream, and it was a home run!  (i wasn't watching calories that day!)  \u000a\u000aservice was excellent . . . surprisingly so, especially with a table of eleven, a bunch of "sallies" and one "harry" if you know what i mean.

Vcasbah is the type of restaurant that i find most difficult to write about.\u000a\u000ai came here recently with my beau for a special birthday dinner, seeing as they had several vegetarian options on their menu. we booked our reservation on opentable, which i was glad to see that they actually used. i noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.\u000a\u000awe were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. i found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like casbah can have.\u000a\u000aas for the food, it was above average. nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. my boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while i got the cavatelli (also made veg). we also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much. the gnocchi and the appetizer (grilled chickpea flatbread) were by far the highlights.\u000a\u000ain the end, come here for the service and ambiance, but don't expect to have the meal of your lifetime.

Vof the big burrito group restaurants casbah is the one that has never failed us.  consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.  \u000a\u000aall of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.\u000a\u000aspecial occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop

Vmy husband and i went to casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  we were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  so much for romantic!  ever hear of a babysitter?  anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall i would give a c+.  we started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  the perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  we each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  i grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. these tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in december.  very disappointing.  i opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  it was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  another disappointment.  my husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  all this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and i their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  i might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  and we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home.

Vi finally went to casbah for brunch today. rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. because it is labor day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. we sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. i think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. it looks like they have since raised the prices since miles o. went. i felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. i ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if i wanted it). the waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. after eating these i was getting a little full and then after my appetizer i realized i probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. i ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end i don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.

Vmy fiance and i like to go to casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.  \u000a\u000athe food is great (i highly recommend the pork chop and the short rib ravioli), the drinks are wonderful (i am a sucker for good sangria - and casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable).

Vi had heard from friends that casbah was one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh, and my experience definitely lived up to the hype.  i don't know how a place owned by a company called big burrito group churns out such outstanding mediterranean fare, but i was impressed.  everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list was impressive, especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since i was dining solo.  the food (i started with grilled spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection, with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.  i'm not in pittsburgh often--too bad, it is a beautiful city--but i would visit casbah again without hesitation.

Vum.  a little bummed.  i had high expectations, but left feeling just...meh.\u000a\u000athe restaurant is really cool looking but i was a little confused by the bar set up.  we sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  i usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  if you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  \u000a\u000aalso, the service was very iffy.  there was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  the bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  i figured she was our server too.  but then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  she never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying "okay, okay, okay."  just very odd.  it continued that way the entire time.\u000a\u000ai tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (bloody mary, sangria or mimosa), appetizer and main course.  i had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of oj:), polenta and eggs beni.  the cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  i loved it!\u000a\u000athe eggs beni with smoked salmon.  it was just okay.  i kept trying to think pf what was missing and i believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  i expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  \u000a\u000ai definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe i'll have a little better luck.  so kick it up a notch casbah, you've been around for a while, but i still expect good food!

Vpassed this restaurant for years on my way to buffalo blues or more recently mad mex but have never actually eaten here.  having finally come for lunch, i overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.  \u000a\u000ai ordered the piccola gusto menu which for me included the cream of cauliflower soup, the orecchiette pasta and the roasted turkey sandwich.  it sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  for me, the size was just right.  the soup was awesome, and i could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  the pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  i did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  the perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  the roast turkey sandwich was just that.  not out of this world, but not bad.  my biggest complaint was the service.  it took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  \u000a\u000ai'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so i can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine!

Vso i hated this soba place owned by the same people, and i happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. it had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). not sure how they are owned by the same people as soba (i mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and i got a hit here, whereas i had a serious miss over at soba.  in any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  no overkill on the sauce.  the soup was likewise good.  i don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  the wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  i guess people aren't from sf and expect good wines for the same price!  save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).

Vthis review is for brunch only! i've never been here for dinner...but been here quite a few times for brunch.\u000a\u000acasbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. you get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. i usually end up spending more at my other big burrito brunch spot, kaya, so i consider this a pretty good deal.\u000a\u000athey start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. and it's refillable. try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. for appetizers, everything i've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only one thing you should order: the lamb & eggs!  crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. one of the best things i have ever eaten in the morning. the scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.\u000a\u000athis is one of the few places where i don't opt for the bloody mary...it's pretty blah. i do their salty dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if i'm really feeling the pain from saturday night.\u000a\u000aunfortunately, while i love the atmosphere, i feel like the service is lacking. i can't explain why, but it always feels awkward and doesn't hold up to the standards set at other big burrito spots (even mad mex). i know it gets busy on sundays, but still. service issues aside, the food is still worth it.

Vgreat place for a birthday party!  \u000a\u000aa family gathering!  \u000a\u000aa work retirement party!  \u000a\u000aor even a double-date!\u000a\u000aa combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! adult games!\u000a\u000athe homestead (pittsburgh) location of dave & busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from new york to florida to california - - from canada to mexico.  \u000a\u000athe dave & busters idea was conceived in little rock, arkansas back in the 1970s. two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. the two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. so they opened the first combined d & b in  . . . . no, not little rock, but dallas! to this day there are no d & b's in little rock. not sure what is up with that! but lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\u000a\u000athe one in pittsburgh is the only one i have ever been to.  when i lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for happy hour & power hour . . . . at least once a week. we had a blast!  a great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\u000a\u000awonder if they'll ever open one in marin county, ca? shucks!  probably not. not a marin county scene, for sure. \u000a\u000awhat a blast it was though! i miss going to d & b. they have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. a rechargable power card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \u000a\u000apower hour is game happy hour - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \u000a\u000aa great bar, wonderful food and service! a relaxing and fun way to spend a friday or saturday evening. you'll never want to leave. meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \u000a\u000atime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \u000a\u000adave & busters! lots of parking! lots of fun!\u000a\u000afun! fun! fun! fun! fun! fun! . . . . bring on the beer!

Vd&b is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. they are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. you feel a bit milked afterwards. also much fatter.\u000a\u000ayou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. this lets d&b give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a banana split cocktail? $3.40 for a michelob?  i have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\u000a\u000awaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\u000a\u000athe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when i last went to d&b in california. hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\u000a\u000anot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.

Vthis was actually the first time i've ever been to a dave and buster's.\u000a\u000awalking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in san francisco was strange.\u000a\u000aun-nerving actually. \u000a\u000abecause dave and buster's is all about excess. almost obscenely so.\u000a\u000aas far as food - their stuff is standard. most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. at all actually. you have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.\u000a\u000abut most people don't come to dave & buster's for food. they come for the games.\u000a\u000aand while i've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  i was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and i found myself really enjoying myself.\u000a\u000aespecially once i realized that i have mad skills at skee ball. and proceeded to dominate.\u000a\u000atrust.

Vthink chuck e. cheese for adults.  skee ball, video games pool tables.  clean environment.  good fun.\u000a\u000aunfortunately, i went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  i ended up settling for spinach dip.  sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  blahhhh.  trying to get something healthy, i ordered the apple pecan salad.  i swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  i could barely eat the salad.  too sweet.\u000a\u000amy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  the steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried again!  yowzer!  artery clogger for sure.  \u000a\u000ai like the atmosphere.  i like the bar area.  perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.

Vi love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.  the place is usually pretty clean.\u000a\u000apool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.\u000a\u000afood is just "ok" drink prices are fair but not great.

Vdave and buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \u000a\u000anext, the food. just like all the chain places at the waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \u000a\u000athe games, i swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\u000a\u000aoverall dave and buster's is unique to the waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.

Vbecause i have significantly younger sisters, i go to dave and busters about twice a year. it's fun for them and nostalgic for me. it can get expensive and the 'prizes' are cheap but it make for great "sister days" \u000a\u000aas for the food, we've eaten there once and never again. it's just blah... frozen and fried. the veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. a frozen boca patty thrown on a bun. thanks! i could have ran to costco for that. drinks are rather expensive but that's to be expected. \u000a\u000aso go for the games, fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street).

Vthe food was absolutely gross! i ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. what i got was totally different from the picture! first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! there was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat! lol no, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! gross! \u000a\u000aour waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \u000a\u000athe manager was really nice... of course that disgusting sandwich that i didn't eat was free.

Vthe usual fun center.\u000a\u000ayou can play games using a play card which you purchase there.  game prices can be confusing- - -  2.3, 5.7, 9.9 credits, etc.\u000a\u000athe arcade can be fun if you bring some friends.  \u000a\u000aalmost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choices.\u000a\u000ai didn't eat there, so i can't rate the restaurant part of dave and busters.

Vwe came here on a saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as i thought it would be. i love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) we only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. i love their new wheel of fortune game! on our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! they also have fruit ninja as a game. it was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other d&b's i've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. at this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. we didn't try the food here and instead went to p.f. chang's to eat before coming here, but the eat & play deal looked fun. too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. overall i had a blast here and definitely would come back. hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.

Va table for 16 please...   that is what i had to ask for and knew that d&b could accomodate.\u000a\u000ai happen to be in the homestead area for work.   i really wanted to dig into my yelp bag of tricks provided by local yelpers and introduce my team to the "shock and awe" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.\u000a\u000awhen i started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - the only idea i could come up with was the golden corral - i knew that was not going to work for me.\u000a\u000awe decided to do something local and walking distance - d&b was it.\u000a\u000ait is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but i had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   i was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   i am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of family guy.\u000a\u000athe waitress was very friendly and organized.    i ordered the cabo style chicken - chicken breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.\u000a\u000ait was eh...   the chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  the rice was bland.  the vegetables were cold.   i really blame it on the fact i was with 15 compatriots for lunch so i am giving it a fair rating.  everything was edible.\u000a\u000amy team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   they seemed pleased.\u000a\u000aservice - very good\u000afood - okay, not great.   my meal was $13\u000aambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in d&b\u000a\u000athere are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.  i would definitely recommend another in squirrel hill - i suggest you use yelp to find you a better one (then come back and play! ;-) )

Vdave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. there is many fun games and prizes to win. i highly suggest if you want to plays games, go wednesday when all the games are half off. food is pretty good and a nice bar. the downside is that the booze is pretty pricey.

Vwhen did dave and buster's become a daycare?? everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6pm on a saturday. i couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. ahhh!\u000ai get that dave and buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. when i last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while i'm sure we got into some shenanigans, i don't remember children running wild there. we were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. this time, it was ridiculous. it isn't chuck e. cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\u000aon top of that, the customer service sucked. the place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a saturday at 6pm, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. i suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at dave and buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\u000athe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. next, i engaged in the most rudest thing i've ever done- i began stalking tables where people were finishing up. i would walk up to people paying their check, ask if i could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and i should get in line.\u000afinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. it wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. he seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. after that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \u000ai had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. the fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. for $14, it wasn't worth it. \u000aafter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \u000aall in all, i didn't like my experience at dave and busters. i remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. if anyone asks me to go back, i may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.

Vmy friend and i both had friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on thursday night. we settled on dave and busters. i went on facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)\u000a\u000athe games weren't *quite* as fun as i remembered, but it was still a good time. the place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. when we did, the team at d&b could not have been more accommodating. to apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. \u000a\u000ai think a lot of companies (i'm looking at you, american airlines) could learn a lot from d&b. it cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.\u000a\u000adrinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my tropical mojito was awesome! my friend and i are definitely planning on going back on a wednesday for half-price games and half-price drinks.

Vdave and buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \u000a\u000adining: 2 stars\u000a\u000ai had a party of 20 coming in; i had called ahead of time, and arrived early. they immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and i waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. she did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. and then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. but they didn't tell us this; i didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until i heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. i still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \u000a\u000awhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. but, our service was rather haphazard. people would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. one person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. i know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\u000a\u000athe food is pretty standard american chain food, comparable to appleby's and chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. it has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. in the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to d&b's for games.\u000a\u000abar: 1 star\u000a\u000adrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. the problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. you have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\u000a\u000aarcade: 4 stars\u000a\u000athere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. it is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. if you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. the staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. the ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\u000a\u000a\u000aoverall: 3 stars\u000a\u000aif you want to hang out here, i would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.

Vchuckie cheese for grown ups...yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but i'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\u000a\u000afirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a dave & buster's.  second, i actually experience all of it while here.  we will start with the food/service.  staff, you were wonderful.  you were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  food, you were not wonderful.  i ordered the bbq chicken breasts.  this came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  the chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  there were actually some bites that all i could taste was charred meat.  there wasn't enough bbq sauce on the the chicken either.  the broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  also i noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  the mashed potatoes i wanted to like (which i hoped would be the best part of the dish, i'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, i was let down. *sad face* they were cold and such a tiny portion.  with a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  oh food, how if i didn't need you to survive, i wouldn't complain about you.\u000a\u000athe building right now is in disarray.  they are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  no bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  if you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\u000a\u000aspeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  with the meal i ordered i got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  the game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  the carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  one good thing is the games.  they change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  who knew that playing connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter skee ball rises to the top of my list to play.\u000a\u000ai will return again, but only after i eat elsewhere first.

Vnot really sure what to add.  so i'll bullet point my experience.\u000a\u000a- expensive poorly made drinks\u000a- friendly but slow service\u000a- ok food considering (had the philly steak and cheese)\u000a- over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision\u000a- 15% of the games were out of order (air hockey, big bball game, 1/2 of the skee ball, random other arcade machines)\u000a- expensive games\u000a- fun time overall with the wife.

Vnot being from the area, i traveled an hour to come here from uniontown, pa. i was excited! i haven't been to this dave and buster's since i was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! i went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. so, we decided to do the eat & play combo, naturally. here's where it gets bad. first of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. her name was ashley. we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. she said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. i see other people getting their food that had come in after us. i was frustrated. after waiting 45 mins for our food, i asked to speak with a manager. one of the servers who i asked replied rudely with "well, he's really busy right now. i doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you". finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. we get our food. what do you think the next problem was? yep, the food was cold. i was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed i was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. the manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. the only compensation we got were $10 game cards. woopty-doo. the only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. so, in conclusion...i do not recommend the waterfront dave and busters of homestead, pa. it was horrible, and i will not be returning for a very long time!

Vfirst time at dave & buster's and although i didn't go for the games, i was slightly disappointed. i went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks. the service was slow but the food was decent. the portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain.       \u000a\u000awe went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a friday night. i do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9.

Vdave & busters!  it's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  all ages can enjoy this place.  i was so excited to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  it made for a nice evening for adults only.  \u000a\u000aeverytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  i didn't give it four stars because every time i've went i haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  i know i still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  sometimes, i like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  i haven't as of yet, been seated there.  \u000a\u000anot to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  so all in all, d&b's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.

Vwas impressed by the new menu and new decor.   our waitress was nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  however, the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  there was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). my family and i were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   the games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  after the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. when we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight.

Vvisiting from toronto, i was really impressed! the amount of tickets to be won was incredible. we usually got 200 tickets per play on average. compared to playdium here, that's awesome considering i'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. the food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.

Vvisited the dave and busters in homestead, pa last night. waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. charged them already too - both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it was. waitress never apologized. gm was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. after spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. whatever happened to the customer is always right? horrible service

Vmy boyfriend and i are in our 20s, and have visited this d&b multiple times. after our visit yesterday, however, i don't think we'll be back. when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. at first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! the girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. we stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. it was a saturday! after we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. it took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. the floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! i had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms i used have no toilet paper in them, but there was tp all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. my boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. all i have to say is get your crap together. we could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on saturday compared to what it used to be, and i'm i have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. it's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will not be returning anytime soon!

Vehh, 3.5 -- i can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. speaking of that, i've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for d&b. \u000a\u000ai'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. however, there have been multiple instances where i swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. there have also been times that i won and no tickets were released. i guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  it's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\u000a\u000athe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. i've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. it's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. i believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  you can get the eat & play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make d&b a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  try it once i suppose. the brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. oh & whip cream)\u000a\u000adrinks- pretty weak. we ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. oh welllll. they do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. i'd go during that time for the best deal. i believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. i've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \u000a\u000athe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they "cost" however, it's cool to leave with a d&b coffee mug, cup or shot glass. last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a d&b glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a d&b coffee travel mug.. i might be missing a few odds & ends.\u000a\u000aoverall it's a fun time but can be pricey. it's best to head here wednesday for half price games or get the eat & play deal while dining. \u000a\u000ai can't lie though, i find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :d ) speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.

Vdave & busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\u000a\u000athe main squeeze and i always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) attend on a wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). we'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. and we only drink cheap drafts or drink cocktails during happy hour.\u000a\u000ayour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. if you come on a friday night, the lines will be long. you'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\u000a\u000athe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \u000a\u000anote the "drinks are weak" reviews. also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. that's typical white trash behavior. bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. all of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. i have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. this is rational, logical behavior. \u000a\u000aalso note the "prize center games suck" comments. you're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. every other visit i've seen someone walk out with a video game system (wii, xbox360 and even a few xbox one's). \u000a\u000athe thing about dave & busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. sunday afternoon it's all families and friday and saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. the atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\u000a\u000athis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\u000a\u000ausing survey receipts for buy ten get ten, avoiding wednesday, friday or saturday evenings (and sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\u000a\u000ai really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. special shout out to riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.

Vto keep it short and sweet: save yourself $100. buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \u000a\u000awhat an incredible disappointment. after seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. i understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out cold (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and i literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. it was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (not to mention, my glass was dirty, and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappointed as i was.) the service was terrible. don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \u000a\u000awas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? yes. if you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, i suppose i would advise you give it a shot. i would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.

Vi still love this place!  i spent my 36th birthday at d&b's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  i got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  i believe that service has improved, so i bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  no five stars yet, because i've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  it's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!

Vmy wife and i went here around 10pm on a saturday night. the food was not spectacular, about the same quality that you'd get at an applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  my steak was tough, but my wife enjoyed hers. staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar), and had to wait awhile for a server. food was prompt.

Vafter having a few 'less than memorable' trips to d&b in years past, my wife and i  decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday.  pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \u000a\u000aanyway- pgh hh was celebrating an anniversary and chose d&b for the location.  the d&b staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  our server, carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  the other server back there was working equally as hard but i never got the chance to get her name.  \u000a\u000ai had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit.  i think d&b is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.

Vok! let me tell you about my bad experience first. i went to d&b last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\u000a\u000ait was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. kind of counter productive if you ask me. \u000a\u000ai stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. i finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. i finally said, "are you working?" and they gave each other a weird look. i felt like i was the crazy one. i asked for a beer/got the beer.\u000a\u000ain between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. she took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. what the hell! i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established d&b. \u000a\u000ai was just really turned off from that experience. \u000a\u000athe good is that d&b provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever! we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. this place holds some really good memories for me. \u000a\u000ait's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it.

Vi used to love d&b when it first opened in the waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (fruit ninja) and 3d experience rides. with such "games", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! last time i went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. i would go to d&b to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.

Vi was here on 10/3 and i have to say this was a horrible experience.  me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  it took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  we ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  no refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  i will not be back again to eat.

Vi'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. what could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? the one thing i can think of is the price. on the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you "donate" money to the make-a-wish foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! but honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \u000ain regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times i've gone i've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (mario kart, anyone?!). either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.

Vfirst off, let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. the manager tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. this is by far the best dave and busters i've had been to!

Vmy sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. all of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. when our food came though, everything was below average. they have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. the food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.

V$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? i'm sorry, i thought i was in pittsburgh, not new york city. sing sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if i could have more than one watered down drink before i warbled my way through "paradise city" with the rest of the crowd.

Vwell, the experience did not start well. when we walked in the singing we heard was not good. oy was it not good... thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\u000a\u000aso there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. so each was on for an hour and off for half. of the 3, two were really good. good singers, good piano players, and very funny. the third guy, well, not so much. piano skills were fine. but his singing was not. when he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. often his jokes fell completely flat. luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\u000a\u000athey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (closer by nin as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). we requested britney spears' toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out really good. that takes some serious talent to pull off. if they didn't know it (like toxic) they'd find it and play it. they played a wide variety of stuff.\u000a\u000apart of the experience is based on the crowd. we had a couple larger groups (there on a thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\u000a\u000amy friends were big fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from rock bottom next door. the waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. the bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\u000a\u000aif in the waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.

Vwhile we were in pittsburgh for the winter classic on new years day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for nye. my wife and i, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up sing sing in homestead. it's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. when it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. the only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. pretty cool.\u000a\u000asing sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the rock bottom brewery and serves a selection of rbb's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. there are no tv's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. this place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to dave and busters. i'd say sing sing holds about 150 people seated.\u000a\u000athis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) nye's party. for $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. again... pretty cool.\u000a\u000athere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently i missed the sax). there was plenty of crowd involvement. as in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. the larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. i put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. their rendition of toto's africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the theme from tv's "growing pains." i was sold from that point on.\u000a\u000ai will take this time to note that this is not a family friendly joint. i'm not sure if it was 21+ only but i certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. a good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\u000a\u000adrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. i think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (rbb doesn't brew anything i particularly enjoy so i stuck with rum and cokes). all and all my bill wasn't scary and i'm not used to that on dec 31st. waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. no complaints there. \u000a\u000athe only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. it was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in homestead. understandably nye has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \u000a\u000aooops!\u000a\u000aall and all a good time and someplace i'd certainly return to if for any reason i'd be back in pittsburgh... as long as i have a car.

Vin my opinion, sing sing is really not worth it. it gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. i wasn't really into it when i first got there but as the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place. i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. but again, that's just me.\u000a\u000athe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the rock bottom brews they serve.

Vso.much.fun! \u000a\u000ai wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat. too bad i never took piano lessons and i'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. unless it's salt n' pepa's shoop. \u000a\u000athis is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. it's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a saturday night. \u000a\u000akeep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. the good thing is the food is coming from the attached rock bottom brewery. so a lot of it is restaurant quality good. plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! of course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. but you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \u000a\u000athe guys who play are incredibly talented. there's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. they pretty much play anything you ask. contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. you name it, they play it. \u000a\u000amy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. they'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. they usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, journey, of course!). \u000a\u000athe birthday song is seriously the best. they sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. but in a totally nice way of course. you just have to go!

Vdueling piano bars in pittsburgh started at station square, and they died out. then when the chain restaurant magnet "waterfront" opened in 2000 the parent company of the rock bottom breweries decided to open sing sing in back of the brewery.\u000a\u000awhen it first opened it was pretty cool. the very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. i know, i was there. from stairway to heaven to free bird, stayin' alive to she's my cherry pie, elton john to the boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\u000a\u000abut today, sing sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. the whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. i don't hate sing sing, but i could never come here more than once a year. it's a been there, done that kind of place.

Vif you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to sing sing :) if you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. if they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! they aim to please :) i have definitely been pleased :)

Vwhat a great time!  this place was awesome!  i wish i lived right down the road, because i could see myself being a regular here.\u000a\u000ahonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  they can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  did i mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  i'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \u000a\u000ai am sure i will be back in no time at all.  next time, i am bringing a big group of friends.

Vcame here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. we paid the cover, walked in and it was absolutely packed. there was nowhere to even stand. one of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in, they let us get our $7 cover back without issue. \u000a\u000ai recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. people who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. \u000a\u000athey brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. there are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. they also have mixed drinks and wine. the mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu). \u000a\u000athe entertainment was great and i would recommend it for a group outing. but definitely make sure that you have a reservation.

Vthis place has gone significantly down hill.  i've gone to sing sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  when we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  it was always packed.  however, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  i was there last saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  very slow and boring.  it appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  this was likely my last time at sing sing.  save your $7 and skip this place.  a real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.

Vpicture billy joel's "piano man" doubled mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - welcome to sing sing!  a unique musical experience found in homestead.\u000a\u000aif you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  serving food and brews from rock bottom brewery, sing sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  they'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  wanting to hear britney spears?  toto?  duran duran?  yep, they play that... new or old.\u000a\u000athe crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  if the crowd is dead, it's harder for the guys to get a reaction.  if you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a great time!  it's the perfect place for birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  the guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  for being a good sport, you get the coveted sing sing bumper sticker.  now who wouldn't want that?\u000a\u000adueling pianos and brews... time to shut up & sing sing!

Vfirst time here tonight and i must say i wasn't sure if i wanted to go. it seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but i decided to go with friends and man did i have a blast. the $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). the food was not super but good prices reasonable. the beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. i asked for something similar to yeungling but what i got was nothing like it. the musicians were great they made this place awesome. we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout

Vwent here for the first time this past weekend. needless to say i'll be returning! it was a blast!!!\u000a\u000ait was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. what is wrong with these people?! everything if you ask me! seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \u000a\u000ai had no complaints about the place itself! the guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! anddd this has to be the only place i've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \u000a\u000ai did enjoy when matt and joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! they are great at what they do. can't wait to go back!

Vmy friend is a piano teacher, so i took it as a good sign that sing sing would be quality stuff. it was her birthday, and i didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. i was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. i am really, really glad i was wrong. \u000a\u000ait was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially pittsburgh. first off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. the musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with n@ and sing sing stickers. it's obvious they've been well-loved. the music is anything but the elevator music i was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. for instance, "rubber ducky" and "gangsta's paradise" were both featured when i was there, and both performed impeccably. they also honored a request for a taylor swift song only to receive $30 and a request for "anything else," which they promptly followed. the musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like "yinz" instead of "you."\u000a\u000ai saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. they rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. i've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but i had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. they had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. he acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called joan. the other had crazy hair and bright blue chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. "i think ray charles is the most soulful guy of all time," he said when she requested him.\u000a\u000athere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the saturday night i was there. the performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. my friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\u000a\u000aluckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. the rest of the staff was friendly, however, and i stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\u000a\u000asing sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. definitely belongs on every required pittsburgh experiences list.

Valways a good time, although it's definitely not a place i would visit often. it's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \u000a\u000ashut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. they are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. also know some pretty obscure songs. \u000a\u000amy big criticism is the set up. if you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. believe me, i don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. if you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.

Vthe musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so i can't say they are all bad.  however the minimum for a song request is $5.  i spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they never played it!!  they were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  even if they didn't know the song, which i doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\u000a\u000aotherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.

Vi went here with a bachelorette party. we had reservations, which was good because it was packed that saturday night. the performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   the theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, "you bitch, you slut, you whore" and  "twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... you get the idea?  perhaps if i had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. or maybe not.

Vpretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. the show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again.

Vmy best friend took me to sing sing for my bachelor party. i had a blast. the musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. they also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). when the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected "rock bottom" restaurant for some grub. we all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\u000a\u000athere were some drawbacks though. we went on a thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. and of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. but it's not our fault the place is empty on thirsty thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. and sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. i'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when i can afford it.

Vi have said it on other sites and will repeat here. you must try their burgers. they are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. another must are the fries with guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, leek and potato soup. authentic black & tans. harp and murphys on tap. it don't get no better. this is a true gem my friends.

Vbe warned. don't expect the best service ever. it's not the cleanest place you've been in either. the decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams you've probably never heard of. it's divey, eclectic, and authentic. \u000a\u000aif you're looking for good irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the pour house. like most of carnegie's main st, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. they have some of the best irish food i've had in pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. if you're not looking for irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. it's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. i get it with a side of potato pancakes... yum. \u000a\u000aalso, they have guinness, smithwicks and harp on tap...

Vif i could give this place less than one star, i would. i have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. the decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. we went there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food. apparently, we were out of luck. i've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. he told us before we ordered that they had no "pies". no chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. so, we gamely tried to order other things. we placed our order. my wife, for example, ordered the irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. at that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that "they were out". at that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. they actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. in short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, i'd probably avoid this place like the plague. speaking of the plague, i suppose we should thank mr. surly for inspiring us to walk out. i only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.

Vbest irish food in the burgh.  great bar food too.  the service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  but, that's not what this place is about.  it's a town irish bar and it serves great solid irish fare and suds to the locals.  and it does it better than anyone.  i go back again and again.

Vokay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ riley's pour house before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting irish owners. \u000a\u000ato recap: murphy's pour house from 1979-1985. sullivan's pour house from 1995-2002. paddy's pour house from 2002-2012. and, bagpipe please, riley's pour house opens march 1 of 2012. still with me?\u000a\u000ait's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs. no more smoking allowed. hurrah!!!  same lousy service. \u000a\u000amy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. none of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. it's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \u000a\u000ai really really want this place to do better. we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \u000a\u000aget it together, murphy's ... er, i mean sullivan's....er, i mean paddy's or is it riley's? ;  ).  whatever the case, they have cold guinness. and irish music.  and fun patrons.

Vare you are really looking at the review for ljs?  its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  you will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.

Vthis would be my local haunt, if i were ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area. what a great little place! such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!\u000a \u000ait was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the steelers/ravens game. \u000a\u000athey have daily sandwich specials. on thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. very, very tasty. i'm sorry, but this place kicks primanti bros. butt on the taste factor. they have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and i can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and i was wishing we would had ordered more.\u000a\u000agoing back on a friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  wow! that buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.\u000a\u000athe other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. an older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. i really, really wanted his spam t-shirt.

Va great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. i went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it didn't disappoint. it is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - i'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \u000a\u000athe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. the other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and i wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\u000a\u000awe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. an overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (i know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, canned mushrooms - the worst thing to come out of a can. ever. i would rather eat canned alpo than canned mushrooms. and if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms i've ever consumed. the mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\u000a\u000amy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, i'll never know.

Valexion's has been around forever.  the first time i went in there, i was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  all of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and i immediately found out why.  many, many years later, i stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who i was.  the sandwiches are done pittsburgh-style, sort of like primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when i first started visiting the place.  alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree, the oldest part of the town.  i recall that some of the sandwiches i got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  nothing but good things to say about the place, and i wish it was closer to home!

Vgood for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. \u000a\u000adoesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. dont expect to have a huge selection of alcohol. \u000a\u000atheir wings are good as are their salads. if you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. \u000aoffers a quick lunch.

Vlet there be no question: alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. try a burger on italian bread. the service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. the atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in pittsburgh.

Vthe sandwiches, the wings, enough said. alexions can best be described as a home-style primantis before they went mega commercial. you really can't go wrong, but for my money, i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best i've had. that's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here i recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, reuben, or wings. \u000a\u000ayou'll know you're in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in. for someone who lives in atlanta now and only makes it to pittsburgh a few times a year, i have to say it is refreshing. feels like home. i haven't had a trip back without making it out to alexions at least once.

Vwe met a couple of friends there on a friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the yelp reviews. i've relied on yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. \u000a\u000awe ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. i tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. i've had better at almost any church that fries fish during lent. \u000a\u000aall 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. bread french fries and onion rings were good though. iced tea was good, though i've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\u000a\u000ai may give the place another try in the future for a reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)

Vthis place was delicious!!  my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebak's "25 things i like about pittsburgh" and he's usually pretty accurate.  his recommendations were to try the reuben, fish sandwich and open-faced steak sandwich.  we went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a saturday) and were seated right away.  the staff is extremely friendly.  my mom & i each had the fish sandwich, while my dad & brother had a reuben sandwich.  the fish was very good, but the reuben was to die for!  both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  on top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  the giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant reuben was $7.50.  our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  we will definitely be back!!!  oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take cash only.  so come prepared, but i'm pretty sure i saw an atm there as well.  and i do believe they are closed on sundays & mondays.

Vthis place should have a lot more reviews - but i'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\u000a\u000aits been there ages, and looks it. if you're all about ambiance, don't bother. if you pretend you're in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. the service is sometimes hit or miss. most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \u000a\u000athe food is awesome! worth any little complaints i might think up before it gets there. once its on the table, i forget them all.\u000a\u000a-fish sandwiich\u000a-salmon (huge and delicious)\u000a-flounder\u000a-shrimp a few ways ("norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and i never had it growing up in norfolk.)\u000a-hawkins st special\u000a-prime rib (sized for two, watch it)\u000a\u000athe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. i'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.

Vthis place was very good. i found out about emil's when watching a show called "25 things i love about pittsburgh" on wqed hosted by rick seback. this place ain't a luxurious restaurant...it's a beer & a shot bar / lounge. but the people are friendly & the food is good. i had the fish sandwich which was great. it ain't in a great part of town, rankin, but i've been in worse places!! try this place.

Vafter a morning of thrift store hunting, a friend and i were thinking of lunch, and he suggested emil's after he'd seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and i had not. he said they had a decent reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\u000a\u000awell, seeing as how i'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole rat pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which i can see all around me every day.\u000a\u000aand yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the holy grail. so looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\u000a\u000aso off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? at first i thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. and then...aha! here it is! and yep, there it was. this little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'emil's. \u000a\u000awe walked in the front door, and entered another world. another time, and another place. oh, and any big burrito/sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. i wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'reaaaaaalllly?'\u000a\u000athis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. and that is exactly what i love.\u000a\u000aoh...but good food counts too. \u000a\u000awe each had a reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. the reubens were decent, but not ny awesome. a little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. not too skimpy on the meat. i seriously crave a true, good ny reuben, but since i can't afford to travel right now, what i find in da burgh will have to do. but as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. those were some big thick burgers. a steak went past for the table behind us. that was huge! and when we asked about it, the waitress said 'yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' another table of five came in, and wham. fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing. yeah, i want that, that, that and that!\u000a\u000amy friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. if only i could get there on that week day before 4...\u000a\u000athe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday, and only one of her. she kept up and was very friendly. \u000a\u000athey only have pepsi products, so i had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. as the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\u000a\u000aemil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. fan-freakin-tastic! i could feel at home here.\u000a\u000ayou definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though. i am not sure that i could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it is.\u000a\u000aaddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. excellent. truly. a pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). the fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. this may have been the best fish sandwich i've yet to have in da burgh.

Vthis is a hidden gem, no really. it took us forever to find but well worth it. it is right across the street from the rankin police station. the menu has a wide selection, i really couldn't decide what i wanted but i went with the ribeye sandwich. i'm glad i did too. huge sandwich! i added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. my boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. fast and friendly service. will definitely be back.

Vordered delivery when staying at the sheraton station square.   it wasn't super fast but wasn't unreasonable (45mins) and the pizza was so good that i ended up eating way more than i intended.  not too greesey with a nice balance of cheese, sauce, dough, and toppings.

Vthey don't deliver to me anymore, moved to lawrenceville.  however, their pizza is good, not too greasy, not too dry.  nice balance with the sauce cheese and toppings.  they have awesome house rolls, i'm partial to the spinache and feta house rolls.  they are so delicious.  pretty cheap.  the delivery time is kind of long, but they are open late, and i love that.

Vmeh. i've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. keep in mind that i haven't had pizza from this place yet!\u000a\u000atheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\u000a\u000athe seafood calzone is another story. something in it was so bitter i couldn't quite eat it; i'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. whatever it was, it was gross. the shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain "i taste like iodine" flavor.\u000a\u000athe advantage to r&b is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. which would be ok if i didn't live a block away (normally i'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, yelpers, i subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).

Vthis was the first place we tried after moving to bellevue, and over a year later, we still order almost weekly.  their staff is really friendly, delivery always quick (or  at least doesn't ever take longer than the estimated time given), and food is delicious.  \u000a\u000afive stars for the staff and the food, but four stars because i wish they had better specials.

Vi stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where i would try three different pizzas in the bellevue/avalon area.  i called my order in for an xl pizza ahead of time and was told that i would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  since i only had a general idea of where it was located i ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to lincoln ave.  there isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.\u000a\u000apizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  this pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  the cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  the crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which i loved.  \u000a\u000athe bottom line for me is that i would head back to r & b's again in the future for pizza.  it was easily the most expensive of the bunch that i bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an xl but as the old adage goes "you get what you pay for" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza.

Vmy fiancée and i have made r&b's our friday night dinner tradition for over a year. the food is consistently amazing, and portions are huge. whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered, it's always less then 30 minutes - and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff? always exceedingly friendly, and happy to accommodate any special requests. sadly, we're moving out of the area in two weeks, so we won't be able to continue our tradition. but if you haven't given them a try, do it! (might i suggest the buffalo chicken sub and the cheese and bacon fries? epic!)

Vas a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), i desperately missed home-style chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. things turned around for me once i got a car (or made friends with cars), but i was seriously hurting for a while.\u000a\u000atasty was one of the places we found. back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning chinese family. they had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. if they were in nyc, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. the food was pretty good, and if you order in chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because "your parents teach you good to talk chineees". \u000a\u000ai'm pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now. the food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. it's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. the customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\u000a\u000athe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. the food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. don't expect grandma's cooking, though. order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. they have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for orient kitchen. try things, and share your thoughts.\u000a\u000atasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\u000a\u000a- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier

Vpretty solid chinese takeout.  they have a $10 minimum on campus food and delivered in less time than expected.  the szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all, but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, corn, carrots, etc.).  the vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - i don't know that i would order them again.\u000a\u000aoverall, i'm pretty pleased.  i already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says "tasty" on the storefront.   (this is how i'm going to refer to it - ie, "do you want some takeout from tasty?")  i also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice, soup & an egg roll for $2.95!  i will almost definitely order from here again.

Vfood: there are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  we've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  the general tso's tofu and the moo shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  the eggplant was soggy and not great.  the portions are large.  nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\u000a\u000aprice: tasty is cheap.  \u000a\u000adrinks: n/a\u000a\u000aatmosphere: typical chinese takeout place.  a photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  located in the plaza next to pizza parma.  decent location for that end of shadyside.\u000a\u000aservice: the employees speak poor english but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  the food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\u000a\u000a(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\u000a\u000a(-): food is nothing to write home about\u000a\u000awould i go back again? if i'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.

Vthis place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall chinese restaurant. there's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. i decided to give tasty a try because it's conveniently located on highland avenue and has easy parking.\u000a\u000ai ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon. sadly, they prepared kung pao beef instead. it's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. it's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. while it wasn't what i ordered, the food was good...but there is better chinese food out there.

Vnote: tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot\u000a\u000atasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. before i continue, i will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(as was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(i assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  however, i will chalk some of it up to my mistake because i thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. so, tasty, you get a pass on the rice\u000a\u000aanyhow, i ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(i've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). i ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. i want surface area, and i don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. i will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.\u000a\u000athe eggroll, as i said, was tough.. it tasted good, but it was tough, and small... this probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum i do need to order something else with my tofu... i hope the soup is good.\u000a\u000athe lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when i ordered. portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, i'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.

Vmy wife and i have been going here for as long as we have lived in pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  this is our go-to chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  i have never had a bad meal here, and i will forever love their beef chow fun!  my wife and i are moving to north carolina in two days, and tasty chinese was the thing about pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  these are great folks, and i wish them the best of success in the future.  remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at tasty!

Vtasty is pittsburgh's best kept secret for cantonese cuisine. if you're chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! the service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! did i mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?\u000a\u000adon't order the american standards of general tso's and moo goo gai pan , unless you really want to. this is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. \u000a\u000aif you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). and they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. the owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. if you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. they do not serve alcohol, its a byob place. the best part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  \u000a\u000amy husband and i have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  the owners are really nice and the food is great!

Vordered the lunch special with sesame bean curd + steamed rice + veggie egg roll.  the food was great, and you get a lot for $5.65.  my friend got general tso's chicken with fried rice, and she enjoyed her meal as well.\u000a\u000athe lady at the counter was very friendly and refilled our waters often during lunch.  when we were done eating, she gave us little japanese mango gummy candies on our way at the door.\u000a\u000ai would definitely come back for lunch here--it's nothing fancy, but very reasonably priced and, well, tasty. :)

Vi'm giving this place a solid 3. i've had better cheap chinese and i've had worse. first off, let me just say take out is probably the way to go. our server was nearly impossible to understand and we drank water out of tiny styrofoam cups that we had to wait for her to refill.\u000ai ordered the crab rangoon, a shrimp springroll, and chicken fried rice. the rangoon was pretty good, the springroll was just a clump of grease, and the rice was good. my friends ordered beef and broccoli, an egg roll, and general tso's. they were not too impressed with their meals.\u000aas far as food, this place seems to be pretty hit or miss. the prices make it worth ordering take out or delivery, but i wouldn't waste my time eating in here.

Vnever received my order and was left in a bad mood. the driver did not carry gps for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when i tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. \u000a\u000acannot comment about food, but whatever experience i had left a bad taste.

Vwent here last night for takeout since our normal place is currently renovating their kitchen. \u000a\u000awe ordered fried dumplings which were just ok. we also ordered some shrimp lo mein and general tsos chicken. these were some of the best entrees that i have gotten from a takeout place. the lo mein was perfectly cooked and was not greasy at all. the shrimp were also cooked perfectly. the general tsos may be some of my favorite i have ever gotten. it wasn't spicy like i requested, but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory. \u000a\u000aoverall i probably will crave the food from here and will be back, on a night when i do not mind driving to pick up.

Vmeh, i've experienced better is an understatement.\u000a\u000afriday's is like the "fine dining chain" for every yinzer in pittsburgh...\u000a\u000a1.  when we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why.  i was happy about that.\u000a2.  i ordered one of their "skinny margaritas", blackberry to be exact.  it was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\u000a3.  the waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha!\u000a4.  food came.  my burger had lettuce on it only.  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  i had to wait to ask for my pickle.\u000a5.  the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting.  disappointment.\u000a6.  the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \u000a\u000anever again will i eat at friday's.  i will, however, go should a happy hour arise...

Vhaven't been to tgifridays for years and was never really a huge fan. i get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. i must say that i was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. i had the two for $10 lunch special with french onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. i was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so i opted for the french onion. it was okay but i think that i would get a salad instead of the soup next time. the chicken strips were wonderful and i am still craving them. the portion was huge and there were leftovers. my co-workers ordered the jack daniels sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. the service was good and we had no issues. i will definitely be back.

Vif i were to describe this place in one sentence i would call it a mediocre, and cheaper version of bettis 36 on the north shore.\u000a\u000amy wife and i won a gift card in a raffle.  we went for lunch on a saturday. it was not crowded\u000a\u000awe entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way.\u000a\u000aour server took our drink order and returned promptly.  we got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger.\u000a\u000aour food arrived promptly and the appetizer was "fine".  10 years ago i would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were.\u000a\u000athe same goes for the main course. the fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.  \u000a\u000athe bill was also fair.  the meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. the server was pleasant and attentive. all in all this fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.\u000a\u000ai would return here for lunch like i did today.

Vi'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this tgi fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the "chain" expectation. \u000a\u000ai order the jack daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. the fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. the shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. even the water tasted weird.\u000a\u000afortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \u000a\u000ai'd recommend the tgi fridays out in south hills village over this one any day.

Vdining outdoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  just the right venue for that.\u000a\u000ajack daniels ribs and shrimp.  the ribs were divine.  the shrimp not quite there -- i'd say they were overdone.  \u000a\u000aour server, ed, was very attentive.  i asked for celery in my bloody mary.  not only did it come with a celery stalk in it, he brought over more celery.  yummmm....

Vwent with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. the server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. maybe they were short handed.  the food was to me not even average. i ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  my friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalapeño slice on each piece. imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  not like any nachos i've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.

Vone of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends. good place to chill, eat, drink and watch the game, and maybe some pool afterwards. the food is not bad, they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget. "dollar burger night" where you build your own burger is fun, but the patties can be dry sometimes, so remember to get them sauced. iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have, the wings arent as good as you would like, i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water. but overall its a nice place to go because it's cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well.

Vi stopped here yesterday with rob and matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing "the hangover" at loews across the street.  incidentally, "the hangover" is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  there are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  it's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  we sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  i ordered a guinness as usual, rob ordered a long island iced tea and matt had a miller light.  make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  i sampled rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  the next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  the bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  i don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  we ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  we started with the chips and salsa.  the chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  i tried one it was okay i guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  he asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  this pretty much sums up my experiences at the bar louie's i've been too.  they kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  maybe i'm being too critical... i tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... so, i settled on the hummus appetizer.  this was surprisingly pretty good.  the pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  it's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  matt had the hot wings which i tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  all in all this place isn't that bad.  if you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.

Vdon't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard, cinnamon butter, and a spicy queso dip. the queso is my favorite but they were all delish. i also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 m-f is 1/2 off appetizers so i was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. the menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. we didn't get drinks but some looked good...

Van absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. however, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. no gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.\u000a\u000aanyway, the small plates made for good "upscale" bar food. half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. however, i would not buy a full-priced dinner here. nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. the baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.\u000a\u000abe warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.

Vthe pros: great view of the city and river in good weather...  \u000alovely for loud large groups\u000avaried menu with some original items\u000agreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\u000afun location\u000agood place to take out of towners.\u000a\u000athe cons: the food when i went yesterday was not great.  we got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn't as described because the kitchen was out of "lots of things"  (tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  \u000acan be loud--not a place for a romantic date...\u000athe bathroom condition was really bad.\u000a\u000athe server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. \u000a\u000athe view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to "pour some sugar on me"  seriously?!?!?  yes!   classy eh?

Vwent there on saturday night following a movie at loews.  we sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs.   ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas.   the calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark.   it wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey.   the menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.   miller lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites.  \u000a\u000agreat atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game.\u000afood looks like its hit or miss\u000a\u000aall in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie.

Vthe words "epic fail" get thrown around a lot these days....but i really feel like they apply in this situation.\u000a\u000awe went on friday, april 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  it was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\u000a\u000athe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  we placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\u000a\u000aby 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  we just wanted to leave.\u000a\u000ainstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  uhhhh yeah.  thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   we finally were able to leave around 7:30.\u000a\u000abar louie:  you are dead to me.

Vi had the exact same experience as john r. went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. the place was near empty and there were three waitresses. got seated and waited on immediately. ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. this should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\u000a\u000a20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. she said our food would be out in a few minutes. another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. we flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. she finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. she says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). after speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she "definitely" put our order in so it "must have been given to someone else by mistake." because they wouldn't have noticed that that wasn't what they ordered? seriously?\u000a\u000athe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. all that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. how generous! we shovelled what we could into our mouths, did not leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that john had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. worst part? i opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. of course.\u000a\u000ahowever, i gave this place two stars instead of one. that's because my food, when i finally got it, was perfect. i had the greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how i like it, with delicious toppings. i really wish i could come back here for the food but...hell no.

Vservice has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\u000a\u000athings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good i could eat it with a spoon)

Vlet me just say that this used to be a place i loved.\u000a\u000aremember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. to me, that is bar louie\u000a\u000ai can't say the food is bad. i had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. i will say i still ate them so shame on me. my  sandwich (the mario) as always was very good.\u000a\u000anow here comes the bad:\u000a\u000a1. there were fruit flies everywhere. i felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. at one point i had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. i understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\u000a\u000a2. the place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. the girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\u000a\u000a3. because of number two our service in general was not good. i can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. i mean. i've played diner dash on my ipad, i know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\u000a\u000ait's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. i think i'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because i used to love it so much i can't rate it that low. part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.

Vwe were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. the 2 of us got to bar louie at 8:30.  we sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  i tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  finally the waiter took our order.  1 sam adams light bottle, and one pineapple juice+vodka.  after about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager i don't know) asked if we had been waited on. we said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  he left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. my date was given vodka on the rocks. and i was given a sam adams.. \u000athey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. we told them to bring another round and the check.  it was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\u000a\u000aby this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and i gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\u000a\u000afor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka i was charged $31.03. i didn't have time to complain or ask. i won't be going back.

Valthough i wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that i enjoy having a meal at, when i am in the homestead water front. on all of my visits here i have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. the dipping sauce are to die for.  i've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. \u000a\u000athe first time i ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. so this resturant has sentimental value to me. i attach eating here to having a special night out in the waterfront. \u000a\u000abar louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food, that is.

Vwhen the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\u000a\u000anothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. i came here on saturday ay 6pm. almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes i was there i counted 9 waitress again i counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. just from the looks of it i could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. so after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.

Vi was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around. all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drinks and appetizers.\u000a\u000ai am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired.\u000a\u000athis is probably the first place i've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. to me, that is beyond ridiculous. bar louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \u000a\u000aas i mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. i really wanted to like this place because of things i had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, i'll go somewhere that i can get good service.

Vi came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. unfortunately, i cannot because the service was so bad that i left before i had the chance to order. we found seats at the bar behind the taps. after sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. it was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and i'm sure they face much busier times. we sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (i timed it - i am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.

Vwent here for drinks and nachos and it is a very nice establishment.  the nachos were very good the drinks pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place.  there are fire places outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs.  go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumbs up.

Vhaha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha.

Vit was the first time that i went to this location.  we sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  i had the bbq burger with fries.  for the price of the burger i expected something much better.  it was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  as a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  in addition, their drinks are expensive!  just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  there are enough restaurants at the waterfront that i don't know that i will come back here.

Vi personally enjoyed my recent visit to bar louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. the restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\u000a\u000aso why does bar louie get 3 stars? happy hour and a nice patio!\u000a\u000ahappy hour is on monday-friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 drafts, $4 wines, $5 martinis, and 1/2 price select appetizers and flatbreads. my friend and i ordered 4 martinis and 3 appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. not bad!\u000a\u000ai ordered a strawberry peach bellini and a s'mores martini, and both were tasty. we shared bruschetta pomodoro, spinach & artichoke dip, and roasted vegetable flatbread. the food was also good, and i would order all three items again in the future.\u000a\u000amy recommendation is to understand what bar louie is good at (happy hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!

Vthis is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. friends and i went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). they claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. when we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. we ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \u000a\u000ai only had appetizers here so i can't really judge them for their entrées, but i will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  i got the spinach artichoke dip. it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. for a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. i don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...i felt like i was chewing grass. \u000a\u000aoverall, i would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. food was way too average for the high price.

Vthis place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. as a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. the couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after our appetizers were being cleared off. \u000a\u000athe food was pretty good, but because of the service i won't be returning.

Vas far as chain restaurants go, bar louie is ok. i really like their appetizers and their salads, but i don't care for their burgers or pastas. their drinks are ok. they're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., applebees.\u000a\u000aservice is hit or miss. last time i went, i had just fine service. the time before that was also just fine. sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (once, i went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. i had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. i still don't think he believed me. it would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). \u000a\u000athings i like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. things i dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.\u000a\u000agreat to stop in right before a movie at loews, though! :-)

Vi must say, my experience last night at bar louie was wonderful. i was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here, but my husband convinced me to give it a try. \u000athe place is seat yourself and it's loud in there. i was a little underwhelmed by that at first but i got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.\u000aour service was fantastic. courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... and the place was packed.\u000athe drinks were perfect, just strong enough. we tried the peach lighting and the tiki drink. i liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. there were real berries mixed into that one. yum.\u000aon to the food... my turkey/ham/brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. the highlight of the meal though was the whiskey cake. sonnet-worthy.\u000awe'll definitely go back again.

Vmeh, i just don't see the appeal bar louis has to pittsburghers. i guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift. it's always packed. being so close to the amc theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \u000a\u000ait's expensive, the food is so so. before i get ahead of myself, i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken. the bbq ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. it's equal parts ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \u000a\u000atuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. skip it. one caveat for this location, free parking. at station square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\u000a\u000ai'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when burgatory opens across the street.

Vi am normally a bar louie fan - my husband and i love the one in tampa.  this location needs a lot of work.  we went on a friday evening before a show at the improv.  we were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  we never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  we got there at about 6:40/6:45 so happy hour was wrapping up, but i would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  there were also plenty of empty tables.  this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  but we grabbed a table.  i am not a clock watcher, so i am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  then we got our drinks at 7:04.  the only reason that i know is because i was looking at my phone because my husband and i wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of happy hour.  that went out the window.  when our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  we finished them and left.  the server was nice, that is not the issue.  the issue was how grossly understaffed they were.  they had two bartenders on (i think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  the server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with "this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped".  that is a sign that you need more staff.  i have never had this happen at any other bar before.  get more staff.  we ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get hh pricing.  even though, in my opinion, they should have honored hh pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  we ended up going to the improv and got food there.  bar louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.

Vwe stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. our server, was friendly. my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\u000aboth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  after i finished my drink, i used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! ugg! did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! she comped the drink but we won't be back.\u000acan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.

Vi can't even review this place. we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. and i have to be clear it was a saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and i saw 3 waitress walking around. i think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.

Vman, haters gonna hate.  listen, y'all, bar louie isn't fancy.  it's just not and their extensive martini list won't fool me.  however, the food is good ole american bar grub and their beer selection is decent.  the staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers.  as long as bar louie still keeps having $1 burger days (tuesdays) and $1 beer days (wednesdays), i will continue to be a fan.  fyi, it's a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot.

Veh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a saturday night.\u000a\u000abobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. when we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. it wasn't all that busy, either. most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. it seems that bar louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. maybe i'm just salty about the wait.

Vi rather like bar louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie.  been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.\u000a\u000athe two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.\u000a\u000ai would highly recommend the bruschetta pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone).

Vi don't frequent bar louie, and i really don't plan to change that any time soon. i've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and i just haven't been super impressed by the place.\u000a\u000athe food has been decent - a few years back i splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that i am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never "wowed" me. and while i enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that i think most of the drinks i personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. once i stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. not even a large one, either! sorry, but i find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\u000a\u000astill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind if i could hear myself think when i eat here. but good lord, they're just so loud! i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. not cool, bar louie. not cool.\u000a\u000aso while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the waterfront i don't expect to be back in any time soon.

Vmy sons a and i came for tuesday dollar burger night. you can gat a "burger" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, artery cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. you can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. \u000amy burger was $2.25 after i added toppings. is it the best burger i've ever had? no. but is it the best $2.25 burger i've ever had?  yes. it's kind if a russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. we probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink. \u000ai love the tater tots!  they are crispy and have the right amount of salt. yummy!!\u000aour server was great and we'll definitely be back.

Vgreat atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. the service is always friendly, even if they are busy. i enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. i highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. \u000a\u000abe sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!

Vrock bottom brewery in homestead is always a good time.  they brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  saturday night c and i stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \u000a\u000aour first issue of the night was getting to rock bottom.  as the restaurant is located in homestead, a trip across the hi level bridge was in order.  little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  this place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  after we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\u000a\u000athe food at rock bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  they also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\u000a\u000aour order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including chicken nachos, quesadillas and ball park pretzels.  we had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \u000a\u000athe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  in much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  with shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  the ball park pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  they are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\u000a\u000aas far as the beers are concerned, i ordered up the sampler so that i could get a taste of the various brews.  they make a wide assortment of brews, from the bud lightesque "lumpy dog" to a dark "brew masters choice."  i found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  i would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the rock bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but i would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\u000a\u000ai give it 3 out of 5 rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.

Vsummary:\u000aif i was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, i might come back for beer and appetizers.\u000a\u000agood:\u000a- decent beer...\u000a- original pretzel appetizer.  you take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\u000a- huge portions.  most of us had leftovers.  the rb appetizer sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  the half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\u000a- attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\u000a- amusing name.\u000a\u000abad:\u000a- lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  i guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\u000a- none of the food was super awesome.  nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  i've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\u000a- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\u000a\u000acome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.

Vi am a big fan of rock bottom.\u000athere are several dishes that are money.\u000aappetizer:  seared ahi, spinach artichoke dip\u000aentree :      fire steak, pub tips or chicken fried chicken.\u000adesert :      carrot cake (to die for)\u000abar food:     pizza or ball park pretzels.  both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  \u000ahalf the menu is really good, the other half is great.  \u000athe beer is good.  ask for the sampler!  they usually have a velvet and something on cask.  ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  they will also have a scotch ale, an ipa, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still matt, the mood is grumpy).   if andy is still working there, he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail area.\u000ahead over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrap.\u000ai used to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can.\u000adon't go to the one in charlotte though, its not really a rock bottom.

Vi thought this place was pretty decent. my friend and i were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads... and they were huge. and tasty. i liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing. my friend's was even more slathered so she didn't dig it too much. we'd also ordered chips with guacamole, the guac was pretty good. my friend enjoyed her beer. i enjoyed my coke (i know, i'm lame).\u000a\u000aso yeah... wasn't bad, wasnt the best, but it was okay.

Vmicrobrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer i would have drank otherwise.  one waitress i had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as "kind of like coors light".  if i wanted coors, i'll pay half as much and have one.  \u000a\u000athe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  head next door to sing sing for drinks, though.

Veverytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and i've never been dissappointed.  i sit in the bar, grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos.  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens.  rock bottom is a chain but it's one of the better chains in the area.  i'll pass on chili's or friday's and come to rock bottom instead.  oh and typically i walk over to target - work off some of those nachos.

Vnobody has reviewed this in a while, but i am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  my husband and i ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.\u000a\u000awe started with drinks--he got the house-brewed portland wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and i got a mixed drink (red rock) that was also tasty.  \u000a\u000ahe got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and i got a mahi sandwich.  both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  there were tons of things on the menu that i'm looking forward to trying.\u000a\u000awe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\u000a\u000aour food and service was great.  they had the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  seriously, what's not to like!?  i'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)

Vthis is literally the first place i went when i first came to pittsburgh - and i loved it. hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. although, for the sake of full disclosure, i didn't sit at the bar and i don't drink alcohol so i can't comment on that. i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. really, i have no complaints about this place so i'm surprised by the few low ratings here.

Vlittle slow on the service and didn't have the beer i wanted on the menu. but you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   but the stadium pretzels are good.  the cream stout is tasty.\u000a\u000athe burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  i'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)

Vlately, the rock bottom is hit or miss. the beers are always good and the uppity jagoff ipa is one of the best india pale ales i've ever tasted. the low point lately has been the food. i will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. that said, i ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. the filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom.

Vfirst off, i will say that i just moved here from california and was a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach. i came to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\u000a\u000anow, rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and i am fine with that). i have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so i am fine with that. the food here was just as good as the long beach location, so i have no problem with the chef at all.\u000a\u000aservice was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. i wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and i got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned i had just moved here... i really enjoyed that.\u000a\u000abeer: we got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... i found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. the light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. the pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. the uppity ipa was very good... i don't usually like ipas because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. still, couldn't do a whole glass. i felt the imperial stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... i almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). the brown and amber were decent, but bland. i ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on long beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\u000a\u000ai really wanted to try the das gut dopplebock, but they were out. looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so i hope i can catch that. also want to try the snow moon belgian.\u000a\u000averdict: while i was not too impressed with the dark beers, i found the lighter ones very good and i look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. it is a good hour drive south to get there, so i won't be going too often, but i will be back.

Veven since rock bottom opened (7 years ago???) i have always thought it was a dance club.  i am not really sure why but i thought it was along the same line as (throw back) hi-tops but i did. i think i always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. \u000a\u000awell i was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the improv and rock bottom was close. \u000a\u000apart of this is my fault...i always order "healthy" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then i am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  \u000a\u000ai started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. i nursed it all through dinner so i don't think i was head over heels in love with it.  i got the catch of the day, off the hook, fish dish, sailors delight or something(i forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  it was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  the fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. the rice and asparagus were great though. \u000a\u000amy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  the fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  they were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\u000a\u000apros: a lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\u000a\u000acons: place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  i know some people love to eat food like this all the time( i do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (i would love to but its just not in my cards). i do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.

Vwent with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  we ordered a few appetizers first.  the wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\u000a\u000athe brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.

Vhere's the trick to enjoying a meal at rock bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  stick with the sandwiches, salads, burgers, and bar food; and you'll be ok.  i've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  also, i've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  join the mug club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  thursdays are trivia nights and the dj is playing the music loud, so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :)

Vbeer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. the bourbanzola was a good addition. defiantly a place i would go again. joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly.

Vrock bottom is a nice hangout place. often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. \u000a\u000a\u000adepending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. it's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. the bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. when the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. the view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the improv. which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! \u000a\u000a\u000athe bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. on any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen tvs surrounding the bar area. \u000a\u000athe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. they have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. the bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a bourbon based glaze and gorgonzola cheese. appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \u000a\u000aon monday the burgers are half off...i don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. however, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials. \u000a\u000ahttp://www.rockbottom.com/mc \u000a\u000aneedless to say i have a fun beer glass collection thanks to rock bottom...lol! \u000a\u000anow everyone favorite part about rock bottom's beers! \u000athe in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of ale, ipa's, rotating darks and kolsch. \u000a\u000astop by on thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!

Vwe've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. then, once you finally do, you realize how many opportunities you wasted!\u000a\u000arock bottom is definitely a solid bar. as a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. there are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. \u000a\u000awhat really makes rock bottom standout, though, is the food. my girlfriend and i shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. they also make a mean soft pretzel. \u000a\u000athe waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh, but no trip to the waterfront, is complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom.

Vi would have to say i'm pretty partial to rock bottom, i have been going almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic "team trivia". my friends and i love the atmosphere, the dj (todd), and the service that we get at rock bottom. \u000a\u000aevery week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! \u000a\u000aas an avid rock bottomer, hands down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom. whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. it is a meal itself! the mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! \u000a\u000aanother favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. \u000a\u000athe service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. \u000a\u000aa truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! \u000a\u000acome to team trivia every thursday at 8pm!

Vrock bottom on thursday nights is the place to be. team trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. the dj (todd) is great. \u000a\u000athe food is good, but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip is the best. the wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. i am not a beer drinking so i haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks i've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. \u000a\u000aon nights that are not trivia nights, rock bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. larger parties will usually be split into two tables. \u000a\u000aoverall, an enjoyable place at which i am a regular.

Vso i have not been to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since i was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place i went along. \u000a\u000afirst surprise: decent beer.  i remembered the normal rb brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial ipa that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expected.  recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. \u000a\u000aservice was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. i'll be back next time i'm in pittsburgh for work.

Vthe beer is good. their light beer, lumpy dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. when i was pregnant i became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\u000a\u000aas others have noted, the pretzels are really good. i'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. long, long ago, when i used to go to the rock bottom in boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star!

Vi always feel like i am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, i feel the bar is raised for places like this. it seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category. let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. if it was only about the beer, i'd go buy a growler and take it home. \u000a\u000aso, about the beer....excellent!!!!! the jagoff ipa is with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever had! they only i can think of that i think is better is dogfish head, but that's a matter of opinion. the beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. you can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \u000a\u000aas for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. my biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. one time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \u000a\u000athat's pretty much it. this place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. till then, it's hit or miss!

Vi was so ready to like this place!  turns out, not so much.  it was okay.  no better than tgifridays, but better than eat n park!  the deets.\u000a\u000athe hubster and i were here on a saturday evening after a show at the improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  we ordered drinks.  he a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave bloody mary with absolut peppar.  the hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he did order another one "just to be sure."  my bloody sucked.  watered down tomato juice with no discernible peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  even a good standard mix would have been better.  our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  nope, no better at all.  that went back and i went with a you-can't-screw-it-up amaretto sour.  it was fine.\u000a\u000ahub ordered a reuben - why, i'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented gazebo in shadyside.  you younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which i speak.  he said this one was "fine."  i had the texas fire steak with jalapeno butter which i enjoyed very much!  packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  steamed veggies.  any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  no way!\u000a\u000athe tab was reasonable - we did have a living social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  not bad (even with the $15 cost of the ls deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  we'll hit the improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.

Vi must admit, i do like the brews.  i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  other than that, meh.  the food is pretty forgettable.  another "brewery" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  with the restaurants upping the ante on 8th ave, you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom.  but how would anyone know to?  it's a chain.  whomp whomp!

Vfor a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to germany. not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.

Vi've always been pleasantly surprised with the food i've gotten at rock bottom.  i say "surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a "chain", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  but i've really had a lot of good meals at rock bottom.  now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a "bar-straunt" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  for instance, i will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  i'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the mon doesn't count.....).\u000a\u000abut besides that, i always really enjoy my meal choices.  i've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  i've also ordered the margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  it's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  the pizza was really great.  the crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  and not greasy whatsoever - big bonus points there.  but my biggest surprise as of late was when i ordered their chicken flautas.  i'm a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  but i had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  it was delicious.  the flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  the accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  i was so happy!\u000a\u000ai've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  i go on thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  the ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed trivia night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\u000a\u000ai definitely give rock bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.

Vi went to rock bottom this past weekend, and it was "nice" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. while the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\u000a\u000ait was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. if we hadn't really wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv, we would've just left. it definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so i can't overlook it. of course, the service has always been spotty at rock bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\u000a\u000acombine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.

Vthe only reason rock bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. food was "eh", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. this place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas.

Vrock bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  as expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  the beers are better than church brew works and the bar was populated.  the bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \u000ai vote for rock bottom as the anchor store of the water works.

Vi haven't been to rock bottom in years.  maybe even decades...is that even possible?  well, either way, it's been awhile.  so with my gift certificate i took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \u000a\u000aas i get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  as a result, i told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  plus the pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\u000a\u000awhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  we loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, "i have to go back for the rest."  in all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - i can never tell).  i gotta say, rock bottom knows their beer.  i liked more than i didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  so the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \u000a\u000aduring our sampling we indulged on some southwest egg rolls.  they were okay, but not quite what i expected.  the spicy ranch was top notch, though.  as we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a kobe burger.  they were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  and to top off our wonderful evening, the pirates brought home a win!\u000a\u000amy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  the glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  that's the empty price.  to me, that's a little ridiculous when east end only charges $3 for the bottle and penn brewery $5.  paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  so i walked out empty handed.    but it won't deter me from returning.

Vi just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer, and i have to admit that i was pretty satisfied with what we got.  though i couldn't find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section, there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot.  the atmosphere of this seems pretty cool, especially in the pub area.

Vi very much enjoyed my first visit here. i got the turkey meatloaf and it was really tasty. it's more sausage than turkey. the cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. the star of the night was the appetizer, the artichoke and crab dip. it was awesome. my only complaint was i ordered a red ale and they were out. i had the curmudgeon instead and it was very good, but still.

Vwent to rock bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. my coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. the waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. if you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from chili's - the filling tasted like that and i am a big fan! \u000a\u000amondays are half off burger days and i tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. it was delish! the ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \u000a\u000athe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday, it's totally worth it. i think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \u000a\u000ai felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. the service was quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour.

Vrock bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just "ok".  the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. they have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \u000a\u000atheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. i have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\u000a\u000ai feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chili's of brew pubs. if you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the burgatory opens!

Vwent here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise i'd be fine giving this place a 3.\u000a\u000aour waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - i had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and i'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\u000a\u000ahere's where i ran into problems. i'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when i asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \u000a\u000aadditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\u000a \u000aon a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; i've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\u000a\u000afinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. i was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.

Vnothing special. just like applebee's, chili's or fridays. stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \u000a\u000athis was our second attempt at trying rock bottom on fathers day. the first time almost ten years ago. we went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. how do you do that on fathers day?! this time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\u000a\u000amy wife got and loved the berry bash sangria. she just said it had too much ice in it. our daughter got the root beer float which she love and i started with a mango ice tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\u000a\u000awe started off the the kobe beef sliders as our app. it took at least 15 minutes to get them. you get three sliders and they were very good.\u000a\u000amy wife got a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. she complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\u000a\u000aour daughter got the kids burger and fries. no surprise there.\u000a\u000ai ordered the new york strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. my strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. the green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \u000a\u000athe kitchen sounded like an live episode of hell's kitchen. the waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. the kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\u000a\u000aon a different note, our waitress susan was very good. come here for drinks and the bar food. skip everything else.

Vi go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so i was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  my maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  my moh and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  my shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  it started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  the only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  there was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  it would have just gone to waste!\u000a\u000aalso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!

Vi rarely give a business a superior rating, but i have to say my wife and i had one of the best dining experiences at the rock bottom brewery.   the food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  the staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \u000a\u000aplease support this business.  i guarantee you will not be disappointed.

Vi'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   the food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  the menu has a good variety, and everything i've tried has been good.  portions are large.  \u000a\u000aone side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several tv's & 2 pool tables.  it's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  the other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  in general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  i've always had quick & friendly service.  \u000a\u000ai love the whole waterfront area....so much to do!

Vi'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so i agreed to tag along.  i'm glad i did!  our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one i would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  the food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  my burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  the waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  my only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and i spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  not sure i would make the hour+ trip to pittsburgh again, but if i found myself in the city, i may just stop by.

Vcame with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip. it was very greasy and had virtually no crab. the wedge salad was good and crisp. i had the hazelnut crusted chicken. this has to be one of the worst dishes i've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.

Vtom and i decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a saturday night. he is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\u000a\u000awe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. we put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. about 25 minutes later, our table was ready. parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with dave & busters and a karaoke bar called sing sing. tom dropped me off at the door so i could secure our table.\u000a\u000aour server, jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. she was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. tom ordered a red ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. jackie gave tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. he loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. jackie switched the red ale to the beer of tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. very nice of her!\u000a\u000awe started out with the ball park pretzels with jalapeno dip. the pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! we only ate one and took the other to go. very good app though! \u000a\u000atom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and i got the chicken fried chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. not very good presentation at all. the food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. the potatoes were my favorite part. tom said that his burger was mediocre.\u000a\u000aanother note: the bathrooms are shared with the sing sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... yuck.\u000a\u000aoverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. and definitely not to use the bathroom...

Vi'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. their nachos is pretty good. i also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. \u000ai think the only thing i did't like is the steak taco appetizer. it was too sour and kinda tasteless.

Vso after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the waterfront, we headed to rock bottom for some late night grub.  the place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  as nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \u000a\u000aso finally seated i look over the drinks and being the huge ipa lover that i am i went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  the hubby had the red ale which was also rather good.\u000a\u000athe service was ok, not the best not the worst.  but moving on to more important thing, the food.  talk about missing the mark hugely!  i ordered the mini street fish tacos.  you get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  they were just strokes away from inedible.  i love fish tacos, i mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? the shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when i picked them up.  the sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  if i wasn't so hungry i wouldn't have eaten them at all! lesson learn on that.\u000a\u000athe husband had the bbq chicken pizza.  it had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  my husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  for instance, he would usually just say, chicken bbq and cheese, nothing else!  i refused to let him do that this time, because i was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  and boy was i jealous when it came out.  it blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  should have stuck with something simple.  \u000a\u000afurthermore i could care less if i come back to this location.  the beers were good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore.  and the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  i know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...

Vanother good meal ... this time the housemade meatloaf. it's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. a refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. the server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. service was prompt just the same. overall good experience.

Vi have to say that i've only been here when it was very busy. i found the service fairly quick and any of the food i've had has been delicious. i went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. without going into detail, i will say they handled it wonderfully. our waitress mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. i had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. i had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. i would go back again!

Vmy husband and i got here a couple times a year.    always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   i love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken mac and cheese.   recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.

Vpoor service and food. i waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. they finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... so i had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. yes, i had to try and give them money.\u000a\u000aon to the important part... food was terrible. i had a burger and it was pathetic.

Vi love this restaraunt. rarely have i ever received service like i get here. the food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. the thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked to temperature. this rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. but the servers are fantastic. very attentive, polite and timely. the beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. i like having lots of options as far as beverages go. the wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night. and they most often call you before the quotes time. the desert menu is a little small, but i could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. they also have outside seating available when the weather is nice i highly recommend this establishment!

Vgood food and large portions. i ordered the veggie burger for $8.50 and i loved it! it's one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. the chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. my burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. as for drinks, i'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, i could tell it was very good quality beer. bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. i rarely drink beer but i i'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\u000a\u000anote: there aren't too many options for vegetarians. the veggie burger was pretty good and i'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.

Vi've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so i do eat here once in a while. we stopped in last night and i had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. the food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. the ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. \u000a\u000amy friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. it looked delicious and the portion was huge. i'll be trying this dish next time we're there. \u000a\u000awe've also had the ball park pretzels in the past, and they're really good. \u000a\u000ai'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the berry bash sangria was delicious (if expensive). we'll be back.

Vevery time i've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. my go to is the laredo burger and the mac n'cheese as a side. they mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! i've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. the beers on tap are always great. my newest favorite is the first! pumpkin ale. \u000a\u000aone thing i really appreciate about rock bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. the food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. i was just at rock bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. we got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to walk over to the cinemas. it was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\u000a\u000amy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. i also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom is a small chain. \u000a\u000aoverall i definitely recommend eating here if you're in the waterfront!

Vthe food is standard american fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  the kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  the service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  i've been to the one at the denver airport as well, but i was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from rock bottom it was.  since it's a recognizable national chain, i think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craft-brew experience.

Vthe beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at all. i've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a "foodie" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. if you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy rockbottom. the only entree i did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. otherwise, you are better off skipping it.

Vthis place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. we decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many tv's. they also have darts and two pool tables, which i really enjoy. when you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. \u000a\u000ai ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by rock bottom. they both tasted delicious and were exactly what i needed for a hot day. my friend ordered the fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. it was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which i am not really a fan of. i ordered the sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. the salad was okay i was expecting more flavors overall, but i didn't really get them. \u000a\u000ait was a good experience and will most likely be back when i am around the waterfront area.

Vi am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowing break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. the one chain that i can't break from is rock bottom. \u000a\u000atheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, i really love their white ale. their seasonal ipas have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around christmas) and their smoky bbq brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented bbq amazingly ; they had it this past summer, i bought a growler of it lol). \u000a\u000aas far as their food goes, i typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. i've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \u000a\u000aalmost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich. it's my favorite chicken sandwich! so good. the chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and i love the charred flavor that it has. the bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... there's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. mhm! i love it. my boyfriend usually gets the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \u000a\u000aanother item i always get... their apple coleslaw. i've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. so simple, yet oh so good. \u000a\u000athey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \u000a\u000atheir side salads are awesome as well. they are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which i give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. yum! \u000a\u000ai usually order the same thing every time i go. i steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. which turned me off to trying new items there. plus i am just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. \u000a\u000aservice is always great, the bartenders are friendly... i love this place. ask about their rock bottom rewards !

Vbe careful. the servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. i want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly mark who seems to let his staff run around.

Vi always enjoy rock bottom. standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \u000a\u000ai prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \u000a\u000anachos, nachos, nachos. truly the best in the area. great burgers, chili and salads. really...i don't think i've had a bad meal here. nice outdoor seating in the summer. \u000a\u000athis is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  i know they have other cocktails here, but i can't order them at a beer place. i've seen them and they do look good, but i'm stuck to the beer selection. \u000a\u000athey have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \u000a\u000aservice is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.

Vthis is  a "okay" place to eat.  the food is nothing special.  i guess what they have going for them is the beer.  order the  guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  rice (cajun taco) was not cooked well.  would i go there again "maybe".  if your into beer and watching the game, then yeah go there.

Vball park pretzel-would eat again. \u000a\u000ai came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. i then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. i saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. i noticed a ball park pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. i was blown away, the fact that i got 2 pretzels amazed me. i ordered within 25 minutes of seating. my pretzels hit the table within minutes. the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. but i knew we could step this shit up, i asked for mustard. and what do you know. grey poupon dijon mustard is in front of my eyes. i combined that shit and life evolved. i went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because i took a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence. good look rock bottom, keep up the good work.

V3.5 rounding down. its been a while since jb and i ate here and i would consider going back but we just haven't gotten around to it. the beer selection looked great but the first 3 beers that i wanted "hadn't come in yet" (they were in the middle of expanding their offerings, this really bothers me...if you don't have the product, don't put it on the menu).\u000a\u000aits not necessarily vegetarian friendly, i got a pizza and it was good, not fantastic, only good. justin was satisfied with his meal. its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way.

Vwe're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the waterfront (they do exist...), and this has become a favorite. i've had the hot roast beef & fries and the corned beef on rye, and both were delicious. every beer i've had here has been ice cold, and the service has been strong too. it's a great place to watch a pirates game too.

Vstopped by on a mon evening after trying to dine at smoke taqueria which is closed mondays. parking on street in front or behind off hay st. super friendly bartender. in warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. bet it's a fun place in warmer months.

Vthere's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  we were there on a pens playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  our orders were somewhat mixed up.  the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  i tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  the crust was delicious and homemade.  if you are going to order something, i would go with the pizza.  we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  if you are looking for good food, homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front.

Vbefore today i probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. we waited two hours for a pizza sub, french onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. about an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). we were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. she sent it back. by a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the french onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  we were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. no quick and easy app or beers on the house. to boot, the beer was pretty expensive. i will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. the food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. we ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.

Vi'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. i've only gone to duke's one time, but the food was good. it wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\u000a\u000athe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. we sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. the dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \u000a\u000ai'll definitely be back since i live in the area.

Vduke...the owner...is the man.  he's a true pittsburgher and he loves everyone from pittsburgh.  he looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  he's also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next door...i believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  very relaxing atmosphere.  i wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.

Vi've been to duke's three times now. when i first came to pgh, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\u000a\u000athey have an excellent new tap system. last time i went, they had thirsty dog leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. the system really elevates already awesome beer. plus, the selection is awesome. \u000a\u000ait is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud tv's and plenty of yelling. i'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although i do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. service is often slow, and they give the waitresses zero training in the beers that they offer. this is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \u000a\u000athe biggest downfall of duke's, though, is the food. i've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; a burger, a cheesesteak and chicken tenders. the first was flavorless and cold. the second was passable, but nothing special. and the last were absolutely awful. honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, i had to call it an early night. i ate two of the 7 tenders (seven!) and had to quit. \u000atheir fries are very good. and so are the wings.\u000a\u000ai'd say duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.

Vfood is good here. great beer selection on tap. sometimes the beer is on the pricey side. what i want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special. pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches. good place to watch football, hockey, baseball.

Vone of my favorite local eateries. the mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, i wish i could purchase it. i am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. food portion is great. the only complaint i would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family.

Vit wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  while it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  the food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  everyone in the table resented me for "holding back" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\u000a\u000awhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  quesadilla burger.  i knew that was a mistake but i did it anyways.  the patty was sorta flavorful.  the toppings were in the bland category.  cheese went mia.  and the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\u000a\u000aa big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits.

Vdelicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste, but really tasty flavors and spices. we went for all-you-can-eat wings night but sadly i could barely finish my first dozen. beer selection is much improved since  turadg a.'s post; they have about 30 or so available to choose from.

Vthe main reasons to go to buffalo blues would be for their all you can eat ribs night every tuesday for $21 and their all you can eat wings night every wednesday for $9.  make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  you have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  i once went to ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a buffalo chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  yea, he regretted his terrible decision.\u000a\u000aanyways.  the food itself.  the ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  i tend to just go medium, b/c i find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when i eat ribs i care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  the ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  the most i've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because i didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.\u000a\u000apersonally i prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  they have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are buffalo blue, old yeller, and red hot parm.  buffalo blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, old yeller is a carolina mustard based sauce, and red hot parm is a traditional buffalo sauce (frank's red hot + butter) then topped with parmesan cheese.  their cool ranch, garlic parm, and spicy garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, i kind of like their spicy garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  their gold rush and death row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but i prefer buffalo blue to both of them.\u000a\u000afor their spicy flavors, there's red hot, which is just a traditional buffalo, there's howlin' wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's hotter than hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  personally i find howlin' wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  i tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so i'm not big on hotter than hell.\u000a\u000aif i have a big appetite i eat from 24-30 wings.  if its just a regular day i'll eat around 18-22ish wings.\u000a\u000anote: these wings are huge.  they aren't your typical wingzone or quaker steak and lube sized wings.  these are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.\u000a\u000athe rest of the menu is just typical american restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.\u000a\u000ahighly highly recommended.

Vliving down the street of buffalo blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  the huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  for any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good.\u000a\u000athe bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  it's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  but, while they have a good number of hd tvs, only two are broadcast in hd so don't think you'll be getting a great picture.

Vin the last week i've been here twice, partially because i don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! it's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\u000a\u000ai tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than sharp edge's. the sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. to wash it down i had loose cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\u000a\u000aour waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. who makes a new girl work on a friday night! she seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because i wasn't hungry anymore so i didn't care.\u000a\u000athe beer was pricy - tuesday night i had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer...

Vthe front serves as a good pittsburgh sports bar. it's a particularly great place to watch the penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. there are lots of hdtv's and there is a good selection of beer. \u000a\u000athe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. i would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home.

Vi've been here quite a few times, and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt. they have a ton of nice hdtvs.\u000a\u000aeverytime i go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that i get. i was just there for the pitt/oakland game and got a redhook. i drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\u000a\u000athe food is hit or miss. i got the french onion soup last time. it was good. nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. i've had the pork nachos and they were blah.

Vi found buffalo blues to be merely ok.  i thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  i actually liked the wing sauces i tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \u000a\u000ai would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  for $10 i would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was ok.\u000a\u000asurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  a vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products.

Vtried this place to get my charred meat on before a steelers game, and was not disappointed.  boneless buffalo wings are my loovveeeeeeeee so i'm pretty easy to please there, and i was super happy that they allow you to order them in a small portion (5 wings).  i tried a medium spicy sauce (instead of jumping right to hotter 'n hell) because i was sick with anticipation for the steelers game, and it was nice and sweet and not bland.  \u000a\u000apredicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, i had a salad.  i expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!  the lettuce was not all nearly white grossness, the other veggies were nice and crisp, and the toppings were great!  i loovveeed the shredded chicken that didn't have a bunch of gross grease all over it.

Vwednesday is wing night, i.e., eat your face off night. for ~ $9 you can eat unlimited wings (with your choice of various sauces) for several hours. if you can, top it off with a brownie - they're quite good.\u000a\u000ai've mostly had the wings at blues & i like all of the sauces, but the burgers are good, as well. whatever you do, make sure to get the sweet potato fries & tip your waitress! (especially if her name is meg).

Vwing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at william penn on tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day, buffalo blues for all you can eat wings. there are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. they bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. i don't think i have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. the only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.

Vmy local sports bar.  it has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and i don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  \u000ait is a bar.  it has bar food.  nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries, sandwhiches and wings.  on the other hand, i've never had a bad experience either.  so when i eat there, i'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but i am expecting constantcy.  consistancy is what is delivered.  \u000abuffalo blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  \u000aservice is spotty, i do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when i go there.  the plus is, when specific staff is working, the  place is that much of a better establishment.  consistantly just above average in my opinion.\u000ai chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  i would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich i'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.

Vthis is a great place for happy hour, to catch the game, or to have a small-ish private party. definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials, but mon-fri from 5-7pm they have \u000a$1 off all drafts\u000a1/2 priced blues booze\u000a$5 nachos and quesadillas\u000a$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)\u000a\u000aeast end beers are $3 all day, every day.\u000a\u000athe food here is not spectacular, but i've always enjoyed what i've gotten. being from the south, i wouldn't think to order the bbq or catfish here, so i can't vouch for those. the spicy wings, cheese sticks, salads, and grilled cheese are all good. the regulars and servers are pretty nice people. we watched the saint/steelers game here (with our saints attire on!), and easily made friends the whole night. they also have a small "loft" area that you can reserve for free for a private party, and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. finally, they deliver! i love having another delivery option besides chinese and pizza. now i can be lazy and eat a big salad!

Vi ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  we decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of tv's.  the beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  i ended up having the philly shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the long trails porter.  it was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\u000a\u000afor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the blues bbq pork nachos.  we were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  at this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  so we started out with the chicken chili nachos.  they were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  for dinner i decided on having the lovely lisa's salad since i love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  upon receiving the salad i dug in.  the chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  however there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  whenever the waitress came back to check on us i asked about the missing apples.  she went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  i am not normally one to complain but i feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that i should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  it is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\u000a\u000athe bottom line is that i have been here before and the food is generally good.   however, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential.

Vmy coworkers and i had lunch here on a friday afternoon, and it was a pretty "meh" experience for me.  we were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that i didn't even know existed, so apparently buffalo blues is bigger than i thought.  it's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\u000a\u000ai went for the hot veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  the sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  the sandwich left something to be desired.  it wasn't hot, first of all - i'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  the hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  there wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  it was just belly-filler, really.  i guess that's what i get for trying to order healthy here.  \u000a\u000ai just wasn't much interested in it, and i don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  i better have a darn good sandwich if i'm paying $8.  also, it was relatively small in size - i don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  but i guess i think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that i can take half home.  buffalo blues was neither.\u000a\u000anot particularly interested in returning for any reason.

Vthe best thing about buffalo blues revolves around sundays during football season. for me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an nfl game...especially if you're not a steelers fan. on any given sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the nfl taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. seating is the only issue. get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. luckily, the tv's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.\u000a\u000athe draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by east end brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, pbr), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.\u000a\u000aas far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. i've had mostly great service at the bar, but i've also had average to below average service at tables. during bigger sporting events - primarily steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.\u000a\u000aoverall, i have to rate the food as average. i love their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. the fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. i think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. the menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. it's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.\u000a\u000ain the end, i'm giving buffalo blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a "sports bar." as far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. they always get a good crowd for games (whether sundays during the nfl season, saturdays during big college games, or for pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. there's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds i've experience in other sports bars in town. most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in shadyside for lunch and dinner.

Vsuperbowl sunday at the blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the " who really cares about this game"  show. i was mainly interested in seeing madonna. i do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. we had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. at the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. much better view to see the material girl! so our server gets 5 stars! not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. very classy, wish i could remember her name. young girl with dirty blond hair. \u000a\u000athe food was pretty blah in my opinion. bar food none too exceptional. we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. good size. everyone had a burger or sandwich. as i glanced over to my friends pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. she said it was "eh". i ordered a gobbler club sandwich. it was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. how can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and i didn't like it at all. bad texture. the commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but i wouldn't go back to eat. just drinks and sports. i like the location. easy to park. close to shadyside. madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here i most likely won't be back.

Vi've heard about this place, i've seen this place, and i've wanted to try this place. finally, yesterday my company took us their for lunch and i did not leave disappointed. don't get me wrong, this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city, but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger, fries, and drink.\u000a\u000athe atmosphere is total sports bar, but it is not overwhelmingly so. the staff was nice and for being in a party of 14, the server handled us well.\u000a\u000athe food was great! i got the salsa burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. the burger was plump and large, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. i recommend this burger! it also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. tip? get the sweet potato fries!

Vso, i went to buffalo blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what i expected.  just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.\u000a\u000ai'll start with the drinks.  they have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though i didn't have a look at it, so i can't judge; and the happy hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5pm-7pm).   plus they have east end drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of big hop (the only east end choice they have) when i was there (i don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  the bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.\u000a\u000athe menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and southwestern-themed foods from which i picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  although at the end i was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  the meal overall  was good, and since i got it with the happy hour special, i can't complain.  one thing i will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (i'm not vegetarian, but i try not to eat too much meat, so i notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, i would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.\u000a\u000ai know i haven't said much negative about buffalo blues in this review, yet i'm still giving it only three stars.  this is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the "word versions" of the ratings that yelp gives us.  "a-ok," which, if you didn't know, is how yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how i would describe buffalo blues.  the comparison i keep going to in my head is die hard 2.  it's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something i'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.\u000a\u000ato sum it up - i'm not a big sports guy.  buffalo blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (i'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the steelers-ravens i watched at big jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  and, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but "just fine."  but i'm sure i'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.

Vwhen hotlick's died, buffalo blues was born. it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on....\u000a\u000afood is really, really average. i love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. this place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross centre or penn ave. to get real ribs. it, technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe! \u000a\u000athe ambiance: the restaurant is always crowded. not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your "space" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. it's loud as hell!!! forget about a nice quiet dinner. there seems to be no consideration for customers at all. last time i was there, there was a st. patrick's day party (it was not st. patrick's day) that took over the whole place. though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called "party room" i was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. but as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. oh and there are like 100 tvs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\u000a\u000awant to sit in the bar area? good luck. you will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. also it's loud as hell!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000athe "wonderful" staff: it seems like it's everyone's first day. to put it lightly; the staff suck! to be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. the wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. it pains me to leave any tip for them. most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. be prepared to be met with this saying, "oh, like ohmygod, i am so sorry i forgot that, he he!" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). you will get bad service...period (in fact, i can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\u000a\u000athe food: kinda good. menu is huge, you'll find something you like. but i go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. it is way too expensive. do not take a date there. your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. there are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. i grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\u000a\u000athis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!

Vthis review is on lunch at buffalo blues. i have been here a number of times for dinner and for late-night drinks, and have always thought it was a great place to grab a drink and watch a game, but haven't been overly impressed with the food. that is, until yesterday. i came in for a quick bite to eat and ordered the hot veggie sandwich. it was fantastic - the best veggie sandwich i have had here in pittsburgh. other than that, service was good and fairly quick. i made have found my new go-to lunch spot!

Vfood: 2 stars. it's really not very good. especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. blue cheese wasn't bad though. my wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. nice and fresh though. \u000a\u000adrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\u000a\u000aservice: 3 stars. could have been better, could have been worse. friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \u000a\u000aatmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \u000a\u000a1 bonus star for accommodating the pittsburgh area buffalo bills fans! go bills!!!

Voh how the mighty have fallen. this place used to be good. something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\u000a\u000awriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. the beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. i essentially live across the street so i know i'll go back, but i hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen.

Vthe buffalo chicken dip is very good. their wing nights are decent (gold rush/death row are probably the two best flavors in my opinion). wednesday night trivia is also fun (thought it took much longer than expected). \u000a\u000aa good sports bar to say the least, usually went there for world cup and euro cup soccer games as well.

Vgood fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.they have a good selection of wings and decent beer. i try different kinds of wings  every time  i go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. this is a typical sports bar.

Vpass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\u000a\u000athe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  and, its not good.  some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\u000a\u000athe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  they do have a good selection though.\u000a\u000athis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there.

Vthis is the worst service (or worst non-service) i have ever experienced. since i can't give zero stars, i'm giving the service one. we didn't eat anything so i can't comment on the food. \u000a\u000amy husband and i went to buffalo blues last night. we stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. when no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\u000a\u000athe bar was full, but not packed. there were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. after what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. he then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. when he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\u000a\u000ashe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. when we said no she said she would be back. we could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. after another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. we ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\u000a\u000atwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? such a waste of time. it took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. that's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. i used to work as a server so i could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. i will never go back.

Vtheir food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good. \u000a\u000athe problem i have with the place is that buffalo bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes, (or almost makes) so it's like watching the superbowl except it's a losing record team stopping a team on third down.

Vi hate this place. i have been here many times and i am just finally getting around to writing a review.  let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said i need to indulge their interests. even if they suck. \u000a\u000abuffalo blues is like a hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. the service is horrendous and the food may be better at hooters.  the beer selection is decent at buffalo blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\u000a\u000amy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly i don't get it. you get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. the problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  so the max you could eat is 55 wings. did i mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a jackson pollack painting.  they also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  the wings do not come with celery. this is a crime against humanity and the city of buffalo.  \u000a\u000ai chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. apparently this was a bad choice.  it took a full hour to get my food. it was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. when my meal did arrive everything was cold. the sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\u000a\u000ai paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  i would say i won't go back, but apparently i like my friends more than i like good food and service.

Vwent here this past saturday afternoon, 11/2. my friends and i sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. the bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. as we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. we went next door to mad mex and got much better service!

Vi have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \u000a\u000ai love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when i'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on sundays is outstanding.  i'm a giant steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during nfl sundays.  \u000a\u000ahowever, i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  the food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if i thought it was worth the price, but i don't.  not even a little bit.  the only thing i have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  so, it's not really much of a win at all.  also, i want to have a handful of beers during the games, but i don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  so, all in all, i recommend going once and awhile (mainly on sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.

Vi have mixed feelings about this place.  i'll say up front: i only ever go there on sundays for football, and i would never go there for any other reason.  it is the only bar i know of in the city where you can reliably find every nfl game televised and enjoy your sunday if you're not a steelers fan.  pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on sundays, with a disproportional number of bills and redskins fans.  the crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\u000a\u000athey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  that said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  whatever you do, don't order a bloody mary, they're atrociously bad.  the staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on sundays).  that said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\u000a\u000athe food is mediocre and over-priced.  when two of us go for one game on a sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entrée, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  in a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  they have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  it's like eating plain bread).  they have 4 entrée salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  they don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  i know, it's a sports bar, but i don't want to eat the same veggie burger every sunday for 17 weeks.  it gets old.  fast.\u000a\u000aupshot?  in the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.

Vto be honest, i think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  the food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. i do enjoy a good sports bar, but i think the thing i hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. it's the quintessential shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the jersey shore bimbos who pine for them. the last time that i went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. i fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but i still do not like this place at all.

Vunfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues. we sat down and put in our drink order.  my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. we were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. we will not be back.

Vi would take advantage of all you can eat wings on wednesday. \u000a\u000awe went on a regular oll sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had ayce. we tried a variety of sauces (we ordered 20 wings and every 5 can be a different flavor) the buffalo blues sauce was ok. it was just their signature bbq sauce. we also tried garlic parm, honey teriyaki & gold rush. all were ok.\u000a\u000a the boozy buffalo is a good drink. it consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, oj, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of coke. i seriously felt fabulous after one. it's served in a mason jar. ($12)\u000a\u000alauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to lauren for keeping a smile on her face.

Vwatched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated. he was swaying in circles on the chair next to me. i told the manager about it and he told me "that guy is just crazy, i've seen him much worse" so i guess that makes it ok. made this paying customer leave after one beer.

Vhad a wonderful beef and pulled pork burger at buffalo blues yesterday. the food and drinks were great;however, as far as i could discern this sports bar only had one waitress trying to cover over 30 customers. and this on a saturday with the world cup games. i saw only one waitress and a bar man. the gal was valiantly trying to keep up. but the burger was great.

Vthis place is a keeper! \u000a\u000ait was pretty good. i got the cajun chicken sandwich with french fries for take out. \u000a\u000ai waited at the bar, and ordered a drink while i waited. i had the caipirinha... not as good as seviche's, but then again this is buffalo blues.... \u000a\u000aif you need an "all american" food fix, this is the place to be.

Vi may be a little biased... this place is right down the street from my house and we go there frequently, but i think blues is great. \u000a\u000ai have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that i love more than others are the cobb salad and the oscar's garbage burger. \u000a     the cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. i don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads i have ever had. \u000a     and the garabge burger....mmmmmmm. this burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. i lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  i don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!\u000abut that's not all. imagine a primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. it has fries, cole slaw, an egg and american cheese. my bf often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. \u000a\u000athey also have a really good veggie sandwich with hummus (i don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. \u000a\u000aalso, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and great fresh homemade potato chips. \u000a\u000anow, as far as the ribs and wings go, i'm not a big ribs/wings person. i can appreciate that they're good, but i wouldn't order it much. having said that, my bf frequently orders one or the other and i always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....if you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food i highly suggest it!

Vi've been to buffalo blues a few times at happy hour, and met my daughter there last night for happy hour specials as advertised on the web site.  first clue:  no happy hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the yeungs and wings (which was not what we were looking for).  we came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  the food was awful, the service worse.  maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  the service:  one beer to the table at a time.  next round i saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  so we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  we ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  she offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a customer service gesture.  still, we had a happy hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  at least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  i think we're done here.

Vthis is the mcdonald's to end all mcdonald's, in my book. here's why:\u000a\u000a~ the drive-thru is crazy fast.\u000a~ there are 2 drive-thru lanes to keep it crazy fast.\u000a~ even when they have to make my dog's special no-onion cheeseburger, they are crazy fast.\u000a~ for years, they gave my family's dog jamie free baby ice cream cones. jamie didn't need many moments of excitement to be happy, but 'go for ride' was one of them, and 'ice cream time' was another.\u000a~ the drive-thru staff is so sweet to my little pup lucy when i take her to 'cheeseburger window'.\u000a\u000aso, i guess what i'm saying is, this is the best mcdonald's for dogs and their parents. and as someone who generally only visits mcdonald's to reward my dog for good behavior after a vet visit, this mcdonald's is just right.

Vi have never gotten an order correct from this specific mcdonald's. i'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. it is never quick. the staff is always rude. after trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, i've finally given up hope on this place. do not recommend.

Vthis is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which i mean, spendy, but definitely worth it for special occasions).  it is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  whatever karmic intervention gave the 'bustling borough of bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. \u000a\u000abut more importantly the food...  oh, the food!  the owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  i have never had a bad meal.  \u000a\u000ai

Vmy boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. there are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. my boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  there is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. i thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . they are also very generous with the bread which i loved!!!!\u000aevery meal was made to perfection. it had a homey feeling .....\u000amy boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  my entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. there were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. the service was great.\u000a all in all it was an amazing experience. the chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .\u000athis is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.not to dressy and not too casual.\u000a pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.\u000a im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.

Vfinally, i restaurant in pittsburgh that i can give 4 stars!! mitchell's is located on the waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. the interior is a classic, clean, modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood, glass, etc... the menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  but here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get "small plates" at the bar for $3 each, and these ain't no costco fish sticks! two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough french bread they bring out). finally, while the drinks aren't cheap, they're creative, tasty and fresh. all in all, i had a great experience, and i think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.

Vno pictures!  i knew i should have taken my camera!\u000a\u000amy aunt and i went there today for mother's day.  i think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty cheap (i've been to the one in columbus).  my aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes with butter) and i had their shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp, a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon, all done perfectly.  we didn't order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie!  anyway, dinner was great, and so was the service, thus the five stars!

Vthis is one of the few restaurants i frequent in the waterfront. why would you come to mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? you probably wouldn't. but you can swim in the great lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. not many places in pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a pittsburgh mystery to me). the restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. so you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \u000athe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). if you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. they will cook your food one of several ways. i like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. bread is mmmgood and hot (free). staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. i recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. a bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on long island's south shore (but that's another story). salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). bottom line is mitchell's at the waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.

Vmtchells is one of the best fish places around.  i really like their shanghi preparation of my fish. it's just delicious.\u000a\u000athe establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.  \u000a\u000aoddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  it's always so warm and tasty.\u000a\u000athe deserts are also very tasty.  i have gotten two that i really liked\u000a\u000athey also have a three course fixed price option last i went that was a great value. i think it was $20/person for lunch.

Van excellent choice for fresh, well prepared seafood located in the waterfront area in homestead.   i frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.\u000a\u000athe seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  the house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.\u000a\u000athere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  the deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.  \u000a\u000aif you're on the waterfront, you won't do better than this.  enjoy!

Vi was impressed.  \u000a\u000awent here for lunch.  the seafood gumbo was tremendous.  i wasn't in the mood for more seafood so i had the chicken blt on ciabatta bread.  i'm not sure what type of creamy sauce they put on the bread, but it was delicious.  will go back again.\u000a\u000athe food was reasonably priced for lunch.  dinner would obviously be more expensive but i imagine it's worth the $.

Vi did not know this is a franchise restaurant until i had looked it up on the internet. this is the only restaurant i was not familiar with by the waterfront. my mom and me sat on the outdoor patio, the weather was very nice on a breezy summer day. \u000athere was a great prix fixe special for $23, what a great price for regular portion salad---the dressing was too sweet for me---entree and mini dessert.\u000athe fish was fresh. my mom's chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach. the sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced. my lobster and shrimp pappardelle had more shrimp than i expected. my desert was creme brulee, which was very good. i love a good sugar coated dessert.

Vi took my cousin from california here for lunch. we were both eating lite since a) i was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. back to mitchell's, i had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. i also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo i ever tasted. it wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. it was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. it wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. as for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile i need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). the star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. it was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. it complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. the cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. i tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake i've ever tasted. the cream cheese frosting was more buttery than "cheesy", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. there were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which i love. also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than i've tasted in the past. i highly recommend it. it was a wonderful lunch and i'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to riverside.

Vthis place has great seafood. the best in the area. i come here for seafood every time. everything on their menu is good. their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  their clam chowder is the best. really creamy with lots of clams. wonderful restaurant. you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. we love coming to this restaurant. don't forget a reservation on weekends. you will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. we never get to the dessert. always too full to eat dessert.   forgot to take pictures.

Vmitchell's fish market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  and actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  the atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  it wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a friday around 7:30 pm.\u000a\u000aour server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  i started with a house salad, which i told the server i would split with my boyfriend.  she brought it to us on two separate plates, which i thought was a nice touch, and more than what i expected.  poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as i remember, but tasty.\u000a\u000ai ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  my entree was a combo: lobster tail, and "lobster pot pie."  now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but i have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  it wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as i like (i'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  it's just a shame.  dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.\u000a\u000athe lobster pot pie was totes not what i imagined.  i pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  instead....i got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  there was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (i'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  whaaaaaaaat?  it wasn't bad or anything, but not what i imagined.  i was a little bummed out.  \u000a\u000aso everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but i think in future i'd rather just head to the strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  i didn't try their fresh preparations, so i can't say how those were.\u000a\u000ai'd say in the waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  and the atmosphere is great, including the service.

Vdelightful! after biking on the river trail that led us to the waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at mitchell's, right on the river. we parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. the waitress even filled our water bottles for us! the interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. the decor is really tasteful and classy. the outside was perfect. it was sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. we decided just on a few drinks and an app. the two drinks my bf ordered were amazing. the first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (i forget the name). so refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. the second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. both were winners. i stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) the app we got was the hawaiian seared ahi tuna and it was delicious as well. it was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. i believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. it was so good - definitely recommend! my bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which i don't eat, but he said it was very good. he also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. this place definitely earns the stars and i had no idea it was even a chain. the waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. i also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - i'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) i felt like i was on vacation and i'll definitely be back!

Vthis was a great find near pittsburgh alternative to down town scene. ambiance was great on the deck by the river, and service was excellent (thanks melisa for history lessens!). seafood including oysters were fresh and well prepared. price was reasonable for "prefix" menu including scrumptious dessert.  what an evening to end a fantastic summer day in pittsburgh.

Vdrinks: water for me, yuengling for my fiance\u000aappetizers: cup of maine lobster bisque for me -- soo good! my fiance had the new orleans seafood gumbo which i had a taste of it and it was good, but i liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. the bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (i believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but i felt i couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and i can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. my fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence i utter often).\u000aentrees: i had one of the specials, grilled shrimp and scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which i asked for on the side). the seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. my fiance had the special of cod stuffed with lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - i had a taste of his and it was really yummy, i'll def order that next time! we both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (i got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.\u000adessert: didn't order any\u000aservice: friendly, though a little sparse. after we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. but our server was overall friendly and we didn't feel neglected or anything.\u000adeals/discounts: none\u000aoverall: we liked the variety and freshness of seafood. def a place we'd consider going to again, which is the main mark of a very good experience!

Vwe went here for valentines day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. we both loved it. the calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7, they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. \u000a\u000ai had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. the steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being valentines day. despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.\u000a\u000amy wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. we will def be back.

Vi am bummed about this- i had high hopes. here's a rundown of the evening:\u000a\u000apros:\u000a- super friendly waitress, stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout \u000a- yummy elderflower and pear beverage\u000a- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y\u000a- hot delicious bread\u000a\u000acons:\u000a- oysters were sketch. and i don't feel good about that. stephanie brought us an order of east coast oysters to replace the west coast ones that we sent back.\u000a- fresh grated horseradish had no flavor or heat- what's up with that?\u000a- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor. and at a whopping $25 a plate, i expect some nummers!\u000a\u000ai doubt we'll go back- for those prices, i would prefer mccormick's or ruth's chris.

Vservice an atmosphere was great. i had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. much closer to bland than anything.

Vi'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places i've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. the shanghai style merlin was very poorly done. the meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. i have a very low sodium tolerance and yet i still found this fish to be made too bland. the rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as i took my first bite. i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. it wasn't the same. the whole dish was a fail and i don't think i am ever coming back again :(

Vi went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in west homestead, so i decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   \u000a\u000ai was highly disappointed in the service, and i only ordered take out.    upon going to the bar to announce that i was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   the bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    \u000a\u000aafter announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  no offer of water, or a drink.  another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   he then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    he placed a glass of water in front of me.\u000a\u000athen i hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  ."it's takeout"  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.\u000a\u000agentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)\u000a\u000aafter more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  she then rings me up.   i don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.\u000a\u000awhen i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  i now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. \u000a\u000avery disappointing experience.   will not be returning.

Vwill i come here again?  yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the ketel one extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  the ambiance is very nice.  of the 4 types of reviews i give (awesome, ok, bad where they get slammed and bad where i hope they improve) here i am giving the heartfelt "bad where i hope they improve."  our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  i mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  we went with appetizers she recommended.  not good.  \u000a\u000aseared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  not good.  with heartfelt advice, compare this against outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  the chef should do so.  (he's a nice guy like me i hope.)  \u000a\u000abbq shrimp: go try redstone's (philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  it is chilled, very delicious.  this appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  the barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  gordon food service or sysco bbq sauce.  a real "must-miss".  \u000a\u000acod entree was ok.  the skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  potato skin had grit in the mashed.  why 1 star?  the price was close to capital grille, but far from the cuisine.  i hope they spruce it up.  the place is nice.

Vfirst off i have to note, their maine lobster bisque is amazing. definately don't miss out on it. \u000a\u000athat being said, we had lunch there and the lunch portions are a good value. i had the cedar plank salmon. the fish was fantastic, except that the vegetables were a little bland. \u000a\u000athe atmosphere at the restaurant is quite relaxed, and i don't think i've ever seen it get more than mildly busy in there, so it is a nice place to go to have a quiet meal with someone special.

Vi have always had a great dinner at mitchell's but something has changed. went there last night about 5:30, the place was maybe half full. we were seated and when it finally occurred to us that no one had been to the table at all to ask about drinks or even bring water, i started timing.... 14 minutes later we decided to leave. told the hostess what had happened and got a blank stare.  sorry but not going back there again.

Vthe service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal. my meal was way over cooked. the soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and i felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  overall, i thought it was mediocre and i was expecting more for the prices.

Vthe food was really good, but the prices were pretty high and the portions were on the small side. the desserts were the high point of the meal for me. i got the "shark fin" pie and it was really good. the waitress thought i wouldn't be able to finish it... but i showed her. take that, waitress.

Vi have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  i thought it might be a red lobster knock off.  then i asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had, and liked it.\u000a\u000ai was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  very cozy.  much more upscale than i had thought it would be.  the service was terrific.  lots of things to choose from on the menu.  a bit pricier than i had imagined.  most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  but this is pittsburgh and this is seafood.\u000a\u000athat said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  butter was soft which i like.  our entrees came pretty quickly.  i had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  the scallops were just done, i like them cooked a little more.  everything else was pretty good.\u000amy beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.\u000a\u000awe'll probably be back, but will order something different.   we liked it.

Vfood was excellent. went for the sunday brunch and loved it. i highly recommend the steak and eggs with the zucchini pancakes, really an outstanding dish. oh, and if you get the carrot cake....one is enough for everyone! it was huge, and it was soooo goood! i don't know how they can make something taste that good and cook it in such large volumes. really was an excellent experience, my only reason for not giving it a five star review was that there was too much time in between our courses. there was probably a good 40 minutes that passed between our salads and our entrees. that's a little long for me when i'm at a brunch. usually i don't eat a breakfast if i'm going to something like that, so 40 minutes was too long for me.

Vwe had a bigger party and i think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. they forgot about our waters until the food came out, but were super apologetic when they did bring them. the food was ok. i ordered the crab cakes they were a bit heavy on the breading, so i would give them a rating of, "eh". my friend ordered a steak, asked for medium rare, and it came out...well done. he was too hungry to complain and just ate it. we might go back again, and this time maybe take a bit more time looking over the menu.

Vamazing valentines dinner and service! curt was simply a wonderful server and the food was fantastic. \u000a\u000aonly negative was a few overly salted bites. but as someone who is a salt minimalist. that could purely be my palate only.

Vthe tuna was enjoyable and the service was prompt. the house chardonnay was buttery and was a good compliment to the fish. it was a tuesday night so the place was busy but not crowded. since i wasn't "wowed" by the place i won't give it 5 stars but i had no dissatisfaction to speak of. i will be back (if i'm not across the street at the rock bottom brewery).

Vmy husband and i went to mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. we both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). i can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and i've always been please with everything. \u000a\u000apros: nice friendly waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), food was excellent and not extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!\u000a\u000acons: none on this visit or any previous visits

Vlove this place so much. the food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. the service is incredibly slow though, takes forever to our meals! even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. i don't understand i always end up eating here for at least two-four hours. fish is always fresh, lobster is delicate and tasty, and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! love their salads as well. definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? definitely, be prepared to spend at least $20/person!

Vfirst i would like to say that i was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill. \u000athat being said, i came here and was delighted by my server michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. \u000ai originally ordered the mahi mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. hence, the tuna. \u000anow the tuna was amazing. seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact. \u000ai would most definitely come back again and if i lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots.

Vi love mitchell's fish market.  95% of the time, the food is amazing but, when they mess up, they move heaven and earth to make it better.  the last time we were at mitchell's, i ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  my lobster was underdone.  the server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though i had eaten most of it.  then, to make our night even better, comped us a dessert.  it's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back.

Vthe lobster rolls were delicious, the blackened fish tacos were light and flaky, not too spicy and had a nice salsa.  the white sangria was very refreshing and not too alcoholic.  the outdoor view of the river was really enjoyable and the service was quick.

Vmitchell's is located on the river side of the waterfront and out of the crazy "let's fight to find a parking spot" area.  they do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  it wasn't busy when i was there on a tuesday at noon.\u000a\u000amitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  \u000a\u000athis is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  you can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  i had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  delicious!  \u000a\u000athe price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  for that price, you really can't complain.  i drop almost that much at panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  \u000a\u000ai'm sure it's much busier for dinner but i find mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  i've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent bloody mary and eggs benedict with crab.

Vwent for dinner friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. it is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. the sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. the chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. the cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. i had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. it was so delicious. my friend had the creme  brûlée, which she said was very good. i was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.

Vmy family and i go here whenever there is a special occasion and for good reason. the food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat, at least not when it's coming from the governor or kennedy. best servers in the 'burgh!! i took my dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday, didn't tell anyone that it was a special night out, but they treated us with such attention, accommodating our needs to a t. kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste, suggested things based on what we were looking for, took at least 10 minutes with us going over the menu...i could go on, but needless to say, it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny. we got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start, lobster bisque soup, cedar plank salmon, chilean sea bass, and a fish medley made to order. we also always get the 7 layer carrot cake, which to me is the best cake anywhere in town.  a must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service. but be sure and ask for kennedy, he's a real dude.

Vhave been here a few times. the wait staff is always top notch and food is very good. i had the steak and lobster tail. steak was a perfect medium rare and the lobster was also cooked well. oysters as an app. they appeared fresh and tasted how they should. overall like in the past we had a great experience at mitchells which is not something i always expect from a chain.

Vtop points. \u000aservice. i was there with a large group for a meeting. they gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. they were efficient and very accommodating. kudos. \u000a\u000aappetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. both were good. servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. i'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. dip was good. calamari was done well. preferred the shrimp cocktail sauce with it versus the asian type soy sauce that is served with it. \u000a\u000awedge salad with bleu cheese. waaaaaay too much cheese and i like bleu cheese. \u000a\u000ai had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. simple green beans would have been more appetizing. \u000atuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. was not over cooked. potatoes as expected. \u000aother dishes seen--fisherman's platter. looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. crab cakes and filet looked okay. \u000a\u000aoverall i'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. i guess with chain places you get that, but i want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.

Va ok!\u000a\u000areally loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! so amazing with the sauce on the side. this was probably the the best part of the meal.  \u000a\u000ai also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. the spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... which is better in the long run,  but i wish they had options for sauteed with garlic. \u000a\u000athe service was great as well!  we were always taken care of.  \u000a\u000awill definitely bring my bf here in the future.

Vthis was my first time at this location.  i've frequented the upper st clair galleria restaurant.  there's a lot to like about this columbus oh based chain.  i don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will i review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  this place seems different to me.  the food quality and care seems to be very high.  \u000a\u000athe staff is always well trained.  i like the decor and ambiance.  the menu offers many options.  i don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall i am a fan.  i do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  i like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.  \u000a\u000awe were here for a thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  the room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  it's a tough thing to do.  it wasn't perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh.  nicely done.

Vwe went here for thanksgiving dinner; we had called ahead to check out vegan options, but the person on the other end was a little grumpy about the matter, but there's so little open on that day, there was little choice except to make sure i ate a big lunch earlier.\u000a\u000ai ordered the thai salad, which is probably the only vegan item on the menu - really just a coleslaw with a peanut sauce and some funky chips.  i also ordered some grilled vegetables.  both were good, but not amazing. \u000a\u000athe beer selection was really bad (i mean, dive bar stuff), however the slightly pricey wine selection redeemed the place, and we had a great red and white.  \u000a\u000athe service too was pretty good, but i simply can't recommend going here due to the poor selection of vegan items.

Vmy husbands first time.  nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  i had a trio of jamaican jerk tilapia,  salmon,  and scallops.  all good but too much sauce on scallops.  husband had surf n turf special. snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than i expected. glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  for $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  we taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  for the price i would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying thank you. after every single sentence,  even when it wasn't appropriate.  silly gripe,  right?  but it was way over the top and felt more like,  can i have a tip?  can i have a tip?

Vin the homestead area of pittsburgh. seafood gumbo was very good.\u000abroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. with two glasses of wine the total was $83. in and out in an hour.\u000ai'd go back because the fish was that good
